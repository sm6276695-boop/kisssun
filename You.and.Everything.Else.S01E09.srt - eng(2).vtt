00:00:15.765 --> 00:00:17.851
Can you move a bit? Let me come in.

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:27.610
What are you doing?

00:00:27.694 --> 00:00:28.653
Bring that in.

00:00:32.574 --> 00:00:34.576
I have cancer. It's too heavy for me.

00:00:34.659 --> 00:00:36.286
What are you doing?

00:00:40.206 --> 00:00:41.583
You've really

00:00:42.834 --> 00:00:44.169
grown cold, haven't you?

00:00:48.923 --> 00:00:49.966
Will you kick me out?

00:00:50.717 --> 00:00:52.844
I'm not budging. Just shut the door.

00:00:55.722 --> 00:00:58.975
I thought this was your studio,
but I guess you live here.

00:01:02.645 --> 00:01:04.022
Is that a spare room?

00:01:10.987 --> 00:01:12.238
What do you want?

00:01:12.781 --> 00:01:14.449
Let me crash here for three days.

00:01:17.577 --> 00:01:19.579
I heard you're griping about me
bothering you

00:01:19.662 --> 00:01:22.290
when I wouldn't even face you
while I'm sick.

00:01:23.416 --> 00:01:25.585
That's why I'm here. To show you.

00:01:26.336 --> 00:01:28.463
I knew what you'd be thinking about me.

00:01:29.839 --> 00:01:31.674
And what do I think about you?

00:01:31.758 --> 00:01:34.052
That I'm an egotistical germaphobe

00:01:35.386 --> 00:01:40.725
who's talking about Switzerland
and making a fuss long before my time.

00:01:41.351 --> 00:01:42.644
If you know, then leave.

00:01:45.063 --> 00:01:46.231
I'm so tired.

00:01:46.731 --> 00:01:48.233
I'm absolutely exhausted.

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:51.945
I could drop dead.

00:01:55.448 --> 00:01:56.908
What are you even…

00:02:03.164 --> 00:02:04.999
Am I a joke to you?

00:02:08.086 --> 00:02:09.504
Who do you think you are…

00:02:16.052 --> 00:02:18.221
to just walk all over me like this?

00:02:22.433 --> 00:02:24.394
You're no joke. You scare me.

00:02:31.693 --> 00:02:33.862
If I think about what I did to you,

00:02:34.362 --> 00:02:35.989
I know I shouldn't be here.

00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:44.581
Let's just say I've decided to take
a more shameless approach.

00:02:58.094 --> 00:03:00.930
That's my alarm.
It's time to take my medicine.

00:03:02.307 --> 00:03:03.516
Goodness me.

00:03:06.352 --> 00:03:10.231
I need to eat this
before I can take the medicine.

00:03:14.402 --> 00:03:15.612
Let's see.

00:03:16.779 --> 00:03:18.323
How can I heat this up?

00:03:19.741 --> 00:03:20.575
Using this?

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:24.329
What buttons do I press?

00:03:29.751 --> 00:03:30.668
Maybe this?

00:03:33.922 --> 00:03:35.340
Take your meds, then go.

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:38.009
I need a spoon too.

00:03:43.431 --> 00:03:46.768
I bet you're thinking,
"She's eating just fine."

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:58.071
Is this for drinking?

00:03:59.656 --> 00:04:00.490
Is it?

00:04:07.956 --> 00:04:11.960
The closer I watched her,
the less unwell she seemed.

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:18.800
So where can I sleep?

00:04:24.973 --> 00:04:26.516
Leaving now isn't an option.

00:04:29.477 --> 00:04:32.397
My meds make me sleepy,
so I need to nap in 20 minutes.

00:04:36.317 --> 00:04:37.485
Okay.

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:40.780
Fine.

00:04:40.863 --> 00:04:42.949
I'll leave after my nap. Happy now?

00:05:05.179 --> 00:05:06.973
I'd be fine on the couch.

00:05:07.056 --> 00:05:09.600
I'm not letting you sleep in here
for your sake.

00:05:10.435 --> 00:05:11.728
You're distracting.

00:05:11.811 --> 00:05:13.479
Serves me right, doesn't it?

00:05:15.648 --> 00:05:17.025
How things have turned out.

00:05:21.946 --> 00:05:24.073
You're allowed to think that way.

00:05:26.617 --> 00:05:29.412
I miss your mom's hand-torn noodles.

00:05:46.763 --> 00:05:48.890
CHEON SANG-YEON

00:05:54.687 --> 00:05:56.522
She was like this back then as well.

00:05:56.898 --> 00:05:58.441
11 YEARS AGO, SPRING OF 2013

00:05:58.524 --> 00:05:59.901
One day,

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:02.528
out of the blue…

00:06:02.612 --> 00:06:03.863
Come take a seat.

00:06:11.704 --> 00:06:12.914
We should never have

00:06:14.165 --> 00:06:16.167
crossed paths again that day.

00:06:56.999 --> 00:07:00.920
YOU AND EVERYTHING ELSE

00:07:03.798 --> 00:07:10.054
2 WEEKS BEFORE MEETING SANG-YEON

00:07:18.479 --> 00:07:20.189
Producer Ryu!

00:07:21.649 --> 00:07:24.193
Look who it is! Hello, Producer Oh.

00:07:24.277 --> 00:07:25.528
Yes, hello to you too.

00:07:25.611 --> 00:07:26.612
Good morning.

00:07:26.696 --> 00:07:28.322
Good morning to you too.

00:07:33.911 --> 00:07:35.163
You're looking peppy.

00:07:36.539 --> 00:07:37.665
Should I tone it down?

00:07:39.333 --> 00:07:43.212
Every morning, it felt like a slog
to wake up and get myself to work.

00:07:43.713 --> 00:07:46.549
Nowadays, I wake up instantly
when my alarm goes off.

00:07:48.384 --> 00:07:50.761
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

00:07:51.721 --> 00:07:53.264
-Hello.
-Hello.

00:07:53.347 --> 00:07:54.265
Morning.

00:07:55.141 --> 00:07:56.726
He's late? That's a first.

00:07:57.226 --> 00:08:00.021
Yu-chan took today and tomorrow off
for his mom's surgery.

00:08:00.104 --> 00:08:01.439
I forgot about that.

00:08:01.522 --> 00:08:05.359
How do you know everything
about Song Yu-chan?

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:08.154
I know everything about you too,
Producer Cho.

00:08:11.115 --> 00:08:12.950
What the…

00:08:13.034 --> 00:08:14.869
What would she know about me?

00:08:14.952 --> 00:08:16.496
You're so oblivious.

00:08:16.579 --> 00:08:18.331
She's clearly mocking you.

00:08:18.956 --> 00:08:21.542
She really has a way
of getting under your skin.

00:08:21.626 --> 00:08:24.253
It's no secret
she's got something going on with Yu-chan.

00:08:26.506 --> 00:08:29.425
It's clear your success
is making them jealous.

00:08:29.509 --> 00:08:31.427
They're always sneering at you.

00:08:31.511 --> 00:08:33.638
I couldn't care less.

00:08:34.138 --> 00:08:36.349
The office does feel quieter

00:08:36.849 --> 00:08:39.268
without Yu-chan, don't you think?

00:08:41.729 --> 00:08:42.897
Hey.

00:08:44.524 --> 00:08:46.943
Are you sure
there's no spark between you two?

00:08:47.527 --> 00:08:50.571
Even if he were the chairman's son,

00:08:50.655 --> 00:08:52.573
I would never date a colleague.

00:08:52.657 --> 00:08:54.158
Imagine the breakup.

00:08:54.659 --> 00:08:57.870
Even I would say no to the chairman's son.

00:09:00.373 --> 00:09:02.625
Hui-jin, guess what I'm doing today?

00:09:06.003 --> 00:09:08.756
TO: JU DONG-HYANG
GOOD MAN DIRECTOR'S CONTRACT

00:09:08.839 --> 00:09:09.674
MAIL SENT

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:15.846
Sir, I'm meeting Director Ju.
Do you have anything to tell him?

00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:17.932
Tell him I appreciate all his hard work.

00:09:18.015 --> 00:09:20.601
And that drinks are on me
after the investment review.

00:09:20.685 --> 00:09:21.519
Sure.

00:09:28.234 --> 00:09:31.195
What's so exciting
about meeting with the director?

00:09:39.704 --> 00:09:41.998
Did you read the contract?

00:09:43.457 --> 00:09:47.461
It's so moving
to finally sign on as the director.

00:09:47.545 --> 00:09:49.255
On the day I sign the contract,

00:09:49.338 --> 00:09:51.215
I'll treat us to some barbecue!

00:09:51.299 --> 00:09:52.133
Korean beef?

00:09:53.676 --> 00:09:55.720
Korean beef? Sure, why not?

00:09:55.803 --> 00:09:56.929
Let's eat Korean beef.

00:09:58.306 --> 00:10:00.474
We should be the ones treating you.

00:10:00.558 --> 00:10:04.061
Mr. Jeong says he'll treat you
once the investment review is done.

00:10:06.063 --> 00:10:10.526
Please take your time with the contract
until the investment review is done.

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:13.529
Has the investment review
still not been scheduled?

00:10:13.613 --> 00:10:17.533
Our boss is on a business trip,
so it will be scheduled for next week.

00:10:18.034 --> 00:10:18.868
I see.

00:10:18.951 --> 00:10:20.620
You have nothing to worry about.

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:24.582
The script is solid,
and the Lee Seung-jae is on board.

00:10:26.167 --> 00:10:27.335
Lee Seung-jae.

00:10:27.418 --> 00:10:28.336
GOOD MAN CHARACTER MAP

00:10:28.419 --> 00:10:29.587
I guess you're right.

00:10:30.588 --> 00:10:34.467
For cinematography and art, are you set on
Park Sun-ho and Jeong Ji-yun?

00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:36.677
For cinematography,

00:10:36.761 --> 00:10:39.096
how about Kim Sang-hak?

00:10:41.265 --> 00:10:43.059
Cinematographer Kim Sang-hak?

00:10:43.142 --> 00:10:45.895
Yes. You've seen the movie
Wasteland, right?

00:10:46.395 --> 00:10:47.229
Yes.

00:10:48.397 --> 00:10:49.523
But from what I hear,

00:10:50.024 --> 00:10:54.487
Cinematographer Kim is currently working
on Director Lee Chan-seok's project.

00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:57.490
-Over in South America--
-He got back two days ago.

00:10:57.573 --> 00:11:02.328
He withdrew from the project
when they ditched Director Lee Chan-seok.

00:11:04.664 --> 00:11:05.706
Is that so?

00:11:09.251 --> 00:11:11.212
Why? Do you think he's a bad fit?

00:11:11.962 --> 00:11:14.256
No, why would I think he's a bad fit?

00:11:15.883 --> 00:11:20.638
I'll discuss this with my boss
then check his availability.

00:11:20.721 --> 00:11:22.473
If he is open to joining us,

00:11:22.556 --> 00:11:25.518
please prioritize meeting him
before others snatch him away.

00:11:26.352 --> 00:11:27.853
-All right.
-Great.

00:11:27.937 --> 00:11:29.980
Just know that my boss may object.

00:11:32.316 --> 00:11:34.568
Why does it seem like you want him to?

00:11:34.652 --> 00:11:35.986
Me?

00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:37.279
Why, that's absurd.

00:11:37.363 --> 00:11:38.614
Why would I?

00:11:58.968 --> 00:11:59.802
Sir.

00:12:03.639 --> 00:12:04.765
Do you have a minute?

00:12:04.849 --> 00:12:06.475
The division head needs me.

00:12:07.143 --> 00:12:10.354
The guy who withdrew
along with Director Lee Chan-seok?

00:12:11.564 --> 00:12:12.481
Yes.

00:12:13.357 --> 00:12:14.734
What are your thoughts?

00:12:17.486 --> 00:12:20.030
I think he did a decent job on Wasteland.

00:12:27.997 --> 00:12:29.290
If you're happy, I'll proceed.

00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:35.755
But our movie's a CGI-heavy blockbuster.

00:12:35.838 --> 00:12:37.590
I'm not sure he has the experience.

00:12:40.259 --> 00:12:44.305
Then again, considering that
the picky Director Lee chose him…

00:12:46.724 --> 00:12:48.517
Okay. Let's go with him.

00:12:54.774 --> 00:12:58.068
CINEMATOGRAPHER
KIM SANG-HAK

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:03.115
I can't believe
I still remember this number.

00:13:14.001 --> 00:13:17.171
Hello. I'm calling for
Cinematographer Kim Sang-hak…

00:13:23.177 --> 00:13:24.011
Yes.

00:13:25.262 --> 00:13:27.890
How have you… been?

00:13:33.521 --> 00:13:36.440
Well, I'm only reaching out
about a project.

00:13:37.316 --> 00:13:39.527
Would you be available tomorrow?

00:13:51.497 --> 00:13:52.498
Why…

00:14:27.366 --> 00:14:28.284
It's been a while.

00:14:29.243 --> 00:14:31.579
It has. Let's go inside.

00:14:38.252 --> 00:14:40.671
I heard about
Director Lee Chan-seok's movie.

00:14:42.506 --> 00:14:43.340
Word travels fast.

00:14:44.008 --> 00:14:45.259
As it always does.

00:14:45.759 --> 00:14:48.220
Do you have another project lined up?

00:14:48.304 --> 00:14:49.138
Not yet.

00:14:49.221 --> 00:14:51.432
If so, could you have
a look at one of ours?

00:14:54.143 --> 00:14:56.729
The director wants to work with you.

00:14:56.812 --> 00:15:00.065
He says he met you
at the Busan International Film Festival.

00:15:02.109 --> 00:15:03.444
I see.

00:15:03.944 --> 00:15:06.238
You're working
with Director Ju Dong-hyang.

00:15:06.322 --> 00:15:07.156
Yes.

00:15:07.656 --> 00:15:09.575
Have you ever seen this webtoon?

00:15:09.658 --> 00:15:13.245
Good Man is a well-known webtoon
we're adapting.

00:15:13.329 --> 00:15:14.914
We've cast Lee Seung-jae.

00:15:14.997 --> 00:15:17.291
Wow, Lee Seung-jae? That's amazing.

00:15:17.374 --> 00:15:20.920
Once investment is approved next week,
we'll begin pre-production.

00:15:21.003 --> 00:15:23.672
Lee Seung-jae is due to enlist,

00:15:23.756 --> 00:15:26.133
so filming must start by June
at the latest.

00:15:27.593 --> 00:15:28.844
So I need to decide fast?

00:15:29.428 --> 00:15:30.679
That would be helpful.

00:15:37.144 --> 00:15:38.270
How's your mother?

00:15:40.064 --> 00:15:40.981
Is she well?

00:15:44.485 --> 00:15:45.527
She's well.

00:16:03.379 --> 00:16:04.380
What is it?

00:16:05.673 --> 00:16:07.967
I knew you were at JD,

00:16:08.467 --> 00:16:10.803
so I thought
our paths would cross eventually.

00:16:11.637 --> 00:16:15.182
But it's strange to be receiving
a work proposal from you.

00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:21.689
What's there to feel strange about?
Just think of it as business.

00:16:22.356 --> 00:16:24.692
I can't get used to
you addressing me formally.

00:16:26.235 --> 00:16:27.486
Well, get used to it.

00:16:27.569 --> 00:16:29.738
I'm here to see you for work.

00:16:35.494 --> 00:16:36.453
Excuse me.

00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:41.375
Hey, Yu-chan. I'm in a meeting.

00:16:42.376 --> 00:16:45.087
No, we're done here.
I was just about to leave.

00:16:46.338 --> 00:16:47.256
Yes.

00:16:48.257 --> 00:16:50.634
I'll call you back shortly. Okay.

00:16:53.595 --> 00:16:55.514
Have a look, and please let me know.

00:16:55.597 --> 00:16:56.515
Okay.

00:16:59.601 --> 00:17:00.644
Do you have a card?

00:17:01.228 --> 00:17:02.104
Right.

00:17:13.741 --> 00:17:16.160
Cinematographer Kim Sang-hak is that guy?

00:17:16.243 --> 00:17:18.454
Photography club guy from university?

00:17:19.079 --> 00:17:20.873
The protagonist of your grad film?

00:17:21.999 --> 00:17:23.751
A film is just a film.

00:17:24.334 --> 00:17:26.545
Okay, fiction it is.

00:17:27.713 --> 00:17:29.923
Yu-chan's mother's surgery went well.

00:17:30.632 --> 00:17:32.885
He seemed anxious
that the surgery ran long.

00:17:33.385 --> 00:17:35.679
He'll be taken aback
when he hears about this.

00:17:35.763 --> 00:17:37.973
-About what?
-Don't play coy.

00:17:38.057 --> 00:17:40.476
That your ex may join you
as cinematographer.

00:17:40.976 --> 00:17:43.312
We don't know yet. He could say no.

00:17:43.395 --> 00:17:44.772
Who in their right mind

00:17:44.855 --> 00:17:48.233
would say no to a 12-billion-won tentpole
starring Lee Seung-jae?

00:17:50.819 --> 00:17:52.529
You sure you're okay with this?

00:17:53.030 --> 00:17:55.741
Would you be okay?
Of course I'm uncomfortable.

00:17:55.824 --> 00:17:57.951
Then why didn't you tell Mr. Jeong?

00:17:58.035 --> 00:17:59.661
It's work.

00:18:00.162 --> 00:18:02.664
I don't want to be petty
when it comes to business.

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:06.835
I admit I was anxious before meeting him,

00:18:07.586 --> 00:18:09.505
but I felt nothing when I saw him.

00:18:12.633 --> 00:18:14.885
Hey, the stew is getting cold.

00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:26.355
The investment review's set for Wednesday.
God, I'm nervous.

00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:28.774
What do I do?

00:18:36.115 --> 00:18:36.949
You're that happy?

00:18:38.742 --> 00:18:40.160
Absolutely.

00:18:40.244 --> 00:18:44.248
It took two years to draft a report
with the director's name.

00:18:44.331 --> 00:18:45.874
Don't ever forget

00:18:45.958 --> 00:18:49.628
that even the nicest directors
turn into bastards once they're on set.

00:18:50.379 --> 00:18:51.797
I know.

00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:52.923
Of course you do.

00:18:59.346 --> 00:19:00.597
DRAFT PRODUCTION SCHEDULE

00:19:09.022 --> 00:19:10.399
How late?

00:19:11.233 --> 00:19:14.194
Maybe 11:00?
I think I finished around 11:00 p.m.

00:19:14.278 --> 00:19:17.447
Why finish work that's due tomorrow?

00:19:17.531 --> 00:19:19.741
I know, but I just couldn't stop.

00:19:22.703 --> 00:19:23.620
Gosh.

00:19:25.164 --> 00:19:26.915
This sure tastes good.

00:19:28.125 --> 00:19:29.877
I really should quit.

00:19:44.641 --> 00:19:47.477
It's Kim Sang-hak.
He says he'll take the job.

00:19:47.561 --> 00:19:51.148
He sure didn't take long
to make up his mind, did he?

00:19:51.648 --> 00:19:53.150
I won't tell you if you tease.

00:19:53.233 --> 00:19:55.861
Come on, it's all in good fun.

00:19:55.944 --> 00:19:59.656
Do you really think I'd encourage you
to get back together with your ex?

00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:02.492
Why revisit a messy breakup?

00:20:02.576 --> 00:20:04.870
The breakup wasn't that messy.

00:20:06.205 --> 00:20:08.916
When I think about it now,
it's understandable.

00:20:08.999 --> 00:20:11.335
People are drawn to who they're drawn to.

00:20:12.419 --> 00:20:14.880
So, if you could go back,
would you have stayed?

00:20:16.798 --> 00:20:18.050
Not a chance.

00:20:18.133 --> 00:20:20.594
I'd break up with him
a hundred times over.

00:20:21.094 --> 00:20:23.972
Who's the jerk you'd break up with
a hundred times over?

00:20:24.056 --> 00:20:25.057
Yu-chan!

00:20:25.641 --> 00:20:28.227
Jeez, you uncivilized smokers.

00:20:34.399 --> 00:20:36.610
-Where are you headed?
-A meeting.

00:20:36.693 --> 00:20:37.945
Mr. Jeong.

00:20:38.028 --> 00:20:39.821
Kim Sang-hak will sign on.

00:20:39.905 --> 00:20:41.448
-I'll set up a meeting.
-Sure.

00:20:41.531 --> 00:20:43.867
-I thought you could join--
-Yeah, okay.

00:20:45.786 --> 00:20:48.288
Did something happen?
Why is he so out of it?

00:20:49.081 --> 00:20:49.957
I don't know.

00:20:51.333 --> 00:20:54.002
-I'm going to the restroom.
-Go on.

00:20:58.465 --> 00:20:59.424
Hey.

00:21:03.845 --> 00:21:05.973
Something has happened to you, actually.

00:21:06.056 --> 00:21:06.890
To me?

00:21:07.599 --> 00:21:10.519
-Know who she's setting up a meeting with?
-Who?

00:21:10.602 --> 00:21:11.895
Her ex-boyfriend.

00:21:13.188 --> 00:21:14.273
"Ex-boyfriend"?

00:21:14.356 --> 00:21:16.525
This is Cinematographer Kim Sang-hak.

00:21:16.608 --> 00:21:18.026
Glad to work with you.

00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:19.486
-Likewise.
-Great.

00:21:20.153 --> 00:21:23.824
And I'm Producer Ryu Eun-jung.
A pleasure to work with you.

00:21:26.034 --> 00:21:29.329
Why didn't you tell me
that you two knew each other?

00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:30.664
Sorry?

00:21:33.625 --> 00:21:35.127
I hear you were in the same club.

00:21:35.210 --> 00:21:38.213
You pretended not to know him
when I first mentioned him.

00:21:40.382 --> 00:21:41.508
Did I?

00:21:41.591 --> 00:21:43.343
And so what if I did?

00:21:46.596 --> 00:21:48.098
You're acting even stranger.

00:21:48.181 --> 00:21:51.351
-I was--
-I dropped out halfway through university.

00:21:52.561 --> 00:21:54.604
And I joined the military.

00:21:54.688 --> 00:21:55.814
I see.

00:21:55.897 --> 00:21:58.650
-So you weren't there at the same time?
-Yes.

00:21:58.734 --> 00:22:01.528
Producer Ryu dropped out
and went to film school,

00:22:01.611 --> 00:22:03.572
while you went to the film academy?

00:22:03.655 --> 00:22:04.489
Correct.

00:22:05.615 --> 00:22:08.076
Even so, you two
were in the same club, so--

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:10.037
How did you like the script?

00:22:11.997 --> 00:22:14.374
-I made a reservation at Takoharu.
-Really?

00:22:14.458 --> 00:22:16.418
Congratulations, Director Ju.

00:22:16.501 --> 00:22:17.961
Thank you, Producer Oh.

00:22:19.254 --> 00:22:20.172
You clocking out?

00:22:20.255 --> 00:22:21.298
We're having dinner.

00:22:21.882 --> 00:22:23.675
-Well, I'll see you around.
-Yes.

00:22:23.759 --> 00:22:24.593
Bye, then.

00:22:35.187 --> 00:22:37.230
Come on! Dang it!

00:22:37.314 --> 00:22:39.649
You should've come sooner!
He was just here.

00:22:39.733 --> 00:22:43.236
Those scenes were obviously shot
because they were necessary.

00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:45.322
I'm not saying they weren't necessary.

00:22:45.906 --> 00:22:47.783
I'm merely suggesting

00:22:47.866 --> 00:22:52.371
that it's not essential to show
exactly how the limbs were ripped apart.

00:22:52.454 --> 00:22:54.539
It doesn't need to be so explicit.

00:22:54.623 --> 00:22:58.377
That's true, but is that a valid reason
to hate the movie itself?

00:22:58.460 --> 00:23:01.296
It's valid enough for me.
How is it any different from porn?

00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:02.756
Pure primal stimulation.

00:23:03.256 --> 00:23:04.883
How did you like the movie?

00:23:06.385 --> 00:23:09.096
We always argue like this
when we talk about movies.

00:23:10.097 --> 00:23:13.141
I agree that the scene
didn't have to be so explicit,

00:23:13.809 --> 00:23:15.227
but I enjoyed the movie.

00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:20.232
With such an extensive list of pet peeves,
how do you watch so many movies?

00:23:21.066 --> 00:23:22.317
Because it's work.

00:23:22.401 --> 00:23:24.694
I am a movie producer, after all.

00:23:24.778 --> 00:23:27.656
Producer Ryu sees every movie
at the box office.

00:23:28.782 --> 00:23:30.200
Are there any movies you liked?

00:23:32.035 --> 00:23:33.245
There were lots.

00:23:34.413 --> 00:23:36.873
In recent years,

00:23:37.541 --> 00:23:38.792
I liked Moneyball.

00:23:40.794 --> 00:23:43.004
And Mike Leigh's Another Year.

00:23:43.088 --> 00:23:44.464
I also liked Still Walking.

00:23:45.632 --> 00:23:48.718
Sure, it's great to find a gem of a movie,

00:23:49.344 --> 00:23:51.263
but I usually focus on the production.

00:23:51.346 --> 00:23:53.557
A great movie, to me,

00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:56.059
is one that's well-planned
and breaks even.

00:23:56.143 --> 00:23:57.853
So it's all about the money.

00:23:57.936 --> 00:23:59.771
This goes beyond just money.

00:23:59.855 --> 00:24:04.025
Whatever the movie may be,
it's the duty of a good producer

00:24:04.526 --> 00:24:05.735
to help it break even.

00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:09.322
Cheers.

00:24:18.915 --> 00:24:19.791
-See you soon!
-Yes.

00:24:19.875 --> 00:24:21.960
-Take care on your way home.
-All right.

00:24:22.043 --> 00:24:23.003
Take care.

00:24:28.091 --> 00:24:29.885
The next cab's yours, Director Kim.

00:24:31.470 --> 00:24:32.971
After you, Producer Ryu.

00:24:33.763 --> 00:24:36.057
No, I should see you off.

00:24:40.854 --> 00:24:43.315
Production never leaves
before the filming crew.

00:24:46.735 --> 00:24:47.569
Please get in.

00:24:49.946 --> 00:24:51.364
Sir, can you go to Ilyeong?

00:24:51.448 --> 00:24:52.741
I can. Please get in.

00:24:53.992 --> 00:24:55.494
Still, you should go first today.

00:24:59.623 --> 00:25:00.665
All right, then.

00:25:01.208 --> 00:25:02.375
Take care.

00:25:28.068 --> 00:25:29.945
GOOD MAN
PRODUCTION INVESTMENT MEETING

00:25:32.030 --> 00:25:33.198
Is everything working?

00:25:33.281 --> 00:25:34.783
I think so. Let me check.

00:25:42.082 --> 00:25:44.626
I think that means we're all in agreement.

00:25:45.126 --> 00:25:47.712
Great work, Mr. Jeong.

00:25:48.296 --> 00:25:49.339
It wasn't me.

00:25:49.422 --> 00:25:51.967
I have Producer Ryu to thank, really.

00:25:52.050 --> 00:25:54.511
She's great at shaping scripts
and is our team's best.

00:25:55.595 --> 00:25:56.763
Oh, no, it's nothing.

00:25:57.264 --> 00:26:01.726
Our director, Ju Dong-hyang,
put his heart into writing the script.

00:26:03.186 --> 00:26:06.189
Do we have an update
on Director Gyeong Seung-ju?

00:26:06.690 --> 00:26:07.607
He's on board.

00:26:08.108 --> 00:26:10.235
He seems to have enjoyed the script,

00:26:10.318 --> 00:26:15.699
and Mr. Jeong tells me that
Director Gyeong was a fan of the webtoon.

00:26:15.782 --> 00:26:16.950
Great.

00:26:17.033 --> 00:26:20.453
Then let's approve investment
for Good Man on the condition

00:26:20.537 --> 00:26:22.247
that Gyeong Seung-ju directs.

00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:26.876
Director Gyeong Seung-ju, sir?

00:26:29.629 --> 00:26:30.547
Producer Ryu.

00:26:32.007 --> 00:26:32.841
Wait.

00:26:33.967 --> 00:26:37.929
You're not suggesting
that we switch directors, are you?

00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:40.807
Let's discuss this later.

00:26:47.981 --> 00:26:48.815
Sir, this movie--

00:26:48.898 --> 00:26:50.150
Producer Ryu.

00:26:51.192 --> 00:26:52.402
I think we're done, sir.

00:26:53.278 --> 00:26:54.738
I'll leave you all to it.

00:26:54.821 --> 00:26:57.866
Let's make sure all departments
are fully prepared. Keep it up.

00:27:02.370 --> 00:27:03.496
Great meeting, all.

00:27:05.832 --> 00:27:07.792
From planning to the third manuscript,

00:27:07.876 --> 00:27:11.004
it was all Director Ju. He did everything.

00:27:11.087 --> 00:27:14.883
You know he's been paying his assistants
out of his own pocket!

00:27:18.136 --> 00:27:20.305
The budget is a whopping 12 billion won.

00:27:20.388 --> 00:27:22.849
A rookie director just won't cut it.

00:27:23.350 --> 00:27:26.645
What can I do if they want someone
with a proven box office track record?

00:27:26.728 --> 00:27:29.731
Frankly speaking, this isn't even
Director Ju's original script.

00:27:30.231 --> 00:27:31.691
The source material is strong--

00:27:31.775 --> 00:27:32.984
It was Director Ju

00:27:33.068 --> 00:27:37.947
who suggested we acquire the copyright
when no one knew of the source material.

00:27:38.031 --> 00:27:41.284
He's also the one
who insisted on casting Lee Seung-jae,

00:27:41.368 --> 00:27:42.827
even when it took two years.

00:27:42.911 --> 00:27:45.205
How could you hand the script
to another director

00:27:45.705 --> 00:27:47.749
without even consulting me?

00:27:48.333 --> 00:27:50.418
How could I when I knew
you'd react like this?

00:27:50.502 --> 00:27:53.880
And why would Director Ju
be considered a rookie?

00:27:55.090 --> 00:27:58.176
He's an experienced director
who has a debut feature.

00:27:58.259 --> 00:27:59.886
And what, "box office hits"?

00:27:59.969 --> 00:28:02.222
Director Gyeong's never had
a box office hit!

00:28:02.305 --> 00:28:05.141
But actors love Director Gyeong.

00:28:06.267 --> 00:28:07.894
Who do you think suggested him?

00:28:08.478 --> 00:28:09.646
It was Lee Seung-jae.

00:28:10.230 --> 00:28:13.525
Just tell him we'll give him full credit
for Good Man's script.

00:28:13.608 --> 00:28:16.653
Then offer him Young Hearts.
You initially wanted him to--

00:28:16.736 --> 00:28:20.365
I will address this personally
with the boss.

00:28:21.241 --> 00:28:22.075
Producer Ryu.

00:28:22.951 --> 00:28:23.993
Ryu Eun-jung.

00:28:24.869 --> 00:28:28.123
Let's face it. We can't afford
to turn down Gyeong Seung-ju.

00:28:29.165 --> 00:28:32.794
This is our team's first
investment opportunity in three years.

00:28:32.877 --> 00:28:36.256
This isn't just about Good Man.
Our team's at stake.

00:28:38.466 --> 00:28:39.426
Lose the attitude,

00:28:40.885 --> 00:28:42.095
and deal with Director Ju.

00:29:03.116 --> 00:29:05.201
What's up? Why's it so tense here?

00:29:07.078 --> 00:29:08.663
What's this about Gyeong Seung-ju?

00:29:09.873 --> 00:29:10.999
-Do you know?
-Hush.

00:29:11.082 --> 00:29:12.584
Come on, what is it?

00:29:14.043 --> 00:29:15.587
Why are you hushing me?

00:29:19.382 --> 00:29:20.467
FROM DIRECTOR JU DONG-HYANG

00:29:20.550 --> 00:29:21.801
How did the meeting go?

00:29:26.639 --> 00:29:28.099
The contract has no clause

00:29:28.183 --> 00:29:31.394
that guarantees Director Ju
a priority claim.

00:29:33.354 --> 00:29:36.024
I would have insisted on it
if I'd seen this coming.

00:29:36.107 --> 00:29:37.484
Like that would've worked.

00:29:38.109 --> 00:29:40.653
JD never adds such clauses
for rookie directors.

00:29:40.737 --> 00:29:42.864
What angers me most

00:29:43.531 --> 00:29:47.118
is that I encouraged him
to sign such a contract.

00:29:49.871 --> 00:29:51.748
What did you tell Director Ju?

00:29:52.457 --> 00:29:54.375
I told him the review went well

00:29:55.126 --> 00:29:57.629
and that I'll share the details
in person tomorrow.

00:29:59.798 --> 00:30:01.883
The film industry sure is cruel.

00:30:39.087 --> 00:30:40.255
When's the meeting?

00:30:41.756 --> 00:30:42.882
At eleven o'clock.

00:30:43.383 --> 00:30:45.093
When you meet Director Ju,

00:30:45.176 --> 00:30:47.262
don't tell him
Gyeong Seung-ju got the job.

00:30:48.388 --> 00:30:50.056
How could I not?

00:30:50.139 --> 00:30:54.269
He'll find out sooner or later.
I have to be the one to tell him.

00:30:54.352 --> 00:30:57.272
You might believe
that honesty is the best policy,

00:30:57.355 --> 00:30:59.399
but it isn't
if you're on the receiving end.

00:30:59.482 --> 00:31:01.234
It's the least you can do.

00:31:01.734 --> 00:31:03.611
He'd be mortified if he knew

00:31:03.695 --> 00:31:06.656
that Gyeong Seung-ju
was contacted behind his back.

00:31:06.739 --> 00:31:08.366
But still…

00:31:08.449 --> 00:31:09.826
Do as I say.

00:31:10.326 --> 00:31:12.579
In this case,
being honest would be selfish.

00:31:20.169 --> 00:31:23.298
It's Mr. Jeong.
He wants me in the division head's office.

00:31:26.926 --> 00:31:28.595
Come take a seat.

00:31:39.105 --> 00:31:40.023
Ryu Eun-jung.

00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:43.276
Do you two know each other?

00:31:52.201 --> 00:31:53.953
We're childhood friends.

00:31:58.833 --> 00:31:59.667
Is that true?

00:32:00.627 --> 00:32:01.794
I never knew.

00:32:02.921 --> 00:32:05.673
Why are you standing there?
Take a seat, Producer Ryu.

00:32:18.728 --> 00:32:21.189
So you two are friends? How convenient.

00:32:24.901 --> 00:32:27.820
Producer Cheon Sang-yeon
will join you as of today.

00:32:32.158 --> 00:32:34.243
What do you mean by "join"?

00:32:35.411 --> 00:32:36.704
Exactly as it sounds.

00:32:36.788 --> 00:32:38.915
She'll be co-producing Good Man.

00:32:44.504 --> 00:32:46.130
Co-producing?

00:32:55.181 --> 00:32:56.683
Can you give us a minute?

00:32:59.227 --> 00:33:02.897
Producer Cheon,
you probably haven't even seen your desk.

00:33:02.981 --> 00:33:04.816
Will you step out for a minute?

00:33:05.483 --> 00:33:07.151
I'll show you to it.

00:33:07.652 --> 00:33:08.486
This way.

00:33:11.572 --> 00:33:12.699
Over there…

00:33:16.202 --> 00:33:18.871
Can I please have an explanation?

00:33:20.915 --> 00:33:23.751
Producer Cheon
joining as executive producer

00:33:23.835 --> 00:33:26.045
is Director Gyeong's first condition.

00:33:27.255 --> 00:33:28.423
Executive producer?

00:33:28.506 --> 00:33:31.759
But Mr. Hwang here shut him down
and said that won't fly.

00:33:32.510 --> 00:33:35.054
You should thank him for having your back.

00:33:35.555 --> 00:33:38.182
You'll be co-producing,
so nothing will change for you.

00:33:39.058 --> 00:33:41.436
So it's already decided. I understand.

00:33:41.519 --> 00:33:43.688
Producer Ryu, come on now…

00:33:44.313 --> 00:33:45.398
Producer Ryu.

00:33:54.490 --> 00:33:57.452
Producer Cheon
joining as executive producer

00:33:57.535 --> 00:33:59.662
is Director Gyeong's first condition.

00:34:10.757 --> 00:34:13.134
I'm meeting Director Ju in half an hour.

00:34:13.676 --> 00:34:17.096
If he agrees to do Young Hearts,
you must give him a director's contract.

00:34:17.597 --> 00:34:19.223
Not an incremental contract

00:34:19.307 --> 00:34:21.893
but a full one with incentive clauses.

00:34:21.976 --> 00:34:23.352
Along with his assistants.

00:34:25.730 --> 00:34:27.648
Sure. Well done for coming around.

00:34:28.149 --> 00:34:30.193
Obviously, I intended to offer him--

00:34:30.276 --> 00:34:31.778
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

00:34:33.279 --> 00:34:36.491
-What is this?
-Remember what you told me when I started?

00:34:37.533 --> 00:34:39.535
"As producers, it's all about the people."

00:34:40.745 --> 00:34:42.163
"People are our pulse."

00:34:48.002 --> 00:34:48.920
Producer Ryu.

00:34:53.925 --> 00:34:54.926
I'm sorry.

00:34:55.426 --> 00:34:59.472
After years in the industry,
I thought I'd experienced it all.

00:35:00.139 --> 00:35:02.183
But JD is truly something else.

00:35:03.434 --> 00:35:04.727
I am so sorry.

00:35:06.437 --> 00:35:08.064
I have no words.

00:35:10.024 --> 00:35:13.820
If I return the funds I received,
can you get me back my script?

00:35:15.947 --> 00:35:17.365
You know the answer to that.

00:35:17.865 --> 00:35:19.283
Due to the source material,

00:35:20.201 --> 00:35:22.954
retrieving the script
won't grant you usage rights.

00:35:24.163 --> 00:35:27.291
Is Mr. Jeong at the office?
How dare they treat creatives like shit--

00:35:27.375 --> 00:35:28.417
Director Ju.

00:35:29.001 --> 00:35:32.421
Please listen to everything
I have to say before you leave.

00:35:32.922 --> 00:35:34.423
I won't stop you.

00:35:34.924 --> 00:35:37.802
Go grab Mr. Jeong by the collar
or tear the company down.

00:35:37.885 --> 00:35:39.762
Please just hear me out first.

00:35:47.311 --> 00:35:50.231
So who is this brilliant director
they've chosen instead?

00:35:55.111 --> 00:35:56.154
Director Ju.

00:35:59.574 --> 00:36:02.451
I know you can't consider
anything else right now, but…

00:36:07.498 --> 00:36:08.541
Good Man…

00:36:11.544 --> 00:36:13.796
Forget all about it and do Young Hearts.

00:36:14.714 --> 00:36:15.673
Hold on.

00:36:15.756 --> 00:36:18.384
Did I hear you correctly?
This is not about getting--

00:36:18.467 --> 00:36:19.677
I get it.

00:36:20.511 --> 00:36:21.804
You must be devastated.

00:36:22.722 --> 00:36:23.931
But still,

00:36:24.891 --> 00:36:27.059
I have to tell you this today.

00:36:31.189 --> 00:36:33.191
If you go on to sign another contract,

00:36:34.817 --> 00:36:37.111
they probably won't raise
your director's fee.

00:36:37.695 --> 00:36:41.365
So I suggest
you ask for 60 million for the script.

00:36:42.241 --> 00:36:44.076
They will counter with 50 million.

00:36:47.205 --> 00:36:50.082
Yes, I resigned from JD.

00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:53.127
Wait, why would you?

00:36:54.128 --> 00:36:55.588
I can't do this anymore.

00:36:57.840 --> 00:36:58.841
As for the incentive--

00:36:58.925 --> 00:37:01.177
Why are you the one quitting?

00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:02.970
They're the ones who've done wrong.

00:37:03.054 --> 00:37:04.555
I wrote that contract.

00:37:04.639 --> 00:37:06.474
Seriously, that's enough!

00:37:06.557 --> 00:37:08.976
I won't let Mr. Jeong get away with this.

00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:24.784
PRODUCER OH HUI-JIN

00:38:04.532 --> 00:38:05.908
At least eat something.

00:38:07.743 --> 00:38:10.329
Good heavens. You sure drank a lot.

00:38:10.413 --> 00:38:11.747
Did you call the office?

00:38:12.999 --> 00:38:15.209
I took the day off.

00:38:15.876 --> 00:38:17.044
My goodness.

00:38:21.841 --> 00:38:24.218
I felt an overwhelming sense of despair.

00:38:26.262 --> 00:38:29.223
I was worried about money, unemployment,

00:38:30.141 --> 00:38:31.809
and my future.

00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:35.563
Even so,

00:38:37.064 --> 00:38:39.191
I had no desire to go back there.

00:38:39.275 --> 00:38:40.943
I guess you've come back to life.

00:38:44.447 --> 00:38:46.157
People don't die so easily.

00:38:55.875 --> 00:38:57.001
Who is it?

00:38:57.084 --> 00:38:57.960
It's me!

00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:00.755
Who?

00:39:02.548 --> 00:39:04.216
Oh my, Sang-yeon!

00:39:04.300 --> 00:39:06.552
Oh my word! How long has it been?

00:39:06.635 --> 00:39:08.179
Eun-jung, it's Sang-yeon!

00:39:08.262 --> 00:39:09.096
How are you?

00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:10.431
Good, of course.

00:39:11.349 --> 00:39:12.725
Oh, you shouldn't have!

00:39:12.808 --> 00:39:13.642
It's heavy.

00:39:14.143 --> 00:39:15.311
Ow, my back.

00:39:15.394 --> 00:39:17.855
You haven't had dinner, have you? Come in.

00:39:18.356 --> 00:39:19.398
Let's talk outside.

00:39:20.232 --> 00:39:23.319
I actually have something to discuss
with Eun-jung.

00:39:23.944 --> 00:39:25.529
-Take care.
-Sure, okay.

00:39:25.613 --> 00:39:27.782
-I'll visit you again soon.
-You do that.

00:39:27.865 --> 00:39:28.991
Good night.

00:39:37.041 --> 00:39:39.418
Do you feel better now that you've quit?

00:39:42.046 --> 00:39:44.757
I really wasn't aware
that this was your project.

00:39:45.466 --> 00:39:48.594
I thought everything
had been confirmed internally.

00:39:50.846 --> 00:39:53.265
If you ask me
whether I cared enough to ask

00:39:53.349 --> 00:39:57.061
how things were left with Director Ju,
who was originally attached to the movie,

00:39:58.229 --> 00:39:59.647
I have nothing to say.

00:40:01.482 --> 00:40:02.858
I've been pretty shameless.

00:40:03.567 --> 00:40:05.361
If you know, finish your food and go.

00:40:11.617 --> 00:40:12.451
Come back.

00:40:15.454 --> 00:40:18.040
I heard you abandoned
all your other projects too.

00:40:18.916 --> 00:40:22.962
You're not working with Director Ju
elsewhere. Why ditch your other projects?

00:40:26.257 --> 00:40:29.844
Is this like when you kept sending me
rent money back then?

00:40:36.976 --> 00:40:38.102
Spare me the mockery.

00:40:38.185 --> 00:40:39.812
I just can't understand you.

00:40:39.895 --> 00:40:41.480
And you never will.

00:40:48.028 --> 00:40:49.280
I guess you're right.

00:40:51.699 --> 00:40:55.077
The point is, I don't want to
take someone's spot like this.

00:40:55.161 --> 00:40:58.122
If you simply can't bear it,
be the executive producer.

00:40:58.205 --> 00:40:59.248
I'll support you.

00:41:03.711 --> 00:41:05.713
Do you even know that my mom died?

00:41:10.050 --> 00:41:10.885
What?

00:41:15.097 --> 00:41:16.056
She died.

00:41:30.779 --> 00:41:31.780
Ms. Yoon

00:41:33.365 --> 00:41:34.408
passed away?

00:41:38.454 --> 00:41:40.331
Sit down if you want to hear more.

00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:50.174
When?

00:41:52.134 --> 00:41:53.344
Why didn't you tell me?

00:41:54.011 --> 00:41:55.429
I tried to.

00:41:57.556 --> 00:41:59.475
But you didn't answer my call.

00:42:01.727 --> 00:42:02.978
When?

00:42:03.479 --> 00:42:05.523
When did you ever call me?

00:42:06.065 --> 00:42:08.734
Before the last time we met.

00:42:14.740 --> 00:42:18.244
The doctor said
she only had three months left,

00:42:18.953 --> 00:42:21.080
so I called you,
thinking she'd want to see

00:42:22.831 --> 00:42:24.959
her favorite student one last time.

00:42:29.547 --> 00:42:30.881
But you ignored my call.

00:42:34.093 --> 00:42:35.135
I did?

00:42:37.638 --> 00:42:38.931
Yes, you did.

00:42:41.058 --> 00:42:43.227
She didn't even last three months.

00:42:50.734 --> 00:42:53.529
Why are you always so predictable?

00:42:54.405 --> 00:42:58.492
Can't you see I'm using my mom
to make you reconsider?

00:42:58.576 --> 00:43:01.161
You still should have called me.

00:43:08.210 --> 00:43:09.420
I didn't want to.

00:43:13.549 --> 00:43:15.926
Do you think
I would've wanted to contact you then?

00:43:19.138 --> 00:43:20.598
How did you handle the funeral?

00:43:20.681 --> 00:43:21.515
There wasn't one.

00:43:25.978 --> 00:43:28.230
I just scattered her ashes in the sea.

00:43:32.192 --> 00:43:33.736
You did cross my mind,

00:43:34.945 --> 00:43:39.908
but it irritated me
that I was thinking about you.

00:43:41.327 --> 00:43:42.828
So you scattered her ashes alone?

00:43:43.704 --> 00:43:46.165
-Who else would I do it with?
-How can you be so--

00:43:46.749 --> 00:43:48.584
Since I'm using my mom,

00:43:49.627 --> 00:43:51.086
let me make it worthwhile.

00:43:53.088 --> 00:43:53.964
Come back.

00:43:57.718 --> 00:43:59.720
I'm not doing this for your sake.

00:44:02.014 --> 00:44:04.516
Your colleagues
won't even look me in the eye.

00:44:05.017 --> 00:44:07.394
I know nothing about the company system,

00:44:07.478 --> 00:44:09.647
and I'm being treated like an intruder.

00:44:11.023 --> 00:44:14.234
Most importantly,
once Director Gyeong gets involved,

00:44:14.318 --> 00:44:16.737
he'll tear into the script
with his red pen.

00:44:17.738 --> 00:44:20.199
You should defend the script's integrity.

00:44:22.117 --> 00:44:24.912
Because I'll likely side
with Gyeong Seung-ju.

00:44:34.296 --> 00:44:38.342
Can't you see I'm using my mom
to make you reconsider?

00:44:40.761 --> 00:44:43.972
Sang-yeon said she was using her mom.

00:44:46.266 --> 00:44:47.101
Come back.

00:44:50.187 --> 00:44:51.814
I received the deposit,

00:44:51.897 --> 00:44:53.899
but something urgent came up.

00:44:55.359 --> 00:44:58.070
Sorry I used some
without discussing it with you.

00:44:59.446 --> 00:45:01.156
I called you to tell you this.

00:45:02.825 --> 00:45:06.203
The urgent thing
you used the deposit for back then,

00:45:07.121 --> 00:45:08.831
was it your mom's medical bills?

00:45:12.334 --> 00:45:13.168
Yes.

00:45:20.884 --> 00:45:22.594
Yet you still went out of your way…

00:45:24.471 --> 00:45:26.181
to pay me back?

00:45:30.436 --> 00:45:31.270
Yes.

00:45:34.314 --> 00:45:35.774
How could you?

00:45:38.277 --> 00:45:39.236
Your mom was dying.

00:45:39.319 --> 00:45:40.279
That's just…

00:45:42.906 --> 00:45:43.741
me.

00:45:46.869 --> 00:45:48.412
You could never understand.

00:46:01.508 --> 00:46:03.343
Man, this punk.

00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:15.314
Producer Ryu.

00:46:15.397 --> 00:46:17.649
-You owe me an apology.
-What?

00:46:17.733 --> 00:46:20.152
Were you frustrated
that I ignored your calls?

00:46:21.320 --> 00:46:23.530
Everyone has feelings, after all.

00:46:27.534 --> 00:46:28.535
Yes, okay.

00:46:29.328 --> 00:46:31.955
I admit I was a little too careless.

00:46:32.456 --> 00:46:33.707
I'm really sorry.

00:46:33.791 --> 00:46:35.501
Please call over Producer Cheon.

00:46:41.340 --> 00:46:42.299
Producer Cheon.

00:46:50.766 --> 00:46:52.351
You heard, didn't you?

00:46:53.268 --> 00:46:56.939
Producer Cheon has decided to let you
take the executive producer role.

00:47:02.653 --> 00:47:06.114
Did you say that you would let me
be the executive producer?

00:47:11.662 --> 00:47:13.539
Technically, I'm not letting you.

00:47:14.832 --> 00:47:18.168
It was your role to start with,
so I'm not letting you be anything.

00:47:19.211 --> 00:47:21.672
I merely said that if you can't accept me,

00:47:21.755 --> 00:47:25.843
I would meet you halfway and support you.
Isn't that right, Mr. Jeong?

00:47:28.345 --> 00:47:30.556
Yes, that's what I meant.

00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:36.395
Allow me to demonstrate
what meeting halfway looks like.

00:47:37.563 --> 00:47:40.232
I'll co-produce with Producer Cheon.

00:47:40.732 --> 00:47:42.442
We'll co-produce Good Man.

00:47:45.404 --> 00:47:47.155
You said you were using your mom…

00:47:47.239 --> 00:47:49.783
Let's give it our best shot,
Producer Cheon.

00:47:50.868 --> 00:47:52.369
…but it won't work on me.

00:47:54.162 --> 00:47:55.914
I choose to take your hand

00:47:57.499 --> 00:47:59.209
solely for me and my work.

00:48:00.961 --> 00:48:04.089
Because now you mean nothing to me.

00:51:29.795 --> 00:51:34.800
