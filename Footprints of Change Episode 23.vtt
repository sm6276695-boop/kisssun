00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:43.850
[Episode 23]

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.930
Alright.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.759
Your room is so small.

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.229
There's not even a place
to hang clothes to dry.

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:50.759
There is.

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.440
I just hang them on that rack.

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:56.789
It's still wet.

00:01:57.229 --> 00:01:58.950
Shanghai's so damp.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.150
I'm telling you...

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:01.150
It's soaking wet.

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.120
It'll take a week to dry.

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.480
And it'll probably get moldy.

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.450
Professor Xiang Beichuan,

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.630
isn't it a little inappropriate to go out

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:10.630
in moldy clothes?

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:11.910
It's not that bad.

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.440
As long as it's not the rainy season,
it's fine.

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.079
Don't make it hard on yourself.

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:18.750
I have a washing machine in my room.

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:19.630
A twin-tub.

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:20.940
It's very special.

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.400
It's the only one in the building.

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.690
The left tub washes,

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.130
and the right tub spins dry.

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:26.820
The spin dryer is unique.

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.790
You've never heard that sound, have you?

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:29.420
No.

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.750
Once it starts,

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:32.500
it's like...

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:35.770
It's insanely loud.

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.200
Really noisy.

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.600
What's good about being noisy?

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.860
You can come over at night from now on.

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.800
Every night, Jiuling

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.310
listens to storytelling

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:47.800
at the same time.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.630
And not just that—
she also listens to comic duets.

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:50.710
So come at night.

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:51.910
Make some noise

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:53.560
and help me get even.

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.880
As long as Jiuling thinks it's okay.

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.000
I think it's okay.

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.910
It's settled then.

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.060
You'll do your laundry
at my place at night.

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.920
And if I get hungry,
I'll come here for some noodles.

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:23.890
I bet every woman in this building,

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:26.860
smelling your cooking

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:28.590
with the door open,

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:30.240
wants to come by at night

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:31.460
to get a free meal.

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:33.800
Of course not.

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.079
Then how did I get in?

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:41.120
You like me?

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:45.480
Miss Ye...

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:47.610
Our relationship...

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:48.940
Why are you stuttering?

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:50.500
Why are you so nervous?

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:51.750
You really do like me?

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:52.430
I...

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:53.470
I don't like you.

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:54.150
And I'm not nervous.

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.910
I'm not...

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.190
Why did you take it seriously?

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:58.710
I was just kidding.

00:03:58.730 --> 00:03:59.790
You dummy.

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:03.330
That's a good one.

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:05.030
What's a good one?

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:07.080
From now on,

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:08.090
I'll call you

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.740
"Dummy."

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:19.480
I'm sorry.

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:21.920
Dummy, where are you going?

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:30.980
Professor Xiang,

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:32.590
are you mad?

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.870
No.

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:36.970
I'm going to the bathroom.

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:48.070
Miss Ye,

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:50.130
you just got a call.

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:51.050
Who was it?

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.159
I don't know. Someone named Li.

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:01.730
Mr. Li?

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:04.310
Sorry, I missed your call.

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.870
Ye,

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:09.270
I have to say,

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:12.240
your craftsmanship and your efforts

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:13.800
have convinced me.

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.750
So now,

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:16.270
take me to your factory

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:17.750
for a visit.

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:18.750
We can consider

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:20.630
discussing further cooperation.

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:21.240
Now?

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.100
Okay, I'll arrange it right away.

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:24.360
See you at the factory.

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:25.310
I'll go there right now.

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:25.840
Alright.

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:26.830
It's settled then.

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:27.430
See you soon.

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:28.390
Alright!

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:30.290
What's going on?

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:31.510
Nothing.

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:33.409
I'm about to make a fortune.

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:34.650
Fortune? What fortune?

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:35.650
Tell me about it.

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:36.870
How big is this fortune?

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:37.870
Is there a share for me?

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:38.430
No.

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:39.240
Jiuling, stop messing around.

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:40.070
Let go of me.

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:42.520
There's no share for me?

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:46.950
Ye,

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:48.240
not bad.

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:50.630
I'm very satisfied

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:51.600
with your technology

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:52.480
and equipment.

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:53.800
They really can meet

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:56.159
the production requirements
for this batch.

00:05:56.159 --> 00:05:58.070
Mr. Li, you're a veteran in this industry.

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:59.310
You can see the standard of our technology

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:00.430
and equipment at a glance.

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:03.160
We certainly can't fake anything
in front of you.

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:04.310
Ye,

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:07.420
I'm very pleased
with your entrepreneurial attitude,

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:09.750
but let's be upfront:

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:11.630
our standards

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:13.910
for quality and delivery times are high.

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:15.980
If you fail to meet them this time,

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:18.430
I'll demand liquidated damages.

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:19.510
No problem.

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:20.780
You giving us this opportunity

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:22.750
is the greatest show of trust and support—

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:23.410
we'll deliver

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:25.670
on quality and quantity.

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:26.550
All right.

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:30.510
Here's the contract.

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:31.070
Thank you.

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:32.110
Here's the contract.

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:33.550
Take it back and look it over carefully.

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:34.490
If there are no issues,

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:35.920
sign it and bring it back to me.

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:36.600
Okay.

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:39.750
Sir, your car is here.

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:40.720
Okay.

00:06:42.159 --> 00:06:42.870
Ye,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.040
keep it up.

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:46.310
If you can make these 5,000 pairs of jeans

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:48.830
on time and to spec,

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:51.940
I'll consider a long-term partnership.

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:53.830
Thank you so much, Mr. Li.

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:55.190
We won't

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:56.360
let you down.

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:57.000
Okay.

00:06:57.750 --> 00:06:58.610
Let me see you out.

00:06:58.610 --> 00:06:59.040
Okay.

00:06:59.040 --> 00:06:59.750
This way.

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:04.300
She definitely won't make the deal.

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:05.310
[Employment Agreement]

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:07.360
Don't think she can easily close deals

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:09.620
just because she's young and beautiful.

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:11.480
This isn't something

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:12.630
that can be settled

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:13.770
with just casual talk.

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:15.000
She's just a young girl.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.430
I just don't believe it.

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:18.810
If you gave me this task,

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:20.630
I definitely couldn't pull it off.

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:22.070
But I'm not one to brag.

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:24.190
I'm just, you know...

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:26.360
steady, hardworking, and diligent.

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:27.160
Right?

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:29.390
You're saying she's deceiving me?

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:30.870
Absolutely.

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:34.480
She is a bit young

00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:37.190
for handling such a big deal.

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:39.450
How about this?

00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:41.510
I'll tear up this contract right now.

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:43.700
Don't be upset, okay?

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:46.390
Miss Ye.

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:47.600
How did it go?

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:49.280
I got the deal.

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:50.800
You got the deal?

00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:54.650
Miss Ye, your abilities and connections

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:56.000
are truly impressive.

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:57.830
The deal is secured,

00:07:57.950 --> 00:07:59.590
but completing the order

00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:01.000
will be up to you, Mr. Lu.

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:02.520
That's no problem at all.

00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:04.510
Our production and technology

00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:06.310
are what we're most confident in.

00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:07.070
Don't worry.

00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:08.910
Our workers are all skilled.

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:10.600
Then please stamp it for me.

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:11.360
Sure.

00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:16.760
This is the employment agreement.

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:19.360
Miss Ye,

00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:20.950
our company is small.

00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:22.680
You're a talent too good for us.

00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:24.310
Take a look at the agreement.

00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:26.540
If you have any requests,
feel free to let us know,

00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:28.620
and we'll do our best to accommodate you

00:08:55.550 --> 00:08:57.360
You should care for

You have a bad temper.

00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:02.390
You must be more considerate of her.

00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:03.240
Got it?

Did you hear me?

Miss Ye,

You can really achieve great things.

You've only been here a few days

completely infatuated with you.

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:42.960

I'm telling the truth.

Jiuling,

00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:10.200
no wonder Mr. Lu said
the company is small.

00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:12.150
Turns out it's being held back

00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:13.410
by employees like you.

This contract has a penalty clause,

I do.

You trust us so much.

00:10:34.630 --> 00:10:37.670
We completely understand
the need for a penalty clause.

00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:38.240
Good.

and make a few more pairs of jeans

00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:06.750

Mr. Lu gave it to me?

00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:21.240
Of course.

You just got here,

00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:24.360
and Mr. Lu already gave you
a 20,000-yuan commission.

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:25.080
I've been here for years

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:26.870
and have never seen a commission this big.

00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:28.400
How do you know it's 20,000?

00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:29.360
I don't.

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:30.240
You opened it?

No, I didn't.

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:32.330
Then how do you know it's 20,000?

00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:33.100
I don't know.

please don't snoop through my things.

00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:42.870
That's because Mr. Lu
asked me to give it to you.

00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:45.730
Otherwise,
I wouldn't bother touching your stuff.

I'm not.

00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:54.200
Do you talk to everyone
with this attitude?

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:54.840
No,

00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:56.330

and buy tons of new clothes

00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:08.480
and eat so much delicious food.

Jiuling, do you want to come with me?

00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:12.270
I can't eat all that food by myself.

Who wants to go with you?

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:14.500
Go eat by yourself.

00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:17.140
As if I care about your food.

00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:20.540

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:34.880
How about I
go to the mall with you tomorrow?

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:37.700
I can help you pick.

I'm not.

There's a cockroach in my room.

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:17.790
You can't just squash it,

00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:19.000
or there'll be more.

00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:21.060
You can only kill it with boiling water.

I'll help you.

00:13:21.930 --> 00:13:22.680

and kill it with it when I get back.

Do people at your company
usually stay so late after work?

00:13:31.510 --> 00:13:32.200
No.

00:13:32.470 --> 00:13:33.750

and stay here at night.

I didn't know that.

Why do you live here?

get a new business opportunity, right?

00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:47.030
I just introduced a connection.

00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:49.320
The main reason
is that Mr. Lu's materials are good

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:50.170
and the technology is solid.

00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:50.600
Yes.

00:13:51.390 --> 00:13:54.250
Mr. Lu's factory
really does have good technology.

No, thanks.

00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:17.030
I need to go back to kill the cockroach.

Don't point the fan at me!

00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:35.080
It's oscillating. Can't you see?

00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:36.140
It's blowing on me.

00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:39.150
What's wrong with you?

00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:41.200
The raw materials have gone up in price.

What do you mean?

00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:43.480
Literally!

00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:45.730
The raw materials have gone up by 40%!

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:46.870
That much?

Nothing to do with you?

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:52.910
You're in charge of raw materials—
how can it have nothing to do with you?

00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:53.750
What else can I do?

You're responsible

Yes, you're better than me.

Don't insult me like that,

00:15:24.910 --> 00:15:25.750
I'm letting you, Ye Xining.

00:15:25.750 --> 00:15:26.670
Well, look at this.

00:15:26.670 --> 00:15:28.840
We're short 120,000 now.
What should we do?

00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:30.390
If Mr. Lu finds out
and holds us accountable,

00:15:30.390 --> 00:15:31.200
would you be nervous?

00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:32.030
Why would I be nervous?

00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:32.750
Why?

00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:34.030
It wasn't me who raised the price.

00:15:34.030 --> 00:15:35.440
Keep playing tough.

00:15:50.390 --> 00:15:52.200
If I try to negotiate

00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:53.870
and resolve this 120,000 yuan problem
for you,

00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:54.800
what will you do?

00:15:56.070 --> 00:15:57.130
I'll kowtow to you.

00:15:57.150 --> 00:15:58.240
Fine. Where?

00:15:58.240 --> 00:15:58.960
You pick the place.

00:15:58.960 --> 00:15:59.600
Just in the hallway.

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:00.280
Fine!

00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:01.110
Go ahead!

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:02.000
If you really succeed,

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:03.270
I'll kowtow to you at the Bund.

00:16:03.270 --> 00:16:03.810
Are you serious?

00:16:03.810 --> 00:16:04.730
I am!

00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:05.750
Go now!

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:07.040
Why are you shouting?

00:16:07.790 --> 00:16:08.550
It's so hot today.

00:16:08.550 --> 00:16:10.240
Who turned off the fan?

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:11.150
Wasn't it you who turned it off?

00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:11.910
I don't know.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.460
You're so out of your mind.

00:16:17.750 --> 00:16:18.550
Dummy.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:20.790
Miss Ye.

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:22.550
Open a soda for me.

00:16:23.690 --> 00:16:24.520
You're here to...

00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:25.510
I'm not here for you.

00:16:25.510 --> 00:16:26.750
I'm looking for Mr. Yan.

00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:27.480
Where is he?

00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:31.580
Mr. Yan's been quite busy lately.

00:16:32.430 --> 00:16:33.750
He might be feeling unwell

00:16:33.750 --> 00:16:35.020
and went to the restroom.

00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:36.160
Now every morning
when he comes to the office,

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:37.990
the first thing he does
is go to the restroom.

00:16:37.990 --> 00:16:39.080
Please wait a moment.

00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:40.210
He'll be right back.

00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:42.380
Don't stand there.

00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:45.080
Sit down and chat with me for a while.

00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:54.670
Miss Ye, you're here.

00:16:54.670 --> 00:16:55.080
Mr. Yan.

00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:56.000
Hello.

00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:57.400
Please have a seat.

00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:02.610
What are you talking about?

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:05.920
Miss Ye is here to see you.

00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:08.440
I told Miss Ye
that you went to the restroom.

00:17:08.589 --> 00:17:09.640
You've probably
had too many social obligations lately

00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:11.069
and your stomach feels a bit off.

00:17:11.069 --> 00:17:11.510
Every day at work...

00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:12.069
No, no.

00:17:12.069 --> 00:17:12.730
Wait, wait.

00:17:13.310 --> 00:17:13.920
Beichuan,

00:17:14.550 --> 00:17:16.400
in the future, don't make assumptions

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:18.400
about things you don't understand.

00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:20.720
Miss Ye, what brings you here today?

00:17:21.310 --> 00:17:22.109
Mr. Yan,

00:17:22.190 --> 00:17:23.670
last time you mentioned

00:17:23.790 --> 00:17:26.720
you wanted to invest in our business
and take a share.

00:17:26.829 --> 00:17:28.200
I'm here to ask

00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:30.010
if you are serious.

00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:31.270
Of course I am.

00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:33.790
Dummy.

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:37.550
Mr. Yan said
he wants to invest in our company.

00:17:37.770 --> 00:17:39.620
Is he really serious about that?

00:17:40.790 --> 00:17:41.590
Miss Ye,

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.830
when it comes to business,

00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:45.270
you can trust Mr. Yan.

00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:46.530
He's very good at it.

00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:49.900
Then we can have a proper talk about this.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:52.750
Miss Ye,

00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:55.370
you're showing some favoritism here.

00:17:56.310 --> 00:17:57.790
Beichuan and I knew you

00:17:57.790 --> 00:17:59.050
at about the same time.

00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:00.310
Why do you

00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:01.830
trust him

00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:03.350
but not me?

00:18:04.830 --> 00:18:05.830
No, that's not it.

00:18:09.550 --> 00:18:11.400
Is it because he's a bit silly?

00:18:12.210 --> 00:18:13.450
That's really not it.

00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:16.380
Then why?

00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:24.750
We're getting off-topic.

00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:26.750
Let's get down to business, Mr. Yan.

00:18:27.070 --> 00:18:28.440
Fine, let's talk business.

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:29.290
I know

00:18:29.790 --> 00:18:31.200
your company now has

00:18:31.650 --> 00:18:32.510
the technology

00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:33.840
and the connections,

00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:35.750
but what you lack is funding.

00:18:36.070 --> 00:18:38.130
So exactly how much money do you need?

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:40.920
Mr. Yan,

00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:43.030
our company

00:18:43.030 --> 00:18:44.290
doesn't lack funding.

00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:47.270
We just want
to take this great opportunity

00:18:47.550 --> 00:18:49.440
to find and bring in

00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:51.390
outstanding partners like you.

00:18:51.970 --> 00:18:53.830
Look how great this opportunity is.

00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:54.830
As far as I know,

00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:57.380
our company still has
a 120,000-yuan share.

00:18:57.510 --> 00:19:00.590
That's quite a bit,
but also not that much.

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:03.590
Let's see if you can get in.

00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:05.590
I can try

00:19:05.610 --> 00:19:06.640
to help you

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:08.160
get a 24% share,

00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:09.790
maybe even more.

00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:13.030
But I need to discuss this

00:19:13.030 --> 00:19:14.200
with Mr. Lu

00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:15.910
to see if there's room for it.

00:19:16.110 --> 00:19:17.200
What do you think?

00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:22.590
No problem.

00:19:23.110 --> 00:19:24.110
No problem at all.

00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:25.890
So today we can consider

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.830
that we've reached
a preliminary agreement.

00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:28.960
Next,

00:19:29.450 --> 00:19:30.560
I'll personally

00:19:30.590 --> 00:19:32.290
communicate with you about this,

00:19:32.290 --> 00:19:33.490
step by step, okay?

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:34.680
That won't be necessary.

00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:37.410
You can have one of your staff
coordinate with me.

00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:39.640
My staff...

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:40.830
Well...

00:19:40.830 --> 00:19:41.630
Liu, perhaps.

00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:42.440
He's not here today,

00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:44.590
but he's very familiar with this area.

00:19:44.670 --> 00:19:45.950
Who is Liu?

00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:47.440
I'm not familiar with him.

00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:49.410
How about you choose someone else?

00:19:54.310 --> 00:19:55.160
Well, then...

00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:55.800
Beichuan.

00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:56.750
You...

00:19:56.750 --> 00:19:57.720
You'll communicate these matters

00:19:57.720 --> 00:19:59.270
with Miss Ye from now on.

00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:05.060
Didn't you say I'm a bit silly?

00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:06.160
You're silly,

00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:08.160
but you can learn from Miss Ye.

00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:10.690
Miss Ye, please guide him a bit.

00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:14.440
Well...

00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:15.640
Miss Ye,

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:17.480
I might need to...

00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:17.990
I'm sorry.

00:20:17.990 --> 00:20:18.920
It's fine.

00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:20.540
You two keep talking.

00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:21.270
Excuse me.

00:20:21.270 --> 00:20:21.880
Please, go ahead.

00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:22.550
Sorry.

00:20:39.790 --> 00:20:42.000
Will there be any issues with Yan Jun?

00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:43.790
I've known him for two years.

00:20:44.030 --> 00:20:45.600
His business is quite big,

00:20:46.110 --> 00:20:48.350
but he's done
quite a few shady things too.

00:20:48.350 --> 00:20:49.810
It shouldn't be a problem.

00:20:50.030 --> 00:20:52.110
He just asked me
to draft a contract for him.

00:20:52.110 --> 00:20:52.720
Okay.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:54.960
Make sure to check the contract carefully.

00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:56.550
We can't let Yan Jun deceive us.

00:20:56.550 --> 00:20:57.750
Okay, Mr. Lu.

00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:00.440
Where's Jiuling?

00:21:01.030 --> 00:21:02.490
She went to find the place.

00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:03.640
To do what?

00:21:04.790 --> 00:21:05.550
To kowtow.

00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:08.750
I haven't heard of anything going on

00:21:08.750 --> 00:21:10.160
with her family lately.

00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:18.290
The factory produced 1000 pairs of jeans.

00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:20.610
Later, you guys

00:21:20.750 --> 00:21:21.480
make a trip

00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:23.230
and take them to the dock.

00:21:24.110 --> 00:21:24.920
Also,

00:21:25.070 --> 00:21:26.270
didn't Yan Jun

00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:27.880
invest in us?

00:21:28.590 --> 00:21:30.220
Xiang Beichuan from his company

00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:31.260
will go with you.

00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:34.270
I won't be going.

00:21:34.270 --> 00:21:35.270
You're not going?

00:21:35.790 --> 00:21:37.240
I have some urgent matters

00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:38.240
to handle today.

00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:38.740
Okay.

00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:41.350
By the way,

00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:43.960
I know that truck driver.

00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:45.460
He has a bad temper.

00:21:45.750 --> 00:21:46.960
Have Xiang Beichuan

00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:48.440
buy him a pack of cigarettes later.

00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:49.160
Alright, don't worry.

00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:50.000
I'll tell him.

00:22:02.590 --> 00:22:04.450
Do you know why Mr. Lu isn't going?

00:22:05.420 --> 00:22:06.340
Want to know?

00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:07.720
Wasn't he a director

00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:10.120
at a state-owned factory
for over 10 years?

00:22:10.310 --> 00:22:11.680
Now that

00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:13.210
the company's been merged,

00:22:13.310 --> 00:22:14.640
he's deep in debt.

00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:16.110
Many people are suing

00:22:16.110 --> 00:22:17.030
and reporting him.

00:22:17.030 --> 00:22:17.920
My goodness.

00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:20.240
He's stressed out with all these lawsuits.

00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:21.640
Why are you such a gossip?

00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:23.790
Just focus on your own work.

00:22:33.790 --> 00:22:34.960
I've already bought the cigarettes.

00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:36.070
Let's give them to the driver now.

00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:38.400
Let's see how things go.
Save where we can.

00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:42.840
Sir,

00:22:43.270 --> 00:22:44.400
is this your truck carrying our goods

00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:46.060
from Guoyao Garment Factory?

00:22:47.780 --> 00:22:48.540
Sir,

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:51.510
is this your truck carrying our goods

00:22:51.510 --> 00:22:53.170
from Guoyao Garment Factory?

00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:03.440
We're getting in then.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:09.680
What happened?

00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:10.880
Um, Jiuling,

00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:11.760
you go in first.

00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:52.540
What happened?

00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:54.120
Did we get a flat tire?

00:23:55.550 --> 00:23:56.680
Having two stupid women in the truck

00:23:56.680 --> 00:23:57.740
is really unlucky.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:58.960
Who are you talking about?

00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:00.000
Who are you calling "stupid women?"

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:01.250
I'm talking about you. What's wrong?

00:24:01.250 --> 00:24:01.730
Come on.

00:24:01.790 --> 00:24:02.510
Your flat tire

00:24:02.510 --> 00:24:04.520
has nothing to do with us.

00:24:04.550 --> 00:24:05.400
Do you have a problem?

00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:06.550
You want to fight?

00:24:06.550 --> 00:24:07.000
No, no.

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:07.550
You want to fight?

00:24:07.550 --> 00:24:08.070
Sir, sir.

00:24:08.070 --> 00:24:10.000
We're stupid women.

00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:10.910
We are.

00:24:11.870 --> 00:24:14.160
Judging by your accent,
you're from the Northeast, right?

00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:14.720
Yes.

00:24:15.030 --> 00:24:16.440
I'm from the Northeast too.

00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:17.770
Which city in the Northeast are you from?

00:24:17.770 --> 00:24:19.590
I'm from Liaoyang.

00:24:19.750 --> 00:24:21.000
What a coincidence.

00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:22.200
I'm from Liaoyang too.

00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:22.920
Really?

00:24:23.350 --> 00:24:24.680
Which part of Liaoyang?

00:24:24.910 --> 00:24:25.740
Baxiao.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:26.830
I'm from Baxiao.

00:24:26.830 --> 00:24:28.830
How come I've never seen you before?

00:24:28.850 --> 00:24:29.750
Now that you mention it,

00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:31.400
you do look familiar.

00:24:31.490 --> 00:24:32.030
-Right?
-Sir.

00:24:32.030 --> 00:24:32.640
I'm from that area too.

00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:33.400
Do you have a spare tire?

00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:34.000
No!

00:24:35.310 --> 00:24:36.510
I was about to ask that too.

00:24:36.510 --> 00:24:37.200
So,

00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:39.210
what do we do now?

00:24:39.230 --> 00:24:39.960
What do we do?

00:24:40.090 --> 00:24:41.930
Sis, the rain is really heavy now.

00:24:41.930 --> 00:24:42.950
I really can't do anything.

00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:43.960
It's pitch dark out there.

00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:45.440
Tomorrow morning we'll find a repair shop
to change the tire,

00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:46.240
then we'll continue delivering the goods.

00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:46.900
It won't delay anything.

00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:47.640
-Right.
-It won't delay anything.

00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:48.160
Right.

00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:49.110
I drive this route all the time.

00:24:49.110 --> 00:24:50.480
Let's find a village later.

00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:51.680
There's one up ahead.

00:24:51.890 --> 00:24:53.620
We can have a good chat tonight.

00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:54.400
Let's have a good chat.

00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:55.000
You two?

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:56.000
What about us?

00:24:56.420 --> 00:24:58.030
You two can get out of the truck now!

00:24:58.030 --> 00:24:58.790
Get out!

00:24:59.270 --> 00:24:59.680
No, no.

00:24:59.790 --> 00:25:00.550
Get out!

00:25:00.550 --> 00:25:01.350
Please don't.

00:25:02.030 --> 00:25:02.750
Do me a favor, sir.

00:25:02.750 --> 00:25:03.750
These are my colleagues.

00:25:03.750 --> 00:25:05.200
It wouldn't be right

00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:06.160
if I leave them behind.

00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:08.020
I can't explain it when I get back.

00:25:08.570 --> 00:25:09.370
That's right.

00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:09.720
Yes.

00:25:10.290 --> 00:25:11.150
That quiet one.

00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:12.600
The one who doesn't talk much.

00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:13.310
Let's bring him along.

00:25:13.310 --> 00:25:14.200
Let's bring him along.

00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:14.730
Alright?

00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:16.160
Sir, sir.

00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:16.880
Sir.

00:25:17.370 --> 00:25:17.850
What?

00:25:21.170 --> 00:25:23.010
Bring her along too.

00:25:26.350 --> 00:25:27.080
Is that okay?

00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:28.960
Fine.

00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:30.730
I'll do it for your sake.

00:25:31.790 --> 00:25:32.790
I'll bring her along then.

00:25:32.790 --> 00:25:33.440
Okay.

00:25:33.460 --> 00:25:34.190
Thanks, sir.

00:25:36.970 --> 00:25:37.790
The rain is quite heavy.

00:25:37.790 --> 00:25:38.200
Yeah.

00:25:38.790 --> 00:25:39.980
What did you say about your classmate?

00:25:39.980 --> 00:25:40.670
Sir,

00:25:41.270 --> 00:25:42.160
thank you.

00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:43.070
If it weren't for you,

00:25:43.070 --> 00:25:45.270
the village chief
wouldn't have taken us in.

00:25:45.270 --> 00:25:46.070
It's nothing.

00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:48.130
Your colleague
happens to be from my hometown.

00:25:48.130 --> 00:25:49.350
Thanks for the favor, sir.

00:25:49.350 --> 00:25:50.240
It's my pleasure.

00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:51.030
Thanks, sir.

00:25:53.110 --> 00:25:53.550
Put that down!

00:25:53.550 --> 00:25:54.000
Oh my!

00:25:54.180 --> 00:25:55.780
Who allowed you to take that?

00:25:57.680 --> 00:25:58.910
There are 2 steamed buns.

00:25:58.910 --> 00:25:59.830
I'll just take one.

00:25:59.830 --> 00:26:01.160
There are 2 steamed buns here.
If you eat one,

00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:02.690
what are we supposed to eat?

00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:05.300
Don't take it without my permission.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:06.960
She's just a kid.

00:26:07.070 --> 00:26:07.870
She's hungry.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:08.920
Isn't that perfect?

00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:10.070
Let them share one,

00:26:10.090 --> 00:26:11.240
and we'll share the other.

00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:12.900
Do me a favor and let her eat it.

00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:15.260
Go ahead and eat it.

00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:17.070
Look how hungry you are.

00:26:17.070 --> 00:26:18.000
Like you're the only hungry one.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:18.920
You two eat that one.

00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:19.960
Here, sir, you eat this one.

00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:20.640
You go first.

00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:22.160
I'll go first. This is enough for me.

00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:22.590
I won't eat it.

00:26:22.590 --> 00:26:22.830
I can't eat much.

00:26:22.830 --> 00:26:24.160
I'm not hungry. You eat it.

00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:25.310
It's too little.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:26.920
I'll save it for you.

00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:29.920
Alright, then later
whoever's hungry eats that half.

00:26:30.030 --> 00:26:31.940
Can't I even eat
the pickled mustard tuber?

00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:33.670
Eating only the buns is too dry.

00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:34.880
I don't like this.

00:26:35.550 --> 00:26:36.550
Just eat yours then.

00:26:36.550 --> 00:26:37.130
Eat.

00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:39.550
Keep talking.

00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:40.440
Guys.

00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:41.550
Keep talking.

00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:44.110
I'll go and see if I can make the beds.

00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:45.800
Go ahead.

00:26:45.820 --> 00:26:46.690
Make them then.

00:26:46.890 --> 00:26:48.220
Why did you tell me this?

00:26:50.140 --> 00:26:51.340
I'm going to bed then.

00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:53.520
Sir, could you keep it down a bit?

00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:55.110
Chat normally,

00:26:55.110 --> 00:26:56.790
just a little quieter, please.

00:26:56.790 --> 00:26:57.550
Can you sleep or not?

00:26:57.550 --> 00:26:58.680
I can, I can.

00:26:58.710 --> 00:27:00.640
If you can't sleep, get out of here.

00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:04.340
Xining!

00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:05.600
Ye Xining!

00:27:06.770 --> 00:27:07.820
Ye Xining, come out now!

00:27:07.820 --> 00:27:08.750
Stop sleeping!

00:27:09.550 --> 00:27:09.960
What's wrong?

00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:11.620
Hurry up! Something's wrong!

00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:13.070
What happened?

00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:14.400
Come and take a look at these goods.

00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:15.640
Something's off.

00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:22.030
I was afraid this would happen.

00:27:22.110 --> 00:27:23.790
I was worried
that after a whole night of rain,

00:27:23.790 --> 00:27:25.320
they might get soaked.

00:27:25.340 --> 00:27:26.680
Now look,
they're completely soaked after one night.

00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:27.350
Come on.

00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:31.250
And the color ran too—it stained my hands.

00:27:31.250 --> 00:27:32.100
Oh my god.

00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:33.030
Wait.

00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:34.550
How did the rain leak in?

00:27:34.550 --> 00:27:35.550
Isn't there a waterproof cover?

00:27:35.550 --> 00:27:37.350
Look, it's full of big holes.

00:27:37.350 --> 00:27:39.210
What a lousy truck—
it actually let the rain in.

00:27:39.210 --> 00:27:40.280
A lousy truck?

00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:42.030
The strong wind last night
tore a hole in it.

00:27:42.030 --> 00:27:43.310
What could I do about it?

00:27:43.310 --> 00:27:43.750
I'm telling you,

00:27:43.750 --> 00:27:44.590
if you keep whining like this,

00:27:44.590 --> 00:27:46.110
I'll teach you a good lesson!

00:27:46.110 --> 00:27:47.350
Let's just check the goods.

00:27:47.350 --> 00:27:48.950
Hurry up and check the goods.

00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:53.790
Why is there no care label or main label?

00:27:56.570 --> 00:27:58.500
These ones don't have them either.

00:27:58.920 --> 00:27:59.590
What's wrong?

00:27:59.590 --> 00:28:00.860
None of these have them.

00:28:00.860 --> 00:28:01.790
What do we do now?

00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:03.640
Is there something wrong with this batch?

00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:04.360
Yes.

00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:06.110
Jiuling,

00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:07.910
we need to turn back now

00:28:08.110 --> 00:28:10.370
and bring this batch back to the factory.

00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:12.110
Sir.

00:28:12.110 --> 00:28:12.640
What?

00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:17.970
Jiuling,

00:28:18.590 --> 00:28:19.990
ask your fellow townsman

00:28:20.290 --> 00:28:21.220
to give us a lift.

00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:24.720
Sir,

00:28:25.550 --> 00:28:28.280
could you please take us back
the same way we came?

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:29.660
Sure thing.

00:28:32.790 --> 00:28:33.720
Need my help, sir?

00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:34.400
No need.

00:28:34.420 --> 00:28:35.110
Oh my god.

00:28:45.070 --> 00:28:45.750
Mr. Lu.

00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:49.200
Stop walking back and forth.
You must be tired.

00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:51.060
Your leg isn't good. Take a break.

00:28:57.550 --> 00:28:58.880
In this batch,

00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:00.940
several boxes of jeans are like this.

00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:03.310
The fabric is still the same

00:29:03.310 --> 00:29:04.640
imported cotton we use.

00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:06.680
There's no problem
with the fabric and craftsmanship,

00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:09.270
but there are no main labels
or care labels inside.

00:29:09.270 --> 00:29:11.790
Could these be replica goods
our factory made?

00:29:11.790 --> 00:29:13.960
No main labels or care labels...

00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:18.320
There's a mole in our factory.

00:29:24.750 --> 00:29:26.150
Why are you looking at me?

00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:27.680
What's wrong with that?

00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:29.000
What? You've got something to hide?

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:30.160
That's you.

00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:39.100
How dare you look at Mr. Lu?

00:29:40.790 --> 00:29:41.590
I looked at Mr. Lu

00:29:41.590 --> 00:29:43.720
because I was counting on him
to tell us what to do.

00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:44.310
Someone like you—

00:29:44.310 --> 00:29:45.000
I should have had that truck driver

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:46.880
give you a good beating back then.

00:29:47.030 --> 00:29:48.370
I shouldn't have helped you.

00:29:48.370 --> 00:29:49.240
Besides,

00:29:49.310 --> 00:29:51.350
what's wrong with me looking at Mr. Lu?

00:29:51.350 --> 00:29:53.110
This is Mr. Lu's own factory.

00:29:53.110 --> 00:29:54.440
How could he be the mole?

00:29:55.190 --> 00:29:56.670
What are you thinking?

00:29:58.240 --> 00:29:59.300
So what do we do now?

00:29:59.970 --> 00:30:00.900
Here's the plan.

00:30:01.030 --> 00:30:02.270
I know the secondary market.

00:30:02.270 --> 00:30:04.130
I'll take a look around Qipu Road.

00:30:04.490 --> 00:30:06.690
I'll see who's selling our kind of jeans

00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:08.890
without main labels and care labels.

00:30:08.890 --> 00:30:09.890
I'll definitely

00:30:10.310 --> 00:30:11.680
find this mole.

00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:12.750
When I do,

00:30:12.750 --> 00:30:15.280
I'll have the driver
give them a good beating—

00:30:15.350 --> 00:30:16.880
hold them down and hit them.

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:20.060
Your shoe fell off.

00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:21.440
I know.

00:30:23.270 --> 00:30:24.880
Now who's got something to hide?

00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:26.140
She even lost her shoe.

00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:28.590
Mr. Lu,

00:30:29.310 --> 00:30:31.570
the loss from this batch is a minor issue,

00:30:32.110 --> 00:30:33.550
but the impact on our reputation

00:30:33.550 --> 00:30:34.310
is serious.

00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:36.880
They could even sue us.

00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:39.260
And if it weren't for this heavy rain,

00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:41.160
these jeans

00:30:41.310 --> 00:30:42.960
would have been shipped out already.

00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:43.760
That's right.

00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:45.880
We absolutely cannot

00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:47.550
let Mr. Li know about this.

00:30:48.270 --> 00:30:49.480
If we delay delivery,

00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:50.310
at most

00:30:50.510 --> 00:30:51.840
we'll pay some penalty.

00:30:53.030 --> 00:30:54.680
But if this blows up,

00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:56.680
we'll face legal consequences.

00:30:57.550 --> 00:30:59.950
We could even lose
the company and factory.

00:31:00.110 --> 00:31:00.750
Alright.

00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:02.790
I'll go find Mr. Li right away.

00:31:11.030 --> 00:31:11.880
Mr. Li,

00:31:12.790 --> 00:31:14.720
could you please ask the brand

00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:17.310
to give us a little more time
for delivery?

00:31:18.490 --> 00:31:20.090
Please, just a few days.

00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:22.380
Because we need to reproduce this batch.

00:31:22.550 --> 00:31:23.810
How many have you made?

00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:26.000
About 1,000 pairs in total.

00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:27.160
1,000 pairs?

00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:30.620
You need to figure something out.

00:31:30.620 --> 00:31:32.030
You should be able to deliver on time,
right?

00:31:32.030 --> 00:31:33.510
Could we have a few more days?

00:31:33.510 --> 00:31:35.000
We need to find new fabric

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:35.830
and restart production.

00:31:35.830 --> 00:31:37.160
All of this takes extra time.

00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:37.880
Ye,

00:31:38.310 --> 00:31:39.550
according to the contract,

00:31:39.550 --> 00:31:42.000
a delay in delivery counts as a breach,
right?

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:43.240
And when we signed it,

00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:45.000
it was agreed
there would be a penalty clause.

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:47.200
I reminded you many times before signing.

00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:49.830
It was your promise to deliver on time

00:31:49.830 --> 00:31:51.720
that made me take on a lot of pressure

00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:53.310
and let your factory
handle the production.

00:31:53.310 --> 00:31:53.920
Isn't that right?

00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:54.980
Yes, that's right.

00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:57.560
Mr. Li, we really appreciate your support.

00:31:57.880 --> 00:31:59.960
We didn't want this to happen either.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:01.590
So,

00:32:01.830 --> 00:32:02.480
please,

00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:03.960
could you give us a few more days?

00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:05.960
I'm afraid there's nothing I can do.

00:32:11.270 --> 00:32:12.200
Ye, you're back.

00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:14.480
How did it go? What did Mr. Li say?

00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:17.240
Mr. Li said that
according to the contract,

00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:18.700
a delay counts as a breach.

00:32:19.750 --> 00:32:21.110
Can't they make any exceptions?

00:32:21.110 --> 00:32:21.920
No.

00:32:22.350 --> 00:32:23.150
And he wants us to make up

00:32:23.150 --> 00:32:24.880
for those 1,000 pairs of jeans.

00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:28.480
A 500,000-yuan order

00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:30.650
means a 150,000-yuan penalty.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:33.660
We also need to buy new fabric.

00:32:34.830 --> 00:32:35.920
This order

00:32:37.110 --> 00:32:38.440
will bring us no profit.

00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:40.270
With all the extra costs,

00:32:40.270 --> 00:32:41.470
we might even lose a little.

00:32:41.470 --> 00:32:43.600
Let's think of another solution then.

00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:45.400
Forget it, Ye.

00:32:45.790 --> 00:32:46.790
That's business—

00:32:47.780 --> 00:32:48.880
sometimes you win, sometimes you lose.

00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:50.080
We'll try to make it up

00:32:50.150 --> 00:32:51.310
on the next order.

00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:56.480
How's it going, Jiuling?

00:32:56.480 --> 00:32:57.680
Did you find the mole?

00:32:58.680 --> 00:32:59.740
I found something.

00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:02.000
I went to Qipu Road.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:03.550
There really is a shop selling jeans

00:33:03.550 --> 00:33:04.720
exactly like ours.

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:06.750
I followed him secretly

00:33:06.790 --> 00:33:08.140
and ended up at a small warehouse.

00:33:08.140 --> 00:33:09.030
Whose place is it?

00:33:09.030 --> 00:33:09.890
How shameless.

00:33:11.490 --> 00:33:12.550
Just tell us here.

00:33:12.550 --> 00:33:14.080
You're acting like a thief.

00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:16.650
Whose shop is it?

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:17.910
His.

00:33:18.270 --> 00:33:19.070
So shameless.

00:33:19.670 --> 00:33:20.360
His nephew.

00:33:28.030 --> 00:33:28.960
I'm shameless?

00:33:30.940 --> 00:33:32.470
I discussed it with Yan Jun.

00:33:32.470 --> 00:33:33.160
He said

00:33:33.270 --> 00:33:34.000
we could use

00:33:34.380 --> 00:33:36.460
some of our leftover fabric

00:33:36.590 --> 00:33:38.420
to make a batch of replica goods.

00:33:39.350 --> 00:33:41.080
The goods are in the warehouse,

00:33:41.590 --> 00:33:43.320
and my nephew is watching them.

00:33:44.350 --> 00:33:46.200
Wait. Since you knew about this,

00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:48.730
why did you make me run all the way
to Qipu Road?

00:33:48.770 --> 00:33:50.170
I was sweating all day,

00:33:50.190 --> 00:33:51.400
standing there for hours.

00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:53.400
I went there with that truck driver.

00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:55.790
He was about to hit him with a brick,

00:33:55.790 --> 00:33:56.920
but when he turned his head,

00:33:56.920 --> 00:33:58.040
I realized it was your nephew.

00:33:58.040 --> 00:33:59.700
What if he'd actually hit him?

00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:02.290
Mr. Lu,

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:04.200
for such a big matter,

00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:06.060
why didn't you discuss it with us?

00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:07.920
Yan Jun said

00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:09.370
he had a distribution channel

00:34:09.370 --> 00:34:11.400
to sell these goods.

00:34:12.870 --> 00:34:15.440
As long as
we don't put the brand's labels on them,

00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:17.040
no one can trace it back to us.

00:34:17.550 --> 00:34:18.440
I just thought

00:34:19.070 --> 00:34:20.440
the workers

00:34:20.610 --> 00:34:21.739
could earn a bit more

00:34:22.150 --> 00:34:22.719
if they

00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:24.580
made a few extra pairs.

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:26.929
This way they'd be more motivated.

00:34:27.670 --> 00:34:29.330
I was thinking of the workers.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:30.760
Mr. Lu,

00:34:31.150 --> 00:34:33.350
if these replica goods are discovered,

00:34:33.670 --> 00:34:35.550
the brand will make us pay compensation.

00:34:35.550 --> 00:34:36.360
That's right.

00:34:36.710 --> 00:34:38.909
We might even face legal consequences.

00:34:41.230 --> 00:34:43.690
Trying to save a little
ends up costing a lot.

00:34:44.110 --> 00:34:45.440
Let's go and take a look.

00:34:45.550 --> 00:34:46.360
So you're aware of the saying

00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:48.320
"trying to save a little
ends up costing a lot?"

00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:49.630
And you still have to drag me along.

00:34:49.630 --> 00:34:50.630
I just got back.

00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:51.949
Just stop talking.

00:35:01.810 --> 00:35:02.440
Stop here.

00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:03.680
Here's fine.

00:35:12.590 --> 00:35:13.230
Uncle.

00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:15.240
You can go now.

00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:15.980
Don't move!

00:35:16.670 --> 00:35:17.930
We're on the same side.

00:35:23.550 --> 00:35:25.280
Are all these our factory's replica goods?

00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:26.920
We didn't have this much leftover fabric.

00:35:26.920 --> 00:35:28.230
There are more than 1,000 pairs here.

00:35:28.230 --> 00:35:28.710
Jiuling,

00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:31.370
quick, you open those boxes
and I'll open these.

00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:39.150
Mr. Lu,

00:35:40.450 --> 00:35:42.250
could it be that on that rainy day

00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:43.650
the workers made a mistake

00:35:43.650 --> 00:35:44.640
and put some replica goods

00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:46.530
on the truck heading to the brand?

00:35:47.420 --> 00:35:49.820
There's something wrong with these jeans.

00:35:51.230 --> 00:35:52.560
The fabric isn't right.

00:35:53.210 --> 00:35:54.410
Come and look at this.

00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:05.480
These are fakes.

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:06.800
Fakes?

00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:08.520
Even the labels are fake.

00:36:10.070 --> 00:36:11.590
Judging from the stitching on these pants,

00:36:11.590 --> 00:36:13.720
this is our factory's craftsmanship.

00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:14.960
So that means

00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:16.070
those

00:36:16.630 --> 00:36:19.000
are replica goods
made by our factory's leftover material,

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:21.600
and these are fakes
made with inferior fabric.

00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:23.840
Yan Jun

00:36:24.150 --> 00:36:25.590
is really despicable.

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:28.030
Was this something you planned together?

00:36:28.030 --> 00:36:28.840
Ye,

00:36:28.860 --> 00:36:30.590
we've been in the clothing business
for years.

00:36:30.590 --> 00:36:31.670
How could I dare?

00:36:32.110 --> 00:36:33.910
This could destroy everything.

00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:35.070
Yan Jun

00:36:35.070 --> 00:36:37.300
said one thing to my face
and did another behind my back.

00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:39.500
He promised to only make replica goods,

00:36:39.510 --> 00:36:41.440
but secretly made a batch of fakes.

00:36:41.790 --> 00:36:43.550
He must have bribed our workshop manager

00:36:43.550 --> 00:36:46.080
to make these counterfeits
with fake fabric.

00:36:46.110 --> 00:36:48.240
We can't let Mr. Li know about this yet.

00:36:48.550 --> 00:36:50.260
I need to go back
to find Yan Jun right away.

00:36:50.260 --> 00:36:50.900
Yes.

00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:52.960
This must be kept confidential.

00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:54.230
Don't let anyone know about this.

00:36:54.230 --> 00:36:55.030
Do you hear me?

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:56.880
And you guys!

00:36:56.880 --> 00:36:58.610
Sort out all the counterfeits!

00:36:58.920 --> 00:36:59.710
Let's go.

00:36:59.710 --> 00:37:00.840
I'll drive you back.

00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:03.400
Sis.

00:37:04.310 --> 00:37:05.790
When can I go back?

00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:07.230
Thanks, sir.

00:37:07.510 --> 00:37:08.840
You can go back now.

00:37:09.030 --> 00:37:11.020
Alright, remember to call me
when you're free.

00:37:11.020 --> 00:37:11.680
Sure thing.

00:37:11.990 --> 00:37:12.590
Thanks.

00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:16.550
Miss Ye.

00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:21.550
Mr. Yan,

00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:22.960
let's have a talk.

00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:27.880
Miss Ye,

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:29.730
why didn't Mr. Lu come himself?

00:37:30.230 --> 00:37:32.430
I was the one who approached you before,

00:37:32.590 --> 00:37:34.850
so now I should be the one
to resolve this.

00:37:39.390 --> 00:37:40.510
Let's be direct.

00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:43.400
You bribed the workshop manager

00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:44.440
and the workers

00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:47.100
to produce over 1,000 counterfeit pieces.

00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:47.620
Yes.

00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:50.190
That way I could make a bit more money.

00:37:50.190 --> 00:37:51.960
And I'll give the workers
some extra allowance.

00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:53.270
It's a win-win.

00:37:54.920 --> 00:37:57.320
If the brand finds out
you're selling fakes,

00:37:57.320 --> 00:37:58.920
what do you think they'll do?

00:37:59.710 --> 00:38:01.400
They don't know yet, do they?

00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:05.030
Miss Ye,

00:38:05.590 --> 00:38:06.230
Do you know why

00:38:06.230 --> 00:38:08.230
my business is bigger than Mr. Lu's?

00:38:09.310 --> 00:38:11.140
Because I'm flexible.

00:38:11.650 --> 00:38:13.910
That's why I can handle things smoothly.

00:38:14.030 --> 00:38:15.690
That's how you make big money.

00:38:16.710 --> 00:38:17.360
Mr. Yan,

00:38:17.670 --> 00:38:19.280
I'm here to solve the problem.

00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:20.880
You don't need to lecture me.

00:38:22.030 --> 00:38:23.550
If the brand finds out,

00:38:24.110 --> 00:38:25.040
what do you think

00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:26.520
they will do about it?

00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:27.960
If they find out,

00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:30.160
Mr. Lu's company will also be affected.

00:38:30.440 --> 00:38:33.370
Do you really want to harm others
at your own expense?

00:38:33.470 --> 00:38:34.100
Mr. Yan,

00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:36.440
the legal consequences
for selling counterfeits

00:38:36.440 --> 00:38:38.030
are much more serious
than what we're facing.

00:38:38.030 --> 00:38:40.230
At worst, we'll just pay compensation.

00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:45.610
Then go ahead and sue me.

00:38:46.510 --> 00:38:47.710
But think carefully—

00:38:48.110 --> 00:38:49.280
once you do that,

00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:52.190
your company's reputation will be ruined.

00:38:52.190 --> 00:38:54.030
You won't get any more orders
in the future.

00:38:54.030 --> 00:38:56.310
You're the ones
who only do clothing business,

00:38:56.310 --> 00:38:57.250
not me.

00:38:58.400 --> 00:38:59.110
Mr. Yan,

00:38:59.670 --> 00:39:01.960
if they investigate
your sale of counterfeit goods,

00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:03.960
your company's funds will be frozen

00:39:04.280 --> 00:39:06.670
and your other businesses
will be affected.

00:39:06.670 --> 00:39:08.400
Aren't you worried about that?

00:39:11.110 --> 00:39:13.170
Then Miss Ye, what do you want me to do?

00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:15.150
The batch of jeans that got wet

00:39:15.150 --> 00:39:16.480
needs to be reproduced,

00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:18.590
but Mr. Lu

00:39:19.030 --> 00:39:21.010
doesn't have money to buy new fabric.

00:39:21.010 --> 00:39:22.340
Alright, I understand.

00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:25.400
I'll cover the cost to remake the jeans.

00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:26.720
But...

00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:29.110
you have to give me

00:39:29.110 --> 00:39:30.910
all the jeans in your warehouse,

00:39:31.030 --> 00:39:31.960
including the wet ones.

00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:33.160
That's not possible.

00:39:33.230 --> 00:39:34.710
The fabric is ours.

00:39:34.980 --> 00:39:36.590
If you sell them and something goes wrong,

00:39:36.590 --> 00:39:38.450
the responsibility will be on us.

00:39:39.590 --> 00:39:41.320
Then give me all the fake jeans

00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:42.480
made from the fabric I bought.

00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:43.840
That should be acceptable, right?

00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:44.840
That's fine.

00:39:45.070 --> 00:39:47.280
But you can't
put the current brand labels on them.

00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:48.210
You handle it.

00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:49.010
I don't care.

00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:50.760
Okay, no problem.

00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:51.480
Good.

00:39:52.070 --> 00:39:52.590
Mr. Yan,

00:39:53.070 --> 00:39:54.000
it's a deal.

00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:55.110
This time,

00:39:55.280 --> 00:39:56.740
don't go back on your word.

00:39:59.030 --> 00:39:59.920
Miss Ye,

00:40:00.230 --> 00:40:01.890
I need to teach you something.

00:40:02.960 --> 00:40:04.150
Only people like Beichuan

00:40:04.150 --> 00:40:05.230
would see words

00:40:05.590 --> 00:40:07.190
like despicable, cunning,

00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:08.670
untrustworthy, and deceitful

00:40:08.670 --> 00:40:10.070
as negative words.

00:40:11.230 --> 00:40:12.150
The fact that you

00:40:12.150 --> 00:40:14.550
could say those things
to threaten me today

00:40:14.570 --> 00:40:15.360
is good.

00:40:16.470 --> 00:40:18.530
You have what it takes to do business.

00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:21.630
You mean...

00:40:22.030 --> 00:40:23.690
we're the same kind of people?

00:40:25.070 --> 00:40:26.320
Maybe not yet,

00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:28.000
but I think we will be in the future.

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:29.400
We won't be in the future.

00:40:31.070 --> 00:40:32.080
I won't disturb you anymore.

00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:33.080
I'll be going now.

00:40:34.110 --> 00:40:35.770
Well then, Miss Ye, take care.

00:40:48.550 --> 00:40:49.280
You're back?

00:40:54.670 --> 00:40:55.270
Beichuan.

00:40:57.310 --> 00:40:58.240
Xiang Beichuan?

00:41:05.590 --> 00:41:06.400
What's wrong, Professor Xiang?

00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:07.600
You don't seem happy.

00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:11.030
Yan Jun,

00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:13.550
you're absolutely insane.

00:41:14.440 --> 00:41:16.440
How could you do business like this?

00:41:17.630 --> 00:41:19.690
And you've put me in a difficult spot.

00:41:20.150 --> 00:41:22.440
How have I put you in a difficult spot?

00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:25.970
I've praised you plenty
in front of Ye Xining,

00:41:26.150 --> 00:41:28.810
saying you're a businessman
with a conscience.

00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:37.630
I've already resolved this matter.

00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:41.020
I'm going to lose quite a bit of money.

00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:42.710
You deserve it.

00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:51.850
Why do you think
I'm being so good to this girl?

00:41:52.280 --> 00:41:53.590
Do I like her?

00:41:56.630 --> 00:41:58.360
Do you think we're a good match?

00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:00.630
Yes.

00:42:00.710 --> 00:42:01.480
Really?

00:42:01.870 --> 00:42:02.750
Really.

00:42:05.190 --> 00:42:06.850
Anyone is a good match with me.

00:42:07.110 --> 00:42:08.710
You've got that backwards.

00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:11.920
I'm a good match with anyone.

00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:15.470
I can give the girls
enough sense of security.

00:42:17.700 --> 00:42:18.610
Not security.

00:42:18.840 --> 00:42:19.550
It's...

00:42:20.190 --> 00:42:21.190
happiness.

00:42:22.710 --> 00:42:23.950
You're truly crazy.
