BEYOND THE BAR

00:01:36.096 --> 00:01:41.018
AN EYE FOR AN EYE, A TOOTH FOR A TOOTH

00:01:41.977 --> 00:01:44.896
{\an8}- Good shot!
- Great!

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:45.856
{\an8}It's almost there!

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:47.274
{\an8}It's so close.

00:01:47.357 --> 00:01:48.483
{\an8}Good shot!

00:01:48.567 --> 00:01:50.277
{\an8}- Impressive.
- Just make your approach shot.

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.404
{\an8}- It's going all the way.
- Mr. Choi.

00:01:53.655 --> 00:01:55.449
{\an8}Let me get straight to the point.

00:01:55.532 --> 00:01:56.867
{\an8}Please.

00:01:57.618 --> 00:01:58.702
{\an8}I only like the best.

00:01:59.244 --> 00:02:00.120
{\an8}I see.

00:02:00.871 --> 00:02:04.166
{\an8}That's why I work
with Korea's top law firm, Lee & Seo.

00:02:05.876 --> 00:02:08.420
{\an8}We, Yullim, still have
a long way to go, Mr. Choi.

00:02:09.671 --> 00:02:13.216
{\an8}I owe Mr. Ko Seung-cheol
a great deal personally.

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.303
That's why I'm giving you this chance.

00:02:16.386 --> 00:02:18.388
Thank you so much.

00:02:18.472 --> 00:02:19.348
We'll do our best.

00:02:19.431 --> 00:02:20.766
Don't thank me yet.

00:02:23.268 --> 00:02:24.144
Sorry?

00:02:24.978 --> 00:02:25.979
There's a condition.

00:02:27.022 --> 00:02:28.315
What kind of…

00:02:29.733 --> 00:02:31.943
Something bothersome came up on my end,

00:02:32.027 --> 00:02:33.862
and I need someone to deal with it.

00:02:33.945 --> 00:02:35.822
No problem. We're on it.

00:02:35.906 --> 00:02:37.115
Mr. Hong Do-yun here…

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:38.325
- No.
- He…

00:02:39.117 --> 00:02:40.827
There's someone I want.

00:02:41.495 --> 00:02:42.496
Who…

00:02:43.288 --> 00:02:44.456
Mr. Yoon Seok-hoon.

00:02:47.542 --> 00:02:50.253
His track record isn't so great…

00:02:50.337 --> 00:02:53.674
I heard he has a high win rate
and handles his work with precision.

00:02:53.757 --> 00:02:55.092
Right…

00:02:55.592 --> 00:02:56.802
That's my condition.

00:02:57.427 --> 00:03:00.389
If Mr. Yoon takes on my personal case,

00:03:00.472 --> 00:03:03.058
I'll entrust COMO Fund's
SMR-focused investment deal

00:03:03.141 --> 00:03:05.268
to Yullim, not Lee & Seo Law Firm.

00:03:11.191 --> 00:03:12.567
Here, sir.

00:03:13.443 --> 00:03:15.237
Excuse me, I need to use the restroom.

00:03:16.988 --> 00:03:18.865
- Take your time, sir.
- Take your time.

00:03:20.534 --> 00:03:21.952
My goodness.

00:03:22.035 --> 00:03:22.953
What do we do?

00:03:23.704 --> 00:03:25.622
Why does it have to be Yoon Seok-hoon?

00:03:25.706 --> 00:03:26.832
I doubt he'd do it.

00:03:27.457 --> 00:03:29.793
I'll make him do it.

00:03:30.711 --> 00:03:32.754
The division head of Litigation
is Kim Yul-seong,

00:03:32.838 --> 00:03:34.131
my father's right-hand man.

00:03:34.214 --> 00:03:35.424
That's right.

00:03:35.507 --> 00:03:38.301
That means he'll be on your side.

00:03:38.385 --> 00:03:39.344
I'd say so.

00:03:39.928 --> 00:03:42.514
Mr. Yoon may not listen to me,

00:03:42.597 --> 00:03:43.849
but he listens to Mr. Kim.

00:03:43.932 --> 00:03:45.016
- He does?
- Yes.

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:45.976
I guess so.

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:48.145
Mr. Kim Yul-seong was the mentor
of Ms. Kwon Na-yeon,

00:03:48.228 --> 00:03:50.272
who was Mr. Yoon's mentor.

00:03:50.355 --> 00:03:51.356
Jeez.

00:03:52.899 --> 00:03:54.443
Why Yoon of all people?

00:04:04.411 --> 00:04:05.620
Come on in.

00:04:07.289 --> 00:04:08.165
You heard, right?

00:04:08.915 --> 00:04:10.417
Mr. Ko here

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.502
brought in COMO Fund as our client.

00:04:12.586 --> 00:04:14.087
Not yet, Mr. Kim.

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:17.799
That's only possible
if our great Mr. Yoon lends us a hand.

00:04:17.883 --> 00:04:19.342
Then it's a done deal.

00:04:19.426 --> 00:04:22.554
This is Mr. Choi Cheol-min.

00:04:22.637 --> 00:04:24.806
He's the founder and CEO of COMO Fund.

00:04:26.558 --> 00:04:30.687
This is Mr. Yoon Seok-hoon,
our top litigation attorney.

00:04:32.022 --> 00:04:33.231
I've heard a lot about you.

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:35.692
That you're a great attorney.

00:04:36.443 --> 00:04:37.944
Thank you.

00:04:39.821 --> 00:04:40.906
But…

00:04:41.823 --> 00:04:44.618
shouldn't the COMO Fund case be handled

00:04:44.701 --> 00:04:46.411
by the M&A team, not Litigation?

00:04:46.495 --> 00:04:47.496
Yes.

00:04:47.579 --> 00:04:51.833
The SMR investment deal
will be handled by the M&A team.

00:04:51.917 --> 00:04:53.376
The reason I called you here

00:04:54.002 --> 00:04:56.880
is because Mr. Choi
has a personal litigation case.

00:04:58.548 --> 00:05:01.218
Now that our expert's here,
please go ahead.

00:05:01.301 --> 00:05:02.844
I want to file a defamation lawsuit.

00:05:03.929 --> 00:05:05.430
Against whom?

00:05:05.514 --> 00:05:06.723
My housekeeper.

00:05:09.726 --> 00:05:11.603
What happened?

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:14.231
It's…

00:05:14.856 --> 00:05:16.983
Please feel free to tell us.

00:05:18.902 --> 00:05:21.780
She reported me to the police
for abusing my daughter.

00:05:22.447 --> 00:05:24.491
She even went to the media.

00:05:25.283 --> 00:05:28.995
With help from people around me,
I got through it without major trouble.

00:05:29.079 --> 00:05:31.915
But if I let this slide,
she might cause even more trouble.

00:05:32.666 --> 00:05:34.459
Is that why you're suing her?

00:05:34.543 --> 00:05:35.544
I'm not sure.

00:05:36.378 --> 00:05:38.547
I'm not a fan of drama or complications,

00:05:39.172 --> 00:05:42.676
so I'd prefer to settle this quietly
without taking it to court.

00:05:43.343 --> 00:05:45.887
Whether it's legal pressure
or lawful intimidation,

00:05:46.513 --> 00:05:48.557
can't we resolve it that way?

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:51.768
She must be acting that way
because she's holding something over you.

00:05:51.852 --> 00:05:53.436
She says she took pictures.

00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:56.189
- Pictures?
- Yes.

00:05:56.273 --> 00:05:57.357
Do you have them?

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:58.775
Yes.

00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:08.618
Gosh…

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:13.456
How did she…

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:14.416
I don't know.

00:06:14.499 --> 00:06:18.086
Bruises or cuts…
Those can easily be faked with makeup.

00:06:18.837 --> 00:06:21.256
I'm too busy to spend much time
with my daughter,

00:06:21.798 --> 00:06:25.302
but she's with her every day.
She could easily fabricate anything.

00:06:26.595 --> 00:06:27.721
In situations like this,

00:06:28.346 --> 00:06:31.141
the one with more to lose
becomes the weaker side.

00:06:31.224 --> 00:06:33.018
When the media gets the story wrong,

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.312
the truth no longer matters.

00:06:36.104 --> 00:06:37.814
If the company's image is damaged,

00:06:37.898 --> 00:06:40.775
it won't just hurt me.
It will affect the investors too.

00:06:41.484 --> 00:06:42.527
I need to be careful.

00:06:43.528 --> 00:06:44.821
I'm sure.

00:06:44.905 --> 00:06:48.700
Looks like you're
dealing with a nasty one here.

00:06:48.783 --> 00:06:51.077
I thought about
just paying her to stop this,

00:06:51.745 --> 00:06:52.871
but I realized it might look

00:06:52.954 --> 00:06:55.457
like I was admitting
to something that I didn't do.

00:06:56.166 --> 00:06:57.626
So I couldn't risk that.

00:07:00.337 --> 00:07:03.924
Word is, there's a VIP among
the real investors behind COMO Fund.

00:07:04.549 --> 00:07:06.384
Many political elites
are somehow involved,

00:07:06.468 --> 00:07:09.638
and so are several entrepreneurs
with roots in organized crime.

00:07:10.513 --> 00:07:14.517
Mr. Choi Cheol-min doesn't seem like
someone who would do that to his daughter.

00:07:15.226 --> 00:07:17.562
He comes off as a sweet guy in the media.

00:07:18.188 --> 00:07:19.981
To put it bluntly,

00:07:20.065 --> 00:07:22.067
he's so powerful
that it wouldn't be surprising

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:24.569
if he killed someone and walked free.

00:07:24.653 --> 00:07:25.862
MR. KIM YUL-SEONG

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:31.660
Hello, Mr. Kim.

00:07:31.743 --> 00:07:36.206
He said he'd accept
the 500 million won retainer fee

00:07:36.289 --> 00:07:37.832
we suggested to Mr. Choi.

00:07:37.916 --> 00:07:39.042
I see.

00:07:39.876 --> 00:07:42.253
He said the retainer was a bit high,

00:07:42.337 --> 00:07:44.339
but he'll go along with your request.

00:07:45.006 --> 00:07:46.049
So?

00:07:46.132 --> 00:07:47.926
I'll take the case.

00:07:48.843 --> 00:07:49.803
Okay.

00:07:52.347 --> 00:07:55.475
The COMO Fund fee is finalized.
Go ahead and proceed.

00:07:56.101 --> 00:07:57.310
Are you really doing this?

00:08:00.105 --> 00:08:02.649
Did Mr. Yoon seriously take that case?

00:08:02.732 --> 00:08:04.275
Yes. I don't get it.

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:07.696
You know his policy
on cases involving children.

00:08:07.779 --> 00:08:08.655
I know.

00:08:08.738 --> 00:08:11.741
He never takes cases
involving child abuse, domestic violence,

00:08:11.825 --> 00:08:13.451
or animal cruelty, no matter what.

00:08:14.744 --> 00:08:17.747
And if Mr. Yoon ends up winning this case,

00:08:18.248 --> 00:08:20.750
then COMO Fund will become
Mr. Ko Tae-seop's client.

00:08:20.834 --> 00:08:23.128
That would instantly
make him number one in revenue.

00:08:23.211 --> 00:08:26.548
With his father being a founder,
and that kind of achievement…

00:08:26.631 --> 00:08:28.049
That'll make him a managing partner.

00:08:29.217 --> 00:08:30.802
Then we'll…

00:08:33.138 --> 00:08:35.223
Hey, don't worry.

00:08:35.724 --> 00:08:37.392
You know what Mr. Yoon is like.

00:08:39.686 --> 00:08:41.187
Here you are.

00:08:41.271 --> 00:08:42.564
What is it?

00:08:42.647 --> 00:08:44.858
Mr. Kim Yul-seong wants you
in the meeting room.

00:08:44.941 --> 00:08:47.652
I don't have any meetings today.
Is it an internal meeting?

00:08:47.736 --> 00:08:48.778
No.

00:08:48.862 --> 00:08:51.906
It's your new client.
I think it's a divorce case.

00:08:52.574 --> 00:08:54.200
She's a walk-in.

00:08:56.202 --> 00:08:57.078
Bye.

00:09:02.792 --> 00:09:04.294
Don't worry too much.

00:09:04.377 --> 00:09:07.797
- We'll do our best for this case.
- Okay.

00:09:08.298 --> 00:09:09.549
Yes.

00:09:09.632 --> 00:09:10.633
Come in.

00:09:11.134 --> 00:09:12.844
This is our new client
in the divorce case--

00:09:12.927 --> 00:09:14.137
What are you doing here?

00:09:16.431 --> 00:09:17.807
Do you two know each other?

00:09:17.891 --> 00:09:19.225
It's been a while.

00:09:19.309 --> 00:09:20.727
I said, what are you doing here?

00:09:22.645 --> 00:09:24.064
What's going on?

00:09:24.147 --> 00:09:27.859
I'm sorry, but would you
mind giving us a moment?

00:09:36.034 --> 00:09:37.952
Who is she? Why is Ms. Heo so serious?

00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:40.288
What's going on?

00:09:41.581 --> 00:09:42.874
It's nothing.

00:09:43.458 --> 00:09:45.168
My gosh, so scary.

00:09:46.086 --> 00:09:47.045
Who is?

00:09:47.629 --> 00:09:48.797
Ms. Heo Min-jeong?

00:09:49.297 --> 00:09:50.173
Yes.

00:09:50.799 --> 00:09:53.510
Honestly, she scares me more than my wife.

00:09:55.887 --> 00:09:58.139
And who is she?

00:09:58.223 --> 00:10:00.058
That's the divorce case client.

00:10:01.059 --> 00:10:03.228
She said she came
because of my reputation.

00:10:03.311 --> 00:10:05.021
I bet it was Ms. Heo's reputation.

00:10:06.731 --> 00:10:08.983
I mean,
you're an incredible named partner.

00:10:09.067 --> 00:10:10.193
Look how she came to see you.

00:10:12.362 --> 00:10:13.571
- Thanks.
- Sure.

00:10:14.405 --> 00:10:16.574
She came here for a divorce case,

00:10:16.658 --> 00:10:18.493
and it looks like they're acquaintances.

00:10:18.576 --> 00:10:19.828
It seemed pretty intense.

00:10:21.079 --> 00:10:21.955
Is that so?

00:10:29.963 --> 00:10:31.923
Next is a defense case in a recourse claim

00:10:32.006 --> 00:10:34.384
filed by insurance companies
that paid compensation

00:10:34.467 --> 00:10:36.427
to victims of the Pohang earthquake.

00:10:37.053 --> 00:10:39.180
I guess we'll need to go
meet the defendants in Pohang.

00:10:39.264 --> 00:10:42.684
Yes. I'll take Mr. Ji,
Mr. Oh, and Ms. Choi.

00:10:42.767 --> 00:10:44.811
As it happens, the Labor Office hearing

00:10:44.894 --> 00:10:47.730
for the Pohang Mayor case
has been set for around the same time,

00:10:47.814 --> 00:10:50.942
so we're planning
to stay in Pohang for about a week.

00:10:51.526 --> 00:10:52.861
Okay.

00:10:53.653 --> 00:10:55.071
You'll be so lonely, Hyo-min.

00:10:55.155 --> 00:10:56.281
With all of us in Pohang,

00:10:56.364 --> 00:10:58.658
you'll be the only one
working at the office.

00:10:58.741 --> 00:10:59.993
Quiet.

00:11:00.076 --> 00:11:01.286
Yes, sir!

00:11:01.828 --> 00:11:02.704
Next.

00:11:02.787 --> 00:11:05.665
Next is a criminal complaint filed
by Mr. Choi Cheol-min,

00:11:05.748 --> 00:11:08.251
CEO of COMO Fund,
against his housekeeper for defamation

00:11:08.334 --> 00:11:10.378
and related charges,
under reference number 273-17.

00:11:10.461 --> 00:11:11.337
Right.

00:11:11.421 --> 00:11:14.090
How shall I proceed?

00:11:15.508 --> 00:11:17.677
Get me a meeting with the housekeeper.

00:11:29.731 --> 00:11:30.857
Ms. Kang.

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:32.483
The info on Mr. Choi's housekeeper.

00:11:32.567 --> 00:11:33.735
7-1, SONGBAEK-RO, JEONGWON-GU

00:11:33.818 --> 00:11:35.612
She's not answering her phone.

00:11:35.695 --> 00:11:37.488
I need to be in court by two o'clock.

00:11:37.572 --> 00:11:39.616
Why don't you go meet her first?

00:11:40.241 --> 00:11:41.117
Will do.

00:11:41.201 --> 00:11:43.494
Just go over there and hear her out.

00:11:43.578 --> 00:11:46.039
The priority is to figure out
what she's after.

00:11:46.122 --> 00:11:47.957
- Okay.
- Ji, Oh, and Choi.

00:11:48.583 --> 00:11:49.459
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:11:49.542 --> 00:11:51.419
We're off to Pohang tomorrow,

00:11:51.502 --> 00:11:53.796
so wrap up and submit your tasks
by end of day.

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:55.089
- Okay.
- Yes.

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:19.364
- Excuse me, ma'am.
- Yes?

00:12:22.158 --> 00:12:23.868
- Do you know where this is?
- Let's see.

00:12:23.952 --> 00:12:25.119
I know.

00:12:25.203 --> 00:12:27.038
You can go up there.

00:12:27.121 --> 00:12:28.665
- Right.
- Over there.

00:12:28.748 --> 00:12:29.666
Up there?

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:31.584
Thank you.

00:12:35.088 --> 00:12:36.089
Let's go.

00:12:41.177 --> 00:12:42.470
It's somewhere over here.

00:12:43.513 --> 00:12:44.639
Seven dash one.

00:12:49.894 --> 00:12:50.937
Hello?

00:12:56.067 --> 00:12:57.610
Who is it?

00:12:57.694 --> 00:12:58.695
Hello, sir.

00:13:00.822 --> 00:13:01.698
KANG HYO-MIN

00:13:01.781 --> 00:13:04.367
I'm Kang Hyo-min,
an attorney at Yullim Law Firm.

00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:06.536
Is this Ms. Kim Yeong-suk's residence?

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:09.122
Yes. What do you want?

00:13:09.831 --> 00:13:10.748
Who's at the door?

00:13:11.916 --> 00:13:13.293
Some attorney's here.

00:13:13.376 --> 00:13:14.294
What?

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:16.796
Attorney?

00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:18.506
Hello, ma'am.

00:13:22.885 --> 00:13:26.556
I was just too heartbroken.
I had no choice. I had to do it.

00:13:28.433 --> 00:13:29.642
That poor thing…

00:13:32.437 --> 00:13:34.564
It got to a point where checking her

00:13:34.647 --> 00:13:37.233
was the first thing I would do
whenever I was there,

00:13:37.317 --> 00:13:39.819
wondering how badly
he had beaten her this time,

00:13:39.902 --> 00:13:41.446
how painful it must have been,

00:13:42.322 --> 00:13:43.948
how terrified she would've been…

00:13:45.950 --> 00:13:50.079
Sometimes while I'm cleaning,
she seems so quiet

00:13:50.163 --> 00:13:52.498
that I look over to check on her,

00:13:53.624 --> 00:13:58.546
only to find her
staring blankly out the window.

00:13:58.629 --> 00:14:01.132
That's not the face of a six-year-old.

00:14:02.383 --> 00:14:05.553
Is there any other proof
besides the pictures?

00:14:05.636 --> 00:14:09.974
I thought about installing
a hidden camera to get some kind of proof,

00:14:10.058 --> 00:14:12.560
but just surviving
day to day is hard enough.

00:14:12.643 --> 00:14:16.147
So in the end,
I just took pictures of her injuries.

00:14:16.773 --> 00:14:18.149
So is there no direct evidence

00:14:18.232 --> 00:14:21.110
that Mr. Choi Cheol-min
caused the injuries in the photos?

00:14:21.194 --> 00:14:23.988
What else could it be?

00:14:24.072 --> 00:14:25.907
No one falls that often.

00:14:26.949 --> 00:14:30.203
Have you actually seen
Mr. Choi Cheol-min hitting the child?

00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:36.501
He may be rough with the child,
but he's never hit her in front of me.

00:14:37.126 --> 00:14:40.088
But you can tell by how the child reacts.

00:14:40.671 --> 00:14:41.964
As soon as her dad shows up,

00:14:42.048 --> 00:14:45.343
I see the blood drain from her face,
and she hides behind me.

00:14:45.426 --> 00:14:47.303
Good God…

00:14:47.387 --> 00:14:50.848
Honestly, I can't even count
how many times I thought

00:14:50.932 --> 00:14:53.601
about running away
from that house with her.

00:14:54.394 --> 00:14:59.065
One day, I went to their house,
but she was nowhere to be seen.

00:14:59.148 --> 00:15:01.484
- In-yeong!
- I was looking for her,

00:15:01.567 --> 00:15:03.236
wondering if she'd gone out with her dad.

00:15:03.319 --> 00:15:05.405
But I found her hiding in the closet.

00:15:05.488 --> 00:15:06.406
My goodness!

00:15:06.489 --> 00:15:09.283
He'd beaten her so badly.

00:15:10.201 --> 00:15:12.453
- Oh dear.
- I cried with her in my arms.

00:15:12.537 --> 00:15:15.373
I could feel her trembling.

00:15:15.456 --> 00:15:16.541
In-yeong.

00:15:16.624 --> 00:15:19.710
I could tell something wasn't right.

00:15:20.336 --> 00:15:23.339
As I was about
to take her to the hospital,

00:15:23.423 --> 00:15:26.426
- that devil came home with some guy.
- Yes, Congressman.

00:15:26.509 --> 00:15:27.427
Have you eaten?

00:15:27.927 --> 00:15:30.847
He was afraid of being exposed,

00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:34.851
so he had a doctor come home instead.

00:15:37.812 --> 00:15:38.938
Yes, ma'am.

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:40.565
I forgot to tell you.

00:15:40.648 --> 00:15:43.901
After that, the doctor kept coming
to the house from time to time

00:15:43.985 --> 00:15:45.194
to treat her.

00:15:45.278 --> 00:15:46.821
Yes.

00:15:46.904 --> 00:15:50.032
He wouldn't send her to daycare
until she made a full recovery.

00:15:55.204 --> 00:15:57.582
That's why there are no medical records,

00:15:57.665 --> 00:15:59.625
and the daycare had no idea.

00:15:59.709 --> 00:16:00.960
He's the devil.

00:16:01.043 --> 00:16:02.920
He's beyond redemption.

00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:08.092
I saw that the police report
was dismissed.

00:16:08.176 --> 00:16:09.802
They're all in it together.

00:16:10.803 --> 00:16:13.473
The police even told him
about the report I filed.

00:16:13.556 --> 00:16:16.684
Now I can't even see In-yeong anymore.

00:16:17.518 --> 00:16:20.480
Ever since I quit that job,

00:16:20.563 --> 00:16:22.773
I've been having nightmares nonstop.

00:16:22.857 --> 00:16:24.108
I get scared

00:16:24.734 --> 00:16:26.986
whenever the phone rings,

00:16:28.029 --> 00:16:30.490
thinking something
might have happened to In-yeong.

00:16:30.573 --> 00:16:31.949
So, I decided

00:16:32.492 --> 00:16:34.285
to report it to the press…

00:16:36.662 --> 00:16:37.788
but they ignored it.

00:16:41.209 --> 00:16:43.336
The housekeeper
seems to be right about everything.

00:16:43.419 --> 00:16:44.962
It's too early to say for sure.

00:16:45.046 --> 00:16:47.590
For now, all we have are
Ms. Kim's words and a few photos.

00:16:47.673 --> 00:16:49.383
I could see the truth in her eyes.

00:16:49.467 --> 00:16:52.470
- Are we judging the truth by her gaze?
- Why are we judging the truth?

00:16:52.553 --> 00:16:54.430
If things seem suspicious,
we report it first.

00:16:54.514 --> 00:16:56.307
Then we let the law decide.

00:16:56.390 --> 00:16:58.184
What kind of attorney
reports their own client?

00:16:58.267 --> 00:17:00.061
That's a breach of confidentiality

00:17:00.144 --> 00:17:01.771
and grounds for disciplinary action.

00:17:01.854 --> 00:17:03.439
Is that so important to you?

00:17:03.523 --> 00:17:06.734
If breaking the law
bothers you so much, I'll report it.

00:17:06.817 --> 00:17:08.152
Even if I get disciplined--

00:17:08.236 --> 00:17:09.654
Don't be hasty.

00:17:10.363 --> 00:17:11.280
Sorry?

00:17:11.364 --> 00:17:12.782
You may leave.

00:17:13.324 --> 00:17:14.408
Mr. Yoon.

00:17:15.451 --> 00:17:17.328
Do you have any idea

00:17:17.411 --> 00:17:19.914
how anxious I was to tell you
what Mr. Choi did,

00:17:19.997 --> 00:17:21.499
the whole way back to the office?

00:17:21.582 --> 00:17:24.961
I thought you would take immediate action,

00:17:25.461 --> 00:17:27.129
that you wouldn't let him
get away with it.

00:17:27.213 --> 00:17:28.881
Am I a prosecutor?

00:17:28.965 --> 00:17:30.132
Or a judge?

00:17:30.216 --> 00:17:31.175
What kind of action?

00:17:32.009 --> 00:17:35.179
Don't act rashly. Just do your job.

00:17:36.847 --> 00:17:37.848
Go.

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:48.818
Kang Hyo-min!

00:17:52.405 --> 00:17:54.407
You're just a first-year rookie.

00:17:54.490 --> 00:17:56.450
Who do you think you are,
speaking up like that?

00:17:56.534 --> 00:17:59.829
Why did someone like you have to appear
and start stressing me out?

00:17:59.912 --> 00:18:00.788
What…

00:18:01.414 --> 00:18:02.498
What's going on?

00:18:02.582 --> 00:18:03.791
You're the same.

00:18:03.874 --> 00:18:05.543
Is this how you handle first-years?

00:18:05.626 --> 00:18:08.879
Did Kang Hyo-min really go to meet
Mr. Choi's housekeeper by herself?

00:18:10.006 --> 00:18:10.881
Yes.

00:18:11.716 --> 00:18:14.218
What were you thinking,
sending a clueless first-year newcomer

00:18:14.302 --> 00:18:16.137
to handle that alone? You bast…

00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:17.096
Did anything happen?

00:18:17.179 --> 00:18:18.180
Read this.

00:18:18.723 --> 00:18:19.932
Read it!

00:18:23.603 --> 00:18:27.064
One of your attorneys just dropped by.

00:18:27.148 --> 00:18:29.025
You're done now.

00:18:29.108 --> 00:18:31.527
I told her everything,

00:18:31.611 --> 00:18:33.404
and she promised she'd save In-yeong

00:18:33.487 --> 00:18:35.448
and make sure you get punished.

00:18:35.948 --> 00:18:37.325
I'm going all the way.

00:18:37.867 --> 00:18:39.493
Send me the money right now.

00:18:39.577 --> 00:18:40.620
I mean…

00:18:40.703 --> 00:18:42.496
She's a money-hungry woman,

00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:46.417
and you stabbed our client in the back
to give her more ammo!

00:18:47.251 --> 00:18:49.670
Absolutely ridiculous.

00:18:52.423 --> 00:18:53.466
God damn it!

00:19:10.608 --> 00:19:12.318
You big dummy.

00:19:12.401 --> 00:19:14.612
Why are you so down
over something like this?

00:19:16.238 --> 00:19:17.448
Mr. Lee.

00:19:17.531 --> 00:19:19.033
Apparently, Ms. Kim Yeong-suk

00:19:19.116 --> 00:19:21.118
not only went through his wallet

00:19:21.202 --> 00:19:23.913
but also took and sold an expensive watch.

00:19:23.996 --> 00:19:26.999
But Mr. Choi Cheol-min said he'd let it go

00:19:27.083 --> 00:19:28.709
since she took good care of his daughter.

00:19:28.793 --> 00:19:31.712
But in the end,
she even stole from his safe.

00:19:31.796 --> 00:19:34.632
So he told her it was time to quit,

00:19:34.715 --> 00:19:36.050
and she held a grudge

00:19:36.133 --> 00:19:38.761
and threatened to report him

00:19:38.844 --> 00:19:40.763
for child abuse.

00:19:43.057 --> 00:19:44.016
Here.

00:19:45.935 --> 00:19:47.812
I looked into Ms. Kim's criminal record.

00:19:47.895 --> 00:19:49.855
She's a known fraud and thief.

00:19:49.939 --> 00:19:52.108
She didn't strike me as the type.

00:19:53.317 --> 00:19:54.694
This is so tough.

00:19:55.986 --> 00:19:58.030
By the way,

00:19:58.114 --> 00:20:00.157
this won't bankrupt
Choi Cheol-min, will it?

00:20:01.909 --> 00:20:02.785
I mean…

00:20:02.868 --> 00:20:05.746
He owes me some money.

00:20:07.707 --> 00:20:10.459
Gosh, I shouldn't have brought that up.

00:20:10.543 --> 00:20:13.462
You must be busy.
Thank you for stopping by.

00:20:28.686 --> 00:20:29.812
Yes?

00:20:38.237 --> 00:20:41.365
I checked
Ms. Kim Yeong-suk's criminal record.

00:20:43.617 --> 00:20:44.493
I apologize.

00:20:45.119 --> 00:20:47.788
I let my emotions
get the best of me earlier.

00:20:48.414 --> 00:20:50.124
It won't happen again.

00:20:52.835 --> 00:20:56.881
The fact that Ms. Kim
committed theft and fraud in the past

00:20:56.964 --> 00:21:00.885
should not be overinterpreted as proof
that Mr. Choi didn't abuse his daughter.

00:21:01.427 --> 00:21:04.096
Someone who seems bad
can still act out of goodwill,

00:21:04.889 --> 00:21:07.349
while someone who seems good

00:21:08.309 --> 00:21:10.060
may still do harm.

00:21:12.021 --> 00:21:13.731
I'll remember that.

00:21:16.317 --> 00:21:17.193
You may leave.

00:21:18.068 --> 00:21:18.986
Yes, Mr. Yoon.

00:21:42.718 --> 00:21:44.678
You really shouldn't have.

00:21:44.762 --> 00:21:47.139
You didn't need to come
all the way to my house.

00:21:48.682 --> 00:21:50.267
I owe you an apology.

00:21:50.351 --> 00:21:52.019
I should have managed my associate better.

00:21:52.102 --> 00:21:53.354
It's fine.

00:21:53.896 --> 00:21:55.189
We've still got time.

00:21:55.272 --> 00:21:58.776
She's as sly as a snake.
I bet she put on quite the waterworks.

00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:01.320
She's so good at acting.

00:22:01.403 --> 00:22:03.280
You'd get fooled by her too.

00:22:03.364 --> 00:22:05.699
I trust you'll handle it smoothly

00:22:05.783 --> 00:22:09.370
and keep any unnecessary noise
to a minimum, given your competence.

00:22:09.453 --> 00:22:10.329
Sure.

00:22:13.916 --> 00:22:16.001
I didn't want to show up empty-handed,

00:22:16.085 --> 00:22:18.879
so I bought this for your daughter.

00:22:20.923 --> 00:22:21.799
My daughter?

00:22:23.884 --> 00:22:24.760
Ms. Hwang.

00:22:27.555 --> 00:22:28.848
Ms. Hwang!

00:22:29.390 --> 00:22:30.683
Yes, sir.

00:22:32.685 --> 00:22:34.228
Yes.

00:22:34.311 --> 00:22:35.980
What's In-yeong doing now?

00:22:36.605 --> 00:22:38.440
She'll be in her room.

00:23:01.463 --> 00:23:02.882
She's pretty shy.

00:23:05.050 --> 00:23:05.926
Come on.

00:23:06.010 --> 00:23:07.469
Say hi to Dad's friend.

00:23:13.517 --> 00:23:14.602
Say it out loud.

00:23:15.769 --> 00:23:17.521
Hello.

00:23:22.401 --> 00:23:23.402
Hi, In-yeong.

00:23:38.125 --> 00:23:41.253
This is for you.

00:23:45.841 --> 00:23:46.967
What are you doing?

00:23:47.051 --> 00:23:49.386
Say "thank you."

00:23:52.514 --> 00:23:54.516
Say it out loud!

00:23:55.893 --> 00:23:57.603
Thank you.

00:23:58.395 --> 00:23:59.271
Sure.

00:24:17.498 --> 00:24:18.791
Where is her mother?

00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:22.586
I don't want to talk about that bitch.

00:24:24.088 --> 00:24:24.964
I'm playing golf

00:24:25.047 --> 00:24:27.841
with CEO Nam Gyu-cheol
of Namun Group this weekend.

00:24:27.925 --> 00:24:29.218
Care to join us?

00:24:30.052 --> 00:24:31.220
Mr. Nam

00:24:31.303 --> 00:24:34.640
has been struggling lately
with a shareholder derivative lawsuit.

00:24:35.349 --> 00:24:37.142
I put in a good word for you.

00:24:37.226 --> 00:24:39.228
Why don't you discuss it over golf?

00:24:40.187 --> 00:24:41.063
Sure.

00:24:41.647 --> 00:24:43.649
Thank you for your consideration.

00:24:43.732 --> 00:24:44.942
I'll join you.

00:25:00.082 --> 00:25:00.958
Ms. Kang.

00:25:03.168 --> 00:25:04.628
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:25:05.170 --> 00:25:07.256
It was so hard to find this place.

00:25:07.339 --> 00:25:09.717
I'm not used to bustling places like this.

00:25:10.342 --> 00:25:11.510
I see.

00:25:11.593 --> 00:25:13.512
I was told my travel expenses
would be covered.

00:25:13.595 --> 00:25:15.431
We'll pay you after this.

00:25:20.227 --> 00:25:21.311
What's going on?

00:25:22.771 --> 00:25:26.483
Honestly, I'm confused
about what kind of person you are.

00:25:29.319 --> 00:25:33.240
Did he say I'm a thief
with a criminal record?

00:25:35.617 --> 00:25:36.702
Right.

00:25:36.785 --> 00:25:39.747
I didn't come from a good family,
and I married the wrong man.

00:25:39.830 --> 00:25:42.624
That's how I ended up
committing fraud and theft.

00:25:42.708 --> 00:25:46.128
But I'm also the kind of person
who can't just walk past

00:25:46.211 --> 00:25:49.089
a stray cat out in the rain,
hungry and cold.

00:25:49.173 --> 00:25:51.884
I'm only trying to save In-yeong

00:25:51.967 --> 00:25:54.011
from that evil man.

00:25:57.264 --> 00:25:59.224
Are you saying you're not after money?

00:26:01.518 --> 00:26:02.978
Why did you quit the job?

00:26:03.645 --> 00:26:04.855
- That's--
- Didn't you get caught

00:26:04.938 --> 00:26:08.067
by the police while trying
to steal 50 million won in cash

00:26:08.150 --> 00:26:10.527
from Mr. Choi's house?

00:26:10.611 --> 00:26:12.613
That was a trap.

00:26:12.696 --> 00:26:15.282
The moment I heard
the abuse report had been dismissed,

00:26:15.908 --> 00:26:18.952
I knew I had to run away
with his daughter.

00:26:19.036 --> 00:26:20.245
But…

00:26:21.955 --> 00:26:25.584
I had no money, no savings.

00:26:27.127 --> 00:26:28.962
That's when I noticed the safe.

00:26:29.046 --> 00:26:31.381
It had always been locked,

00:26:31.465 --> 00:26:33.425
but it happened to be open that day.

00:26:34.051 --> 00:26:37.346
Just as I left the house
with the money and the girl,

00:26:37.846 --> 00:26:39.389
I was faced with the police.

00:26:41.141 --> 00:26:45.270
But you kept using the abuse
as an excuse to threaten and demand money.

00:26:45.354 --> 00:26:47.481
I was the one who was threatened!

00:26:47.564 --> 00:26:50.109
I live paycheck to paycheck.

00:26:50.192 --> 00:26:52.945
He owed me a month's salary
and didn't even pay my severance.

00:26:53.028 --> 00:26:54.905
I was only asking
for the money I was owed,

00:26:54.988 --> 00:26:56.907
but he turned it around

00:26:56.990 --> 00:27:00.494
and tightened the noose on me!

00:27:08.627 --> 00:27:09.837
What is this?

00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:13.924
This is a complaint outlining the facts
of the defamation and false accusation

00:27:14.007 --> 00:27:16.718
committed by the accused, Kim Yeong-suk.

00:27:19.638 --> 00:27:20.889
What?

00:27:23.809 --> 00:27:25.060
"The accused, Kim Yeong-suk,

00:27:25.144 --> 00:27:27.396
falsely reported to the authorities
that the complainant,

00:27:27.479 --> 00:27:29.565
Choi Cheol-min, had abused
his daughter, Choi In-yeong,

00:27:29.648 --> 00:27:31.483
even though no such abuse had occurred,

00:27:31.567 --> 00:27:34.486
with the intent to extort money
and valuables from him,

00:27:34.570 --> 00:27:36.738
committing the crime of false accusation."

00:27:36.822 --> 00:27:39.324
"The accused, Kim Yeong-suk,
committed the crime of defamation

00:27:39.408 --> 00:27:41.910
by providing false information
to a reporter from Munjin Daily,

00:27:41.994 --> 00:27:43.662
falsely claiming that Choi Cheol-min

00:27:43.745 --> 00:27:45.747
had abused his daughter, Choi In-yeong."

00:27:47.207 --> 00:27:51.336
"The Criminal Act punishes
those who defame others by spreading

00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:54.423
false information through the media

00:27:54.506 --> 00:27:58.093
with up to seven years' imprisonment
or a fine of up to 15 million won."

00:27:58.719 --> 00:28:02.014
This devil really hit In-yeong!

00:28:02.848 --> 00:28:04.141
You piece of trash!

00:28:04.933 --> 00:28:06.101
You bastard!

00:28:06.852 --> 00:28:08.020
Go straight to hell!

00:28:10.272 --> 00:28:13.483
"Under the Criminal Act,
anyone who openly insults another person

00:28:13.567 --> 00:28:14.985
shall be subject to imprisonment

00:28:15.068 --> 00:28:18.780
or detention for up to one year,
or a fine of up to two million won."

00:28:18.864 --> 00:28:20.532
Let me add the charge of insult as well.

00:28:25.204 --> 00:28:27.456
We'll be filing a civil lawsuit too.

00:28:27.539 --> 00:28:29.416
Paying your husband's debt
is already a struggle.

00:28:29.499 --> 00:28:32.794
Fines and damages will
only make things tighter.

00:28:33.378 --> 00:28:35.130
Can you even afford legal representation?

00:28:43.138 --> 00:28:44.640
We'll see you at court, then.

00:28:46.475 --> 00:28:47.935
What is it that you want?

00:28:50.312 --> 00:28:51.396
What do you think?

00:28:55.442 --> 00:28:56.526
Stop stirring the pot.

00:28:57.527 --> 00:29:00.239
You pull a stunt like this again,
and you'll be sorry.

00:29:00.322 --> 00:29:03.116
I'll have you thrown in jail

00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:04.701
for blackmail and extortion.

00:29:12.084 --> 00:29:13.335
COVENANT

00:29:16.838 --> 00:29:17.965
What is this?

00:29:18.048 --> 00:29:19.466
It's a covenant.

00:29:20.509 --> 00:29:23.053
It states that in exchange
for dropping civil and criminal charges,

00:29:23.136 --> 00:29:27.015
you will not
file any false reports about child abuse.

00:29:27.849 --> 00:29:30.018
In case of a breach
resulting in harm to my client,

00:29:30.102 --> 00:29:32.396
you are liable for triple the damages.

00:29:33.647 --> 00:29:35.440
Read it and stamp your agreement.

00:29:58.547 --> 00:30:01.550
PARTY B: KIM YEONG-SUK

00:30:32.789 --> 00:30:34.750
That charisma…

00:30:37.002 --> 00:30:37.961
You were great.

00:30:39.087 --> 00:30:40.714
I should work with you more often.

00:30:40.797 --> 00:30:42.716
You absolutely nailed it.

00:30:44.051 --> 00:30:46.762
I actually have
a few more tricky matters to deal with.

00:30:47.262 --> 00:30:49.431
I'll be in touch with you next week.

00:30:49.514 --> 00:30:50.432
Sure.

00:30:54.978 --> 00:30:55.937
Goodbye.

00:31:57.707 --> 00:32:01.545
You told me not to read too much
into Ms. Kim's past criminal record.

00:32:02.587 --> 00:32:03.964
So why did you?

00:32:04.548 --> 00:32:06.675
Do you do it to pick on the weak

00:32:06.758 --> 00:32:08.552
and protect the powerful?

00:32:11.513 --> 00:32:13.056
Say something.

00:32:13.140 --> 00:32:14.474
Say what?

00:32:14.558 --> 00:32:15.809
Explain yourself.

00:32:15.892 --> 00:32:17.185
Why should I?

00:32:32.951 --> 00:32:34.077
What is it?

00:32:34.161 --> 00:32:35.287
Choi Cheol-min…

00:32:35.829 --> 00:32:37.414
I'll report him myself.

00:32:37.998 --> 00:32:40.876
Will the police fix everything
just because you report it?

00:32:41.501 --> 00:32:43.170
If the case is closed with no charges…

00:32:45.088 --> 00:32:46.590
All we have are photos.

00:32:47.215 --> 00:32:48.508
He brought a doctor to his house

00:32:48.592 --> 00:32:50.802
and framed the housekeeper
to keep her out of the picture.

00:32:50.886 --> 00:32:51.803
He's meticulous.

00:32:51.887 --> 00:32:54.055
Most of the COMO Fund

00:32:54.139 --> 00:32:56.141
came from those in absolute power.

00:32:56.224 --> 00:32:59.269
He launders their money
and grows it legally.

00:33:00.437 --> 00:33:03.815
We can never send that bastard to prison
just for hitting his own daughter.

00:33:04.316 --> 00:33:05.609
If we stir things up,

00:33:05.692 --> 00:33:08.195
and that bastard ends up going back home…

00:33:09.613 --> 00:33:10.947
What happens to the kid?

00:33:51.112 --> 00:33:52.739
I wasn't mad at you, Ms. Kang.

00:33:54.908 --> 00:33:56.243
See you tomorrow.

00:34:16.096 --> 00:34:17.305
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

00:34:17.389 --> 00:34:18.306
Hello.

00:34:25.897 --> 00:34:26.815
Hello.

00:34:26.898 --> 00:34:28.400
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:34:28.483 --> 00:34:29.651
Good morning.

00:35:08.064 --> 00:35:08.940
Hang on.

00:36:27.686 --> 00:36:29.813
Why is he so busy?

00:36:44.577 --> 00:36:46.371
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:37:13.481 --> 00:37:15.275
- Ms. Seo.
- Yes?

00:37:15.358 --> 00:37:17.569
Who are those people?

00:37:18.111 --> 00:37:20.405
I heard they're financial advisors.

00:38:05.784 --> 00:38:06.659
Ms. Seo,

00:38:07.285 --> 00:38:09.829
did Mr. Yoon go somewhere?

00:38:09.913 --> 00:38:13.082
Yes, I was informed
he'll be away for several days.

00:38:13.166 --> 00:38:14.250
I see.

00:38:17.962 --> 00:38:19.255
Good morning.

00:38:22.592 --> 00:38:24.469
What? Why aren't you eating?

00:38:24.552 --> 00:38:25.762
Out with it.

00:38:25.845 --> 00:38:27.138
It's about Mr. Yoon.

00:38:27.222 --> 00:38:28.264
Okay.

00:38:29.933 --> 00:38:31.518
He hasn't been in the office for days.

00:38:31.601 --> 00:38:32.727
And?

00:38:32.811 --> 00:38:33.853
Probably a business trip.

00:38:33.937 --> 00:38:35.104
It's not.

00:38:35.605 --> 00:38:37.774
They say he has business
outside the office.

00:38:38.316 --> 00:38:39.234
Why isn't he back?

00:38:39.317 --> 00:38:41.069
Did something happen to him?

00:38:41.152 --> 00:38:44.239
You should be grateful
your boss isn't showing up to work.

00:38:44.322 --> 00:38:47.575
I went off on him the other day,

00:38:48.243 --> 00:38:50.954
and I'm worried
it may be something to do with that.

00:38:51.037 --> 00:38:51.913
Hello.

00:38:51.996 --> 00:38:54.624
As if he'd even flinch.
You're just a newcomer.

00:38:54.707 --> 00:38:55.667
You're catastrophizing.

00:38:56.584 --> 00:38:58.086
What are you so worried about?

00:39:00.004 --> 00:39:01.172
Don't tell me…

00:39:02.465 --> 00:39:03.466
What?

00:39:03.550 --> 00:39:04.968
You're not, are you?

00:39:05.051 --> 00:39:06.553
Of course not!

00:39:07.262 --> 00:39:08.513
He's my boss, and he's married.

00:39:08.596 --> 00:39:09.597
He even has a kid.

00:39:10.682 --> 00:39:11.683
Right?

00:39:11.766 --> 00:39:13.893
I just thought
maybe you were still shaken up

00:39:13.977 --> 00:39:16.062
because of Han Seong-chan.

00:39:17.063 --> 00:39:18.022
Han Seong-chan…

00:39:18.648 --> 00:39:21.484
How could he have gone on a blind date
before even breaking up properly?

00:39:21.568 --> 00:39:22.443
Enough!

00:39:22.527 --> 00:39:24.195
Is that jerk really worth wasting

00:39:24.279 --> 00:39:26.990
our precious evening on?

00:39:27.615 --> 00:39:28.575
- No.
- No.

00:39:30.827 --> 00:39:31.911
Where could Mr. Yoon be?

00:40:29.552 --> 00:40:30.845
Where could he be?

00:41:13.388 --> 00:41:14.931
Is my chair that comfortable?

00:41:19.602 --> 00:41:20.478
Mr. Yoon!

00:41:22.188 --> 00:41:24.565
Where have you been?
Why weren't you at work?

00:41:24.649 --> 00:41:25.733
Why?

00:41:26.609 --> 00:41:27.485
Did something happen?

00:41:28.277 --> 00:41:29.153
No.

00:41:30.113 --> 00:41:30.989
It's just…

00:41:31.739 --> 00:41:34.534
Must I report my whereabouts
to a newcomer now?

00:41:35.243 --> 00:41:36.661
No, sir.

00:41:36.744 --> 00:41:37.954
I'll go.

00:41:40.373 --> 00:41:41.416
Ms. Kang Hyo-min.

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:43.209
Yes.

00:41:46.170 --> 00:41:47.213
Your eye gunk.

00:41:57.432 --> 00:41:58.433
The office is quiet.

00:41:58.516 --> 00:42:00.852
Everybody's out
on the Pohang business trip.

00:42:07.316 --> 00:42:09.027
- You can go.
- Okay.

00:42:36.095 --> 00:42:37.180
Yes.

00:42:38.973 --> 00:42:40.058
Mr. Yoon.

00:42:40.558 --> 00:42:41.434
Yes?

00:42:41.934 --> 00:42:44.687
This is awkward.

00:42:48.274 --> 00:42:50.359
Did something happen?

00:42:50.985 --> 00:42:51.944
Get this.

00:42:52.028 --> 00:42:55.031
It seems my daughter went out
when I wasn't home.

00:42:56.157 --> 00:42:58.951
And someone must have
reported it to the police.

00:42:59.577 --> 00:43:01.162
The police are in front of my house.

00:43:02.163 --> 00:43:05.666
Man, I am in a bind.

00:43:09.170 --> 00:43:10.171
Did you hit her?

00:43:11.506 --> 00:43:12.882
Why ask? You already know.

00:43:13.466 --> 00:43:15.301
I know you noticed it the other day.

00:43:16.344 --> 00:43:20.264
You knew everything but took it
for the retainer and the big case. Right?

00:43:22.266 --> 00:43:23.142
How is she?

00:43:24.644 --> 00:43:25.603
Not so good.

00:43:27.021 --> 00:43:28.940
I can't let the police see her.

00:43:30.566 --> 00:43:31.901
I'll be right there.

00:43:31.984 --> 00:43:32.985
You will?

00:43:33.694 --> 00:43:34.654
I knew it.

00:43:35.863 --> 00:43:36.823
Thank you.

00:43:46.707 --> 00:43:47.750
Get Mr. Hwang for me.

00:43:47.834 --> 00:43:51.712
His sister gave birth,
so he's in the hospital now.

00:43:52.255 --> 00:43:54.173
I thought he told you about that.

00:43:54.257 --> 00:43:55.424
Is everything okay?

00:43:56.050 --> 00:43:57.051
I can drive.

00:43:58.302 --> 00:43:59.303
Come with me.

00:43:59.387 --> 00:44:00.888
I'll give you the car key.

00:44:00.972 --> 00:44:01.889
Okay.

00:44:19.657 --> 00:44:20.867
Wait here.

00:44:33.337 --> 00:44:34.422
Have you…

00:44:34.922 --> 00:44:35.798
had lunch?

00:44:36.674 --> 00:44:37.550
The police…

00:44:39.135 --> 00:44:40.261
They just left.

00:44:40.887 --> 00:44:43.181
The doorbell rang a few times,
but I didn't answer.

00:44:43.264 --> 00:44:44.432
And they just took off.

00:44:44.515 --> 00:44:46.726
I haven't done anything wrong,

00:44:47.226 --> 00:44:49.896
but why does my heart drop
whenever I see the police?

00:44:52.106 --> 00:44:54.066
I called you for nothing, didn't I?

00:44:55.276 --> 00:44:56.569
Let's take care of this properly.

00:44:56.652 --> 00:44:57.904
What?

00:44:57.987 --> 00:44:59.572
The police could come back.

00:45:00.656 --> 00:45:02.074
We can't let her stay here.

00:45:02.992 --> 00:45:04.535
The child herself is evidence.

00:45:05.578 --> 00:45:06.871
We need to destroy the evidence.

00:45:08.331 --> 00:45:09.248
What?

00:45:10.541 --> 00:45:12.126
Do you want me to kill my daughter?

00:45:13.336 --> 00:45:14.670
I've got a doctor.

00:45:15.713 --> 00:45:17.215
I'll send her back after the treatment.

00:45:19.967 --> 00:45:20.927
Mr. Yoon,

00:45:21.469 --> 00:45:22.678
you sure are sharp!

00:45:22.762 --> 00:45:24.263
Very meticulous.

00:45:25.348 --> 00:45:26.265
Where is she?

00:45:26.974 --> 00:45:28.100
In her room.

00:46:14.397 --> 00:46:15.356
It's okay.

00:46:17.108 --> 00:46:17.984
Come here.

00:46:18.985 --> 00:46:20.278
Let's get out of here.

00:46:46.470 --> 00:46:47.388
I'll get going.

00:46:47.471 --> 00:46:49.640
Okay. Thanks.

00:46:51.851 --> 00:46:52.810
Wait.

00:47:05.614 --> 00:47:07.116
Hey, In-yeong.

00:47:07.199 --> 00:47:09.994
Don't cause any trouble and do as he says.

00:47:11.537 --> 00:47:14.332
Say "yes" when your dad speaks to you.

00:47:14.832 --> 00:47:16.667
Say it out loud!

00:47:16.751 --> 00:47:17.626
Yes.

00:47:17.710 --> 00:47:21.088
Good. There you go.

00:47:28.888 --> 00:47:29.847
You can go.

00:47:33.351 --> 00:47:34.685
I'll call you when it's settled.

00:48:04.924 --> 00:48:05.966
It's okay.

00:48:32.326 --> 00:48:33.244
Let's go.

00:48:35.287 --> 00:48:36.163
Hurry up!

00:48:36.247 --> 00:48:37.206
Okay.

00:48:47.091 --> 00:48:48.884
EMERGENCY ROOM

00:49:01.564 --> 00:49:03.399
- Get ready for surgery.
- Yes, Doctor.

00:49:05.151 --> 00:49:08.028
- What is it?
- Looks like there's mesenteric bleeding.

00:49:21.375 --> 00:49:23.085
OPERATING ROOM

00:49:39.226 --> 00:49:41.479
- How did it go?
- We managed to suture the bleed.

00:49:41.562 --> 00:49:43.522
We just beat the clock.

00:49:44.440 --> 00:49:46.817
The poor child…

00:49:46.901 --> 00:49:49.195
I knew something like this would happen.

00:49:55.117 --> 00:49:56.160
How did you…

00:49:57.495 --> 00:49:58.746
I got a call from him.

00:49:59.413 --> 00:50:00.748
Mr. Yoon?

00:50:02.833 --> 00:50:06.086
The day I stamped the covenant,
he came to me and asked for help.

00:50:06.670 --> 00:50:08.631
He asked for my help and said

00:50:08.714 --> 00:50:12.301
that provoking Choi Cheol-min
could put In-yeong in a worse position.

00:50:12.968 --> 00:50:16.055
He asked a lot of questions
about Choi Cheol-min.

00:50:40.913 --> 00:50:42.081
Please follow that car.

00:51:42.975 --> 00:51:44.184
You piece of shit!

00:51:52.067 --> 00:51:52.943
You're laughing?

00:51:54.153 --> 00:51:55.154
Are you laughing?

00:51:56.905 --> 00:51:57.906
You bastard.

00:52:04.538 --> 00:52:06.498
Even a jerk like you gets to be a parent…

00:52:09.460 --> 00:52:11.128
- Are you laughing?
- Mr. Yoon!

00:52:11.211 --> 00:52:12.713
Get off me!

00:52:15.049 --> 00:52:17.676
Go ahead, asshole. Keep laughing!

00:52:17.760 --> 00:52:19.470
That's enough.

00:52:27.853 --> 00:52:31.065
Damn it! Have you lost your mind,
you bastard?

00:52:31.565 --> 00:52:32.733
Sir,

00:52:33.484 --> 00:52:35.069
how did you know about this?

00:52:36.612 --> 00:52:37.863
Well, shit.

00:52:38.906 --> 00:52:41.116
Go ahead and kill that bastard.

00:52:41.909 --> 00:52:44.411
You're done, asshole!

00:52:44.495 --> 00:52:46.413
You don't know who he is, do you?

00:52:51.877 --> 00:52:52.920
What are you doing?

00:52:53.003 --> 00:52:54.755
What the hell are you doing, you thugs?

00:52:56.882 --> 00:52:58.759
Let go of me, you bastards!

00:52:58.842 --> 00:53:00.886
You nearly beat him to death.

00:53:01.553 --> 00:53:04.973
I thought you called me because
you didn't want to get your hands dirty.

00:53:13.774 --> 00:53:14.775
Make sure…

00:53:17.152 --> 00:53:18.487
you keep your word.

00:53:20.698 --> 00:53:21.615
You too.

00:53:21.699 --> 00:53:23.367
For your own sake.

00:53:24.702 --> 00:53:25.577
Sure.

00:53:26.912 --> 00:53:28.414
I'll get you the data by tomorrow.

00:53:28.497 --> 00:53:29.832
This is enough.

00:53:31.125 --> 00:53:32.960
I could tell Choi Cheol-min

00:53:33.585 --> 00:53:36.922
was skimming my money little by little,

00:53:38.674 --> 00:53:39.883
right under my nose.

00:53:41.427 --> 00:53:43.595
He set up an SPC in the Cayman Islands

00:53:43.679 --> 00:53:46.765
and ran it through a feeder fund,
making everything complex.

00:53:46.849 --> 00:53:49.685
If it weren't for you,
I'd have been in the dark forever.

00:53:50.477 --> 00:53:52.938
I'm a brawler turned businessman.

00:53:53.021 --> 00:53:54.982
That stuff's all gibberish to me.

00:53:55.065 --> 00:53:57.234
But I doubt
you're in this for charity work.

00:53:58.444 --> 00:53:59.445
What do you want?

00:54:03.407 --> 00:54:05.117
This is Choi Cheol-min's daughter.

00:54:05.868 --> 00:54:07.119
She's six years old.

00:54:12.875 --> 00:54:14.626
PHYSICIAN'S STATEMENT

00:54:16.277 --> 00:54:17.629
Is this Choi Cheol-min's doing?

00:54:17.713 --> 00:54:19.839
He even brought
a doctor home to treat her,

00:54:20.674 --> 00:54:22.968
just to keep it all hidden.

00:54:27.848 --> 00:54:29.423
"An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth."

00:54:30.350 --> 00:54:31.977
Help me bring justice to this.

00:54:32.895 --> 00:54:35.856
Then I'll make sure
you get back every penny

00:54:36.774 --> 00:54:37.816
he stole from you.

00:54:49.828 --> 00:54:51.038
You're bleeding…

00:55:20.984 --> 00:55:22.152
Mr. Yoon!

00:57:31.031 --> 00:57:32.199
Mr. Yoon.

00:57:33.241 --> 00:57:34.576
Are you all right?

00:58:02.187 --> 00:58:05.232
Don't you need more treatment?

00:58:09.194 --> 00:58:10.362
I'm good.

00:58:11.363 --> 00:58:12.364
Thank you.

00:58:15.784 --> 00:58:16.868
Don't mention it.

00:58:20.831 --> 00:58:23.083
Even a monster like him
gets to be a parent…

00:58:27.796 --> 00:58:28.714
In-yeong…

00:58:33.844 --> 00:58:35.929
It would have been nice if she were mine.

00:58:39.808 --> 00:58:40.851
I agree.

00:58:42.436 --> 00:58:43.603
I'm sure

00:58:44.271 --> 00:58:46.690
you're a great father.

00:58:48.191 --> 00:58:50.360
How old is your child?

00:58:55.574 --> 00:58:56.575
I don't have a child.

00:58:57.826 --> 00:58:58.702
Pardon?

00:59:00.245 --> 00:59:03.457
Weren't you leaving work early
because you have a child to take care of?

00:59:07.335 --> 00:59:08.545
I'm co-parenting a dog

00:59:09.838 --> 00:59:11.381
with my ex-wife.

00:59:21.058 --> 00:59:22.142
You can go now.

00:59:22.684 --> 00:59:23.769
I'll stay here.

00:59:54.800 --> 00:59:58.261
Choi Cheol-min was hounded by them.

00:59:59.513 --> 01:00:00.639
I'M ON VACATION

01:00:00.722 --> 01:00:02.516
I'LL GET IN TOUCH WHEN I'M BACK

01:00:08.522 --> 01:00:09.397
EDIT PROFILE

01:00:13.401 --> 01:00:15.070
I NEED A BREAK! I'M ON VACATION

01:00:15.153 --> 01:00:17.280
No one around him noticed anything.

01:00:22.327 --> 01:00:23.203
It's okay.

01:00:23.286 --> 01:00:25.413
He got exactly
what he did to his daughter.

01:00:26.540 --> 01:00:28.416
Lex talionis.

01:00:29.626 --> 01:00:31.920
An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.

01:00:41.304 --> 01:00:43.723
The retainer paid by Choi Cheol-min

01:00:43.807 --> 01:00:45.976
was deposited
into In-yeong's trust account.

01:00:46.685 --> 01:00:47.894
How have you been?

01:00:49.020 --> 01:00:52.107
Choi sought medical help
for PTSD and anxiety disorders.

01:00:52.190 --> 01:00:53.150
PHYSICIAN'S STATEMENT

01:00:53.233 --> 01:00:55.902
And in the meantime,
Mr. Yoon Seok-hoon kept his promise

01:00:55.986 --> 01:00:59.614
{\an8}to Hwang Tae-seong and recovered
the money Choi Cheol-min had embezzled.

01:01:00.157 --> 01:01:04.202
{\an8}As a result,
other investors filed lawsuits too,

01:01:04.286 --> 01:01:05.662
{\an8}and Choi Cheol-min went bankrupt.

01:01:06.830 --> 01:01:08.915
{\an8}After that, Choi Cheol-min

01:01:08.999 --> 01:01:11.877
was imprisoned for fraud and embezzlement.

01:01:16.006 --> 01:01:16.923
Custody was granted

01:01:17.007 --> 01:01:20.051
to In-yeong's mother,
who chose to divorce Choi Cheol-min

01:01:20.135 --> 01:01:22.137
after suffering from his domestic abuse.

01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:30.896
Thinking that blood is thicker than water,

01:01:31.521 --> 01:01:34.774
people sometimes turn
a blind eye and a deaf ear to the crimes

01:01:34.858 --> 01:01:36.568
committed by those bound by blood.

01:01:37.903 --> 01:01:39.654
Sometimes, the love of a stranger

01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:41.907
can be deeper and stronger

01:01:43.116 --> 01:01:44.618
than that of family.

01:02:03.303 --> 01:02:05.555
- Hello.
- Hello.

01:02:16.316 --> 01:02:17.484
Mr. Lee!

01:02:17.567 --> 01:02:18.568
Well, someone's excited.

01:02:18.652 --> 01:02:20.070
Are you thrilled to see me?

01:02:20.153 --> 01:02:21.529
Were you bored here alone?

01:02:21.613 --> 01:02:22.989
How was the weather in Pohang?

01:02:23.073 --> 01:02:25.116
I wouldn't know.

01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:26.534
I was working the entire time.

01:02:26.618 --> 01:02:27.911
Have things been okay?

01:02:27.994 --> 01:02:29.329
Things…

01:02:30.288 --> 01:02:31.164
have been okay.

01:02:31.957 --> 01:02:33.333
Good morning.

01:02:33.416 --> 01:02:34.626
You again?

01:02:35.877 --> 01:02:36.753
Mr. Ji.

01:02:36.836 --> 01:02:37.712
Gguk!

01:02:39.381 --> 01:02:41.132
What's this sudden smile?

01:02:42.717 --> 01:02:44.219
It's nice to see you again,

01:02:44.302 --> 01:02:46.054
my law school classmate, Ji Guk-hyeon.

01:02:46.137 --> 01:02:47.555
You're creeping me out.

01:02:47.639 --> 01:02:48.640
What's gotten into you?

01:02:50.183 --> 01:02:52.352
- Hi, Ms. Kang.
- Hello, Ms. Choi.

01:02:52.435 --> 01:02:53.770
Hi, Mr. Oh.

01:02:53.853 --> 01:02:55.438
- Hi.
- Have you been well?

01:02:55.522 --> 01:02:56.690
You must be tired.

01:02:57.440 --> 01:02:59.734
We should go on business trips more often.

01:02:59.818 --> 01:03:01.778
- Why?
- Look how Ms. Kang welcomes us.

01:03:02.570 --> 01:03:03.822
I'm moved.

01:03:03.905 --> 01:03:05.615
- Shall we get to work?
- Sure.

01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:09.327
Mr. Yoon is here.

01:03:43.069 --> 01:03:47.115
We should reinforce this section
on the failure to install safety devices…

01:03:52.162 --> 01:03:53.038
You're flushed.

01:03:58.418 --> 01:04:00.420
Did the rain yesterday give you a cold?

01:04:00.503 --> 01:04:01.671
No.

01:04:02.339 --> 01:04:03.340
Excuse me.

01:04:18.563 --> 01:04:20.106
Have I caught a cold?

01:04:27.322 --> 01:04:28.323
Or maybe not.

01:04:39.751 --> 01:04:41.169
Yes, this is Yoon Seok-hoon.

01:04:44.923 --> 01:04:45.840
Yes.

01:04:52.305 --> 01:04:53.264
Mr. Yoon.

01:04:53.348 --> 01:04:54.391
Later!

01:04:59.020 --> 01:05:00.021
He's busy.

01:05:07.570 --> 01:05:09.823
- I'm here for Hash.
- You can go in.

01:05:12.700 --> 01:05:13.660
What happened?

01:05:14.327 --> 01:05:15.537
It's just an upset stomach.

01:05:16.454 --> 01:05:18.164
What the hell did you feed him?

01:05:20.750 --> 01:05:23.962
He got an injection earlier.
He'll be okay.

01:05:25.505 --> 01:05:26.798
Hash!

01:05:26.881 --> 01:05:28.466
Hey. Stop being a drama queen.

01:05:29.759 --> 01:05:31.052
"Drama queen"?

01:05:31.136 --> 01:05:32.512
What did you just say?

01:05:32.595 --> 01:05:33.555
You heard me.

01:05:33.638 --> 01:05:35.181
Can you keep it down?

01:05:35.265 --> 01:05:36.933
Hash is still…

01:05:39.018 --> 01:05:39.936
Outside. Now.

01:05:43.898 --> 01:05:44.816
Bye.

01:05:46.276 --> 01:05:47.610
What?

01:05:50.613 --> 01:05:52.740
What's your problem? Get it together.

01:05:52.824 --> 01:05:53.783
You get it together.

01:05:53.867 --> 01:05:55.076
I'm watching you.

01:05:55.160 --> 01:05:56.286
I'm watching you too.

01:05:56.369 --> 01:05:57.579
Stop copying me.

01:05:57.662 --> 01:05:59.164
I didn't copy you.

01:05:59.247 --> 01:06:00.123
You childish bastard.

01:06:00.206 --> 01:06:01.583
You childish bastard.

01:06:01.666 --> 01:06:02.625
- Seriously.
- Seriously.

01:06:02.709 --> 01:06:04.544
- Seriously.
- What?

01:06:04.627 --> 01:06:06.629
Are you going to hit me again? Go on!

01:06:06.713 --> 01:06:10.008
Don't you even feel bad for me?

01:06:10.091 --> 01:06:11.259
Feel bad about what?

01:06:11.342 --> 01:06:13.052
I'm thankful that you let Yeon-a go.

01:06:13.136 --> 01:06:14.095
You little…

01:06:14.179 --> 01:06:16.764
Our relationship began
after yours ended properly.

01:06:16.848 --> 01:06:18.016
Why should I feel bad?

01:06:18.099 --> 01:06:19.767
You were always waiting for a chance.

01:06:19.851 --> 01:06:21.311
Cut the crap, will you?

01:06:21.394 --> 01:06:23.229
You know it happened
long after you two split,

01:06:23.313 --> 01:06:25.273
two years later, totally by chance.

01:06:25.356 --> 01:06:27.400
Still, who marries
their high school friend's ex-wife?

01:06:27.484 --> 01:06:28.568
Get the facts straight.

01:06:28.651 --> 01:06:31.946
Yeon-a and I had been friends
long before I knew you.

01:06:32.030 --> 01:06:34.282
Strictly speaking,
I'm Yeon-a's friend, not yours.

01:06:34.365 --> 01:06:35.825
You and I were closer!

01:06:35.909 --> 01:06:36.951
Does it matter?

01:06:38.703 --> 01:06:39.829
Jung Won-jun!

01:06:41.331 --> 01:06:42.707
That's enough.

01:06:43.249 --> 01:06:45.293
It's just that Seok-hoon kept…

01:08:05.331 --> 01:08:08.501
BEYOND THE BAR

01:08:08.585 --> 01:08:09.752
Ms. Kang.

01:08:09.836 --> 01:08:12.755
You should've consulted a senior attorney
before taking on a new case.

01:08:12.839 --> 01:08:14.632
{\an8}You only have a week to prepare.

01:08:14.716 --> 01:08:16.759
{\an8}There's not much I can do for you now.

01:08:16.843 --> 01:08:19.554
{\an8}But you'll prepare the defense
on your own and own the outcome.

01:08:20.221 --> 01:08:21.889
{\an8}- Wake up.
- What an amusing turn.

01:08:21.973 --> 01:08:23.558
{\an8}- And saw a colorful parade--
- Your Honor.

01:08:23.641 --> 01:08:25.893
{\an8}Objection. Leading the witness.

01:08:25.977 --> 01:08:28.938
{\an8}What's the point in asking?
What would a copycat know anyway?

01:08:29.022 --> 01:08:31.399
{\an8}You idiot.

01:08:31.482 --> 01:08:33.276
{\an8}No more screw-ups!

01:08:33.359 --> 01:08:34.652
{\an8}Mr. Yoon!

01:08:35.236 --> 01:08:36.321
Please help me.

01:08:36.404 --> 01:08:38.406
