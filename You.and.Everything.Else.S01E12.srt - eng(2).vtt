00:00:11.594 --> 00:00:13.346
Then do me a favor and back off.

00:00:15.098 --> 00:00:16.641
-What?
-I said back off.

00:00:18.143 --> 00:00:20.311
And stop leading people on.

00:00:21.229 --> 00:00:23.523
How have I been leading people on?

00:00:23.606 --> 00:00:24.607
Song Yu-chan.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:26.901
Kim Sang-hak.

00:00:30.405 --> 00:00:33.283
You're clearly aware,
but you're just enjoying the attention.

00:00:40.582 --> 00:00:41.583
Don't you think

00:00:43.084 --> 00:00:44.669
you're being pathetic?

00:00:47.756 --> 00:00:50.175
If you like him, go and tell him.

00:00:50.675 --> 00:00:52.260
Don't whine to me about it.

00:00:52.343 --> 00:00:53.344
I intend to.

00:00:56.222 --> 00:00:58.391
I just thought that you should know.

00:01:02.353 --> 00:01:03.646
Are we done here?

00:01:24.793 --> 00:01:27.670
You're clearly aware,
but you're just enjoying the attention.

00:01:56.449 --> 00:01:59.244
If you like him, go and tell him.

00:01:59.953 --> 00:02:01.579
Don't whine to me about it.

00:02:25.854 --> 00:02:28.231
Dummy, you call that a confession?

00:02:37.991 --> 00:02:39.784
-Give me that.
-It's not heavy.

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.496
I hope everyone slept well!

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.665
-Did you sleep well?
-I sure did.

00:02:45.748 --> 00:02:46.583
Let's go!

00:02:46.666 --> 00:02:49.210
Hey! We're wearing the same sneakers.

00:02:49.294 --> 00:02:51.212
I got them from Ho-cheol yesterday.

00:02:51.296 --> 00:02:52.964
Producer Cheon actually bought them.

00:02:56.342 --> 00:02:58.428
I thought I was the only lucky one.

00:02:59.304 --> 00:03:01.264
His sneakers looked totally beat-up.

00:03:22.827 --> 00:03:23.953
I said back off.

00:03:24.704 --> 00:03:27.207
And stop leading people on.

00:03:41.221 --> 00:03:42.764
But my eyes keep seeking you out.

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:46.684
I'm falling for you again.

00:03:47.185 --> 00:03:48.853
I'll pretend I didn't hear that.

00:03:49.938 --> 00:03:50.855
Try harder.

00:03:52.857 --> 00:03:54.150
You said you were trying.

00:04:37.652 --> 00:04:41.572
YOU AND EVERYTHING ELSE

00:04:51.582 --> 00:04:53.710
This is the best place so far…

00:04:53.793 --> 00:04:55.128
But it's not perfect, is it?

00:04:55.211 --> 00:04:57.255
Inside and out, it's a little…

00:04:57.338 --> 00:04:59.674
It's harder to scout the hideout
than expected.

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:02.427
There is one other spot,

00:05:02.927 --> 00:05:05.596
but we'd need to shoot
before it's torn down in late July.

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.223
As long as the spot's good…

00:05:07.765 --> 00:05:09.809
We could shoot by late July,
don’t you think?

00:05:09.892 --> 00:05:11.811
Of course we could. Where is it?

00:05:22.488 --> 00:05:23.489
It's great.

00:05:26.117 --> 00:05:28.494
Why didn't you bring us here earlier?

00:05:28.578 --> 00:05:30.663
-Don't you agree, Director?
-You're right.

00:05:30.747 --> 00:05:32.457
I can't believe this still exists.

00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:35.918
It could work well
for the escape scene too.

00:05:36.544 --> 00:05:39.088
Let's go. It's unoccupied,
so we'd be free to explore.

00:05:39.172 --> 00:05:40.840
-It's on the third floor.
-Okay.

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:04.405
Director Kim,
isn't this just what you had in mind?

00:06:04.489 --> 00:06:06.657
A space that feels oppressive.

00:06:07.408 --> 00:06:09.160
Director Gyeong, look here.

00:06:10.244 --> 00:06:11.704
Look at the windowsill.

00:06:12.205 --> 00:06:13.289
I like this spot.

00:06:14.415 --> 00:06:16.292
I really love this place.

00:06:17.293 --> 00:06:19.337
It almost feels like a prison.

00:06:19.921 --> 00:06:22.215
Seeing Ms. Yoon’s home after a decade

00:06:23.216 --> 00:06:24.634
felt even eerier

00:06:25.301 --> 00:06:26.552
than I had anticipated.

00:06:27.428 --> 00:06:29.013
Let's go with the last place.

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:33.476
Why?

00:06:36.854 --> 00:06:38.231
I love this place.

00:06:39.774 --> 00:06:42.026
That place also has
decent outdoor routes, and…

00:06:43.361 --> 00:06:46.531
If we're on the third floor,
lighting could be a challenge.

00:06:48.449 --> 00:06:50.159
I prefer the other spot too.

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:53.830
If it's being demolished in July,
we'd be tight on time.

00:06:53.913 --> 00:06:57.166
As for the indoor scenes,
we can always film on a set.

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:02.046
About the lighting,

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:04.590
it wouldn't be an issue
as we could fit a crane.

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:07.301
Exactly.

00:07:09.303 --> 00:07:10.638
Let's go with this place.

00:07:15.059 --> 00:07:16.727
I quite like

00:07:18.354 --> 00:07:19.605
this place.

00:07:23.317 --> 00:07:25.903
Yes, let's just go with this place.

00:07:27.655 --> 00:07:28.573
Director Kim,

00:07:29.073 --> 00:07:30.074
are you good?

00:07:30.992 --> 00:07:31.826
Yes.

00:07:37.582 --> 00:07:40.126
That place earlier was so gritty.

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:44.881
If you get us a filming permit soon,

00:07:44.964 --> 00:07:47.341
I could prep the spot
before the final walkthrough.

00:07:47.842 --> 00:07:49.969
-I'll try to speed things up.
-Great.

00:07:51.596 --> 00:07:52.555
By the way,

00:07:53.598 --> 00:07:55.099
why did you want to ride with me?

00:07:57.894 --> 00:08:00.521
I just wanted to go with you,
Director Seo.

00:08:02.398 --> 00:08:05.610
So it's not because you feel awkward
around Director Kim?

00:08:07.278 --> 00:08:10.114
You don't really like him, do you?

00:08:10.698 --> 00:08:11.699
Of course not.

00:08:12.492 --> 00:08:14.994
I was just messing around to play along.

00:08:16.829 --> 00:08:18.664
Well, that's too bad.

00:08:18.748 --> 00:08:20.541
GANGNEUNG SE-UN HOSPITAL

00:08:21.834 --> 00:08:24.212
I didn't know
Gangneung had such a big hospital.

00:08:34.347 --> 00:08:35.556
-Good work.
-You too, sir.

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:36.849
Good night, everyone.

00:08:36.933 --> 00:08:38.643
-Good night, sir.
-Good night, sir.

00:08:38.726 --> 00:08:39.810
Good night.

00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:46.984
-Let's all go home.
-Get home safe.

00:08:53.324 --> 00:08:55.159
Wait, isn't that Producer Ryu?

00:08:56.827 --> 00:08:59.288
Should we give her a ride?
Mok-dong is near Ilyeong.

00:09:01.791 --> 00:09:03.167
She'd find that uncomfortable.

00:09:04.544 --> 00:09:06.128
I thought you were her seonbae.

00:09:11.634 --> 00:09:12.677
She's the one

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:15.179
from university…

00:09:17.682 --> 00:09:18.516
She is?

00:09:24.146 --> 00:09:25.356
So is that why you…

00:09:26.774 --> 00:09:29.610
-Pretend you don't know.
-Of course I will.

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:32.989
It all makes sense now.

00:09:34.073 --> 00:09:36.284
So that's why you hesitated
to join Good Man.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.835
It almost feels like a prison.

00:09:46.335 --> 00:09:47.670
-Doesn't it?
-It does.

00:09:51.173 --> 00:09:52.717
Let's go with the last place.

00:10:59.158 --> 00:11:00.326
Hello, everyone.

00:11:00.409 --> 00:11:01.994
-Hello.
-Hello.

00:11:05.539 --> 00:11:08.125
Lucky you. Receiving flowers and all.

00:11:09.168 --> 00:11:12.171
It's from Producer Yu-chan
to celebrate your first day here.

00:11:22.848 --> 00:11:23.891
She did what?

00:11:24.642 --> 00:11:26.977
Did Producer Cheon really ask Kim Sang-hak

00:11:27.061 --> 00:11:29.313
whether he would say yes
if she asked him out?

00:11:29.814 --> 00:11:30.648
Yes.

00:11:31.774 --> 00:11:33.317
And what did he say?

00:11:34.151 --> 00:11:36.237
What do you think? He refused, obviously.

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:37.780
Eun-jung was right there.

00:11:47.164 --> 00:11:49.250
Why are you saying "oh"?

00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:52.211
Ryu Eun-jung!

00:11:52.837 --> 00:11:53.838
I get it now.

00:11:53.921 --> 00:11:54.755
Get what?

00:11:56.340 --> 00:11:59.427
Darn, I think Mr. Park's calling
to ask for another extension.

00:11:59.510 --> 00:12:00.636
I'll see you later.

00:12:01.554 --> 00:12:02.888
Yes, Mr. Park.

00:12:02.972 --> 00:12:04.515
-See ya.
-Yes?

00:12:07.351 --> 00:12:08.310
Song Yu-chan.

00:12:10.312 --> 00:12:13.482
Save the flowers
for your future girlfriend.

00:12:15.317 --> 00:12:17.403
Can't I get you flowers on your first day?

00:12:17.486 --> 00:12:19.655
You can't. Just act like you always have.

00:12:20.156 --> 00:12:22.700
Don't look out for me
or let your feelings grow.

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:24.076
What if I refuse?

00:12:25.578 --> 00:12:26.829
Then we can't be friends.

00:12:27.621 --> 00:12:29.582
Is this because of him? If he had done--

00:12:29.665 --> 00:12:30.833
I have never had

00:12:32.251 --> 00:12:34.170
any romantic feelings for you,

00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:36.130
nor do I ever intend to.

00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:40.885
Damn.

00:12:41.761 --> 00:12:42.803
Kick me while I'm down.

00:12:53.939 --> 00:12:56.692
…and I'm not sure
Yeong-seo's arc feels convincing.

00:12:57.359 --> 00:12:59.069
I'll give it some thought too.

00:13:03.783 --> 00:13:04.617
Wait.

00:13:05.117 --> 00:13:06.702
You're Director Ju, aren't you?

00:13:09.163 --> 00:13:12.291
This is Producer Cheon Sang-yeon,
my co-producer on Good Man.

00:13:13.334 --> 00:13:16.837
I'm sorry I didn't get around
to introducing myself sooner.

00:13:16.921 --> 00:13:18.088
Right.

00:13:18.589 --> 00:13:21.133
Thank you for writing
such a wonderful script.

00:13:21.634 --> 00:13:22.551
Sure.

00:13:23.469 --> 00:13:25.805
I'll see you around. Take care.

00:13:28.849 --> 00:13:31.852
Is she doing that to taunt me,
or is she just shameless?

00:13:32.728 --> 00:13:33.896
Please don't mind her.

00:13:36.524 --> 00:13:37.775
Hello.

00:13:37.858 --> 00:13:39.735
-Hello.
-Hello.

00:13:50.579 --> 00:13:52.998
Did you get a permit
for the test shoot location?

00:13:53.082 --> 00:13:55.209
Yes, we have a lengthy slot from 2:00 p.m.

00:14:05.386 --> 00:14:06.554
It's her, isn't it?

00:14:07.054 --> 00:14:10.432
Cheon Sang-yeon.
The reason you split with Kim Sang-hak.

00:14:13.936 --> 00:14:14.979
So it is her.

00:14:18.774 --> 00:14:19.984
How did you figure it out?

00:14:20.067 --> 00:14:22.653
Well, that's not important.

00:14:23.904 --> 00:14:25.614
But, man,

00:14:25.698 --> 00:14:29.743
you must have felt so uncomfortable
dealing with both her and Kim Sang-hak.

00:14:31.287 --> 00:14:33.122
I hear she still likes Kim Sang-hak.

00:14:34.498 --> 00:14:36.000
Song Yu-chan, that little…

00:14:38.627 --> 00:14:42.172
Whatever. Why should I care
whether she likes him or not?

00:14:42.256 --> 00:14:43.841
Are you sure you don't care?

00:14:44.884 --> 00:14:46.969
Of course I'm sure.

00:14:48.554 --> 00:14:50.639
It obviously bothers you a little.

00:14:52.182 --> 00:14:55.060
I'm just tired of this entire situation.
That's all.

00:14:57.855 --> 00:15:00.608
I must say, it's a shame. Kim Sang-hak.

00:15:01.275 --> 00:15:03.193
He seems like a really decent guy.

00:15:05.404 --> 00:15:06.572
He's a good person.

00:15:15.122 --> 00:15:17.875
Come on, I'm just stating the facts.

00:15:18.626 --> 00:15:20.628
If we were meeting for the first time now,

00:15:21.211 --> 00:15:23.130
I could see myself being attracted to him.

00:15:25.883 --> 00:15:27.468
But I know him already.

00:15:28.052 --> 00:15:29.720
You don't think people can change?

00:15:33.933 --> 00:15:36.518
This isn’t about him at all.

00:15:39.939 --> 00:15:41.440
When we first broke up,

00:15:42.608 --> 00:15:43.984
it was really tough for me.

00:15:45.903 --> 00:15:46.737
At first,

00:15:47.905 --> 00:15:49.573
it was hard not having him there.

00:15:50.407 --> 00:15:51.325
But in the end,

00:15:52.201 --> 00:15:56.038
what really angered me
and was hardest to come to terms with

00:15:56.121 --> 00:15:57.122
was me.

00:15:58.207 --> 00:16:02.169
How I'd gone through someone's drawers
to read their diary.

00:16:03.128 --> 00:16:04.046
You did that?

00:16:04.588 --> 00:16:05.422
Yes.

00:16:07.925 --> 00:16:09.760
I can never erase the memory

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:12.179
of what I did

00:16:13.555 --> 00:16:14.640
and who I became.

00:16:17.351 --> 00:16:19.144
For both of us to be happy,

00:16:19.228 --> 00:16:22.064
I should love who I am when I'm with them.

00:16:23.399 --> 00:16:26.527
Maybe I'm just too self-centered.

00:16:28.445 --> 00:16:29.822
What about Yu-chan?

00:16:30.614 --> 00:16:32.574
Are you sure there's nothing there?

00:16:33.158 --> 00:16:34.493
Hui-jin.

00:16:34.576 --> 00:16:36.120
That sure was fast.

00:16:36.745 --> 00:16:38.831
Ryu Eun-jung, who are you kidding?

00:16:38.914 --> 00:16:40.165
What do you mean?

00:16:40.249 --> 00:16:43.711
You clearly feel differently
about Song Yu-chan and Kim Sang-hak.

00:16:43.794 --> 00:16:45.921
You're definitely bothered
by Kim Sang-hak.

00:16:46.588 --> 00:16:48.048
I am not.

00:16:50.134 --> 00:16:52.511
What are you even… Hui-jin!

00:16:52.594 --> 00:16:54.138
You're hilarious.

00:16:55.139 --> 00:16:56.015
Seriously.

00:16:56.515 --> 00:16:57.975
Here's the new schedule.

00:16:59.226 --> 00:17:00.936
Will the director be at the test shoot?

00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:04.565
No, since the cast won't be there,
and it's just a technical test.

00:17:04.648 --> 00:17:05.816
When will you two arrive?

00:17:05.899 --> 00:17:08.652
In the evening,
just to watch the night shoot.

00:17:08.736 --> 00:17:10.279
I'll be there right after you.

00:17:10.362 --> 00:17:11.697
Okay, see you later.

00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:12.906
Yes, Director Gyeong.

00:17:14.992 --> 00:17:17.202
Okay, will do.

00:17:19.955 --> 00:17:20.831
Hello.

00:17:20.914 --> 00:17:21.749
Hello.

00:17:23.876 --> 00:17:26.670
-Are they filming something here?
-Sorry, we're filming.

00:17:26.754 --> 00:17:28.005
What are you filming?

00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:29.840
Hello, Producer Ryu.

00:17:29.923 --> 00:17:31.008
-Hello.
-Hello.

00:17:31.091 --> 00:17:32.342
Hello, Producer Ryu.

00:17:32.426 --> 00:17:33.844
Where's Producer Cheon?

00:17:33.927 --> 00:17:36.138
She went to the stunt school.
How are things?

00:17:36.221 --> 00:17:37.890
Good. You should say hi to everyone.

00:17:39.141 --> 00:17:41.727
-In front of the camera, please.
-Yes, sir.

00:17:43.103 --> 00:17:44.855
-Hey, you made it.
-Yes.

00:17:48.025 --> 00:17:49.401
Does it look too icy?

00:17:49.485 --> 00:17:50.986
Yes, it does.

00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:52.404
Shall we dial back the blue?

00:17:53.739 --> 00:17:56.742
-We're going to adjust the lighting!
-Understood!

00:18:09.296 --> 00:18:10.714
-Director!
-Producer Ryu!

00:18:10.798 --> 00:18:12.549
-Ryu Eun-jung!
-Are you okay, Director?

00:18:12.633 --> 00:18:13.842
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

00:18:14.718 --> 00:18:16.178
-Seonbae.
-Sang-hak!

00:18:17.221 --> 00:18:19.348
-You're bleeding!
-Oh no!

00:18:19.431 --> 00:18:21.433
-Let's get you to a hospital.
-Let me check.

00:18:21.517 --> 00:18:22.643
It's just a scrape.

00:18:22.726 --> 00:18:25.270
No, we need to get you to a hospital.

00:18:25.354 --> 00:18:26.730
-Just carry on.
-Over there.

00:18:26.814 --> 00:18:27.773
Wait.

00:18:34.154 --> 00:18:35.322
Are you okay?

00:18:38.367 --> 00:18:39.535
Oh no.

00:18:41.537 --> 00:18:43.080
Keep water off the sutures,

00:18:43.163 --> 00:18:45.582
and you can have them removed
in five or six days.

00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:48.127
And absolutely no drinking.

00:18:49.419 --> 00:18:52.548
Sir, she fell with me.
Could you take care of her wound?

00:18:52.631 --> 00:18:55.759
That's all right.
I'll put some cream on it when I get home.

00:18:58.053 --> 00:19:00.806
How could you be so careless?

00:19:00.889 --> 00:19:03.016
The shoot would come to a stop
without you.

00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:05.644
You should remember how important you are.

00:19:06.895 --> 00:19:10.190
It just sort of happened.
I wasn't really thinking.

00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:14.611
Whatever the case, thank you.

00:19:15.112 --> 00:19:15.946
And I'm sorry.

00:19:16.029 --> 00:19:18.991
Don't say that.
It's no big deal, so don't worry.

00:19:22.327 --> 00:19:24.413
Get in. I'll drive you home.

00:19:24.496 --> 00:19:26.206
It's fine. I can take a cab.

00:19:26.290 --> 00:19:28.167
Just go with her.

00:19:29.793 --> 00:19:31.170
I'll be fine on my own.

00:19:32.504 --> 00:19:33.463
Drive safe.

00:19:59.531 --> 00:20:02.659
It just sort of happened.
I wasn't really thinking.

00:20:03.827 --> 00:20:05.495
Whatever the case, thank you.

00:20:05.996 --> 00:20:07.039
And I'm sorry.

00:20:16.632 --> 00:20:18.133
Director Kim got hurt?

00:20:21.845 --> 00:20:22.679
Yes.

00:20:23.222 --> 00:20:24.431
He needed five stitches

00:20:25.098 --> 00:20:27.517
and should rest his shoulders
for the time being.

00:20:28.101 --> 00:20:29.186
Is he resting up now?

00:20:29.269 --> 00:20:32.147
No, he went to Chuncheon
to scout a lab location.

00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:34.650
Wasn't that called off?

00:20:34.733 --> 00:20:38.779
He told Ho-cheol he had to go
since rescheduling wasn't an option.

00:20:38.862 --> 00:20:40.614
Goodness, that guy…

00:20:54.544 --> 00:20:56.630
Here's your schedule.

00:21:00.175 --> 00:21:03.345
I hear Director Kim and Producer Ryu
were really something yesterday.

00:22:19.087 --> 00:22:20.130
How did you…

00:22:33.268 --> 00:22:35.103
I like you, seonbae.

00:22:39.608 --> 00:22:41.401
Ever since I was 17…

00:22:44.321 --> 00:22:46.782
until now, I have always liked you.

00:22:50.035 --> 00:22:52.871
What I said about liking Uncle Tat
was all a lie.

00:22:56.083 --> 00:22:58.960
It was always Kim Sang-hak,
and I have never

00:23:00.087 --> 00:23:02.089
felt this way about anyone else.

00:23:07.803 --> 00:23:11.264
-Sang-yeon.
-Why did you have to show up again?

00:23:14.851 --> 00:23:17.771
Why did you have to show up
and stir up all these feelings?

00:23:22.109 --> 00:23:23.318
I like someone else.

00:23:23.402 --> 00:23:24.403
Eun-jung?

00:23:28.824 --> 00:23:30.700
Eun-jung doesn't like you.

00:23:33.829 --> 00:23:35.705
She has no interest in you.

00:23:37.416 --> 00:23:38.333
I know.

00:23:40.919 --> 00:23:41.795
Then why?

00:23:43.713 --> 00:23:44.840
Why?

00:23:46.091 --> 00:23:48.593
What is it about her
that you like so much?

00:23:51.221 --> 00:23:53.181
I'm also hoping that this will pass.

00:23:55.934 --> 00:23:57.352
You should do the same.

00:23:59.312 --> 00:24:02.441
Just focus on your work and let this pass.

00:24:05.402 --> 00:24:06.987
You said not to set myself aflame.

00:24:11.741 --> 00:24:13.743
Why did you bother messaging me that?

00:24:13.827 --> 00:24:17.622
If you hadn't said that,
I would be gone by now, burned to ashes.

00:24:23.962 --> 00:24:25.172
You may find it easy

00:24:26.715 --> 00:24:28.508
to let things pass…

00:24:32.137 --> 00:24:33.346
but not me.

00:24:38.393 --> 00:24:40.395
I'm here today because of you.

00:24:42.981 --> 00:24:44.149
All I wanted

00:24:45.233 --> 00:24:47.360
was for you to thrive.

00:24:48.236 --> 00:24:49.362
I felt so bad for you.

00:24:49.446 --> 00:24:51.281
I don't care what it was.

00:24:52.741 --> 00:24:55.785
Eun-jung has many people she loves

00:24:55.869 --> 00:24:57.537
and people who love her back.

00:25:00.624 --> 00:25:02.792
But you're all I have.

00:25:05.337 --> 00:25:06.379
So…

00:25:09.925 --> 00:25:12.260
can't you just give me a chance?

00:25:18.892 --> 00:25:19.893
I'm sorry.

00:25:24.105 --> 00:25:25.148
Get home safe.

00:25:30.904 --> 00:25:31.947
Why?

00:25:32.447 --> 00:25:34.366
Why can't it be me?

00:26:07.524 --> 00:26:08.942
My stitches come out tomorrow.

00:26:09.609 --> 00:26:10.944
Is your shoulder better?

00:26:11.027 --> 00:26:11.945
Totally.

00:26:17.158 --> 00:26:18.702
Director Kim, are you okay?

00:26:18.785 --> 00:26:20.704
-Director Kim.
-Welcome back!

00:26:20.787 --> 00:26:22.163
Please get back to work.

00:26:30.005 --> 00:26:31.423
Good work, everyone.

00:26:31.506 --> 00:26:33.091
-You too, sir.
-Great work.

00:26:36.803 --> 00:26:37.929
Are you okay to drink?

00:26:39.681 --> 00:26:41.474
Producer Ryu, you're shooting daggers.

00:26:41.975 --> 00:26:43.893
It's just that the doctor said…

00:26:43.977 --> 00:26:46.104
He's fine. It's almost been a week.

00:26:50.358 --> 00:26:52.235
You're unusually quiet today.

00:26:55.405 --> 00:26:57.907
How's the storyboard coming along?
When can we expect it?

00:26:57.991 --> 00:27:01.119
I'm just finishing up the ending,
so I should be done in two days.

00:27:01.202 --> 00:27:03.163
Producer Ryu, I forgot to tell you.

00:27:03.246 --> 00:27:05.540
I might change
Tae-o's last words to Su-jin

00:27:05.624 --> 00:27:06.875
to "So it was you."

00:27:06.958 --> 00:27:08.251
What do you think?

00:27:10.086 --> 00:27:11.588
"So it was you."

00:27:15.508 --> 00:27:16.551
It feels so tragic.

00:27:17.385 --> 00:27:18.762
It was Director Kim's idea.

00:27:21.389 --> 00:27:23.058
It just came to mind.

00:27:23.725 --> 00:27:26.019
You two really seem to think alike.

00:27:26.519 --> 00:27:29.898
Wouldn't anyone agree
that it's a great line?

00:27:38.156 --> 00:27:39.074
I'm taking a cab.

00:27:39.157 --> 00:27:40.116
Me too.

00:27:40.867 --> 00:27:42.827
I'll see you at the ritual, then.

00:27:42.911 --> 00:27:44.412
Yes, I'll be in touch.

00:27:44.496 --> 00:27:45.497
Take care.

00:27:51.086 --> 00:27:52.253
You should go first.

00:27:52.962 --> 00:27:54.798
Because the filming crew should go first?

00:27:56.132 --> 00:27:57.300
No.

00:27:58.551 --> 00:27:59.761
Shall we walk a bit?

00:28:02.639 --> 00:28:03.473
Sure.

00:28:24.994 --> 00:28:27.956
How did you come up with that line?

00:28:28.456 --> 00:28:30.125
It just came to me.

00:28:30.917 --> 00:28:32.711
It's nice to hear that everyone likes it.

00:28:33.712 --> 00:28:37.465
This is huge.
We're talking about Tae-o's final words.

00:28:38.133 --> 00:28:40.552
How did you decide to go to film school?

00:28:42.137 --> 00:28:44.764
Just while I was watching films
to pass time.

00:28:46.224 --> 00:28:49.394
Now that I think about it,
I suppose I owe a bit of that to you.

00:28:49.477 --> 00:28:50.437
How so?

00:28:51.020 --> 00:28:52.021
Back then,

00:28:52.689 --> 00:28:54.899
I wrote these super long diary entries.

00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:58.486
I drew from those entries
to pass my practical exam.

00:29:04.242 --> 00:29:06.286
So you should be thanking me.

00:29:07.036 --> 00:29:08.079
How ridiculous.

00:29:11.166 --> 00:29:12.751
I got into film, thanks to you.

00:29:13.501 --> 00:29:16.296
As if. You've always liked films.

00:29:16.796 --> 00:29:18.923
I never considered it as a career though.

00:29:19.549 --> 00:29:22.469
But then I heard
that you were at film school.

00:29:24.804 --> 00:29:25.805
Really?

00:29:27.182 --> 00:29:28.892
So you copied me?

00:29:29.559 --> 00:29:32.854
That's not copying.
It’s called being inspired.

00:29:32.937 --> 00:29:35.064
It sounds pretty similar to me.

00:29:35.148 --> 00:29:38.651
I believe you should be the one
saying "thank you," instead.

00:29:40.528 --> 00:29:41.780
Thank you.

00:29:45.784 --> 00:29:46.993
This is nice.

00:29:47.994 --> 00:29:49.537
I guess Mom was right.

00:29:50.163 --> 00:29:54.000
She always reminds me
that not everything bad is all bad.

00:29:58.004 --> 00:29:59.631
I still wish it hadn't happened.

00:30:01.257 --> 00:30:03.343
Forget it. That was ages ago.

00:30:05.637 --> 00:30:07.096
I can't help but wonder…

00:30:09.098 --> 00:30:12.769
"What if we were meeting
for the first time?"

00:30:18.817 --> 00:30:20.360
I want to start over,

00:30:21.444 --> 00:30:22.904
as if we just met.

00:30:35.375 --> 00:30:38.545
Producer Cheon, here’s
the final attendance list for the ritual.

00:30:41.089 --> 00:30:44.801
Does this include the guests
of our executive and division head?

00:30:44.884 --> 00:30:45.844
Of course.

00:30:46.719 --> 00:30:47.971
GOOD MAN RITUAL ATTENDEES

00:30:48.054 --> 00:30:50.098
SCRIPTWRITER JU DONG-HYANG
NOT ATTENDING

00:30:54.727 --> 00:30:57.230
Will you be checking on the set later?

00:30:57.313 --> 00:30:58.815
Will you not be joining me?

00:30:58.898 --> 00:31:01.818
I'll join at 4:00 p.m.
for Lee Seung-jae's wardrobe fitting.

00:31:01.901 --> 00:31:02.777
Okay, got it.

00:31:08.408 --> 00:31:09.576
Yes, Director.

00:31:10.326 --> 00:31:11.619
I'll be right up.

00:31:13.121 --> 00:31:14.122
All right.

00:31:14.664 --> 00:31:18.459
Sir, we can't let you in
if your contact won't answer your calls.

00:31:18.543 --> 00:31:21.296
But she never answers my calls!
Okay, fine.

00:31:22.255 --> 00:31:24.215
Here. Can you make a call for me?

00:31:24.299 --> 00:31:25.717
Cheon Sang-yeon, 010…

00:31:26.301 --> 00:31:27.802
-3277…
-Sir, please.

00:31:27.886 --> 00:31:30.680
-Please go.
-It's not like it costs anything.

00:31:31.848 --> 00:31:33.057
Watch it.

00:31:33.141 --> 00:31:34.475
I'm sorry, sir.

00:31:34.559 --> 00:31:36.144
-Be careful.
-What is it, Dad?

00:31:38.187 --> 00:31:39.939
She never answers her phone.

00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:43.026
Cheon Sang-yeon!

00:31:43.109 --> 00:31:45.361
-Sir, please--
-I'll talk to him.

00:31:45.445 --> 00:31:47.697
Sir, shall we talk outside?

00:31:48.865 --> 00:31:50.825
-Do you know my daughter?
-I'm her colleague.

00:31:50.909 --> 00:31:52.201
-Is that so?
-Yes.

00:31:52.702 --> 00:31:54.913
Can I get a business card, then?

00:31:54.996 --> 00:31:57.123
-She never answers.
-She doesn't?

00:31:59.083 --> 00:32:00.209
Hey, she's here.

00:32:00.293 --> 00:32:01.586
Is that Producer Cheon?

00:32:01.669 --> 00:32:04.005
-I don't think she knows yet.
-I feel sorry for her.

00:32:05.506 --> 00:32:06.841
You're back.

00:32:06.925 --> 00:32:07.800
Hey.

00:32:12.555 --> 00:32:14.265
I thought she came from money.

00:32:14.766 --> 00:32:16.601
How can her dad behave that way?

00:32:17.101 --> 00:32:19.437
You must know
since you're childhood friends.

00:32:20.104 --> 00:32:22.649
I can't believe she had us all fooled.

00:32:23.399 --> 00:32:24.817
Who did she fool exactly?

00:32:25.485 --> 00:32:28.404
Has she ever claimed
to come from a wealthy background?

00:32:29.405 --> 00:32:33.576
And why is her background
any of your business, Producer Kim?

00:32:35.286 --> 00:32:38.206
Are you getting mad at me?
I was only asking a question--

00:32:38.289 --> 00:32:39.916
Well, don't.

00:32:39.999 --> 00:32:42.794
Please just stay out
of other people's business.

00:32:43.294 --> 00:32:46.339
You've let producing that film
go to your head--

00:32:48.633 --> 00:32:50.343
It's been a while, Producer Cheon.

00:32:56.265 --> 00:32:58.393
I told him not to come here again…

00:33:00.645 --> 00:33:02.146
but I have a feeling he will.

00:33:05.566 --> 00:33:06.526
So

00:33:07.318 --> 00:33:09.362
I think you should at least call him.

00:33:16.494 --> 00:33:17.996
Let's go inside together.

00:33:20.123 --> 00:33:21.124
You go ahead.

00:33:29.382 --> 00:33:30.883
It'll pass in a day.

00:33:33.136 --> 00:33:34.554
Don't mind the others.

00:33:51.070 --> 00:33:52.071
Producer Cheon.

00:33:52.905 --> 00:33:55.700
Would you like to see the speech
Producer Oh wrote?

00:33:58.995 --> 00:34:00.538
Did you write this yourself?

00:34:05.793 --> 00:34:07.211
This should get some laughs.

00:34:14.010 --> 00:34:15.470
I want to start over…

00:34:19.515 --> 00:34:20.892
as if we just met.

00:34:24.437 --> 00:34:26.147
Just give me one more chance.

00:34:27.648 --> 00:34:28.941
If we can't work it out…

00:34:31.277 --> 00:34:32.945
I'll do whatever you ask.

00:34:36.157 --> 00:34:37.033
I truly

00:34:38.034 --> 00:34:39.660
didn’t want to be swayed.

00:34:41.454 --> 00:34:42.455
And yet

00:34:44.373 --> 00:34:46.375
I couldn’t find the words to respond.

00:34:49.879 --> 00:34:51.339
What are you thinking about?

00:34:52.381 --> 00:34:53.508
About your dad?

00:34:54.884 --> 00:34:56.177
I got rejected.

00:34:57.178 --> 00:35:00.973
I took your advice and confessed,
only to get brutally rejected.

00:35:04.936 --> 00:35:07.188
Well done. Is everything clearer now?

00:35:09.148 --> 00:35:10.149
Not at all.

00:35:11.984 --> 00:35:14.529
I guess I'm an idiot
for taking your advice.

00:35:16.030 --> 00:35:17.406
Why don't you date me instead?

00:35:20.326 --> 00:35:22.411
Why? Is it because I’m married?

00:35:23.162 --> 00:35:24.622
But I’m such a charmer.

00:35:25.289 --> 00:35:28.084
But you aren't much of a charmer to me.

00:35:28.167 --> 00:35:29.752
That's precisely how he feels.

00:35:31.170 --> 00:35:34.632
He simply isn't drawn to you,
as charming as you are.

00:35:36.342 --> 00:35:38.136
It's about time you stopped suffering.

00:35:38.219 --> 00:35:40.888
Find a guy
who's actually worthy of your affection.

00:35:45.643 --> 00:35:46.602
I want that too.

00:35:47.103 --> 00:35:49.438
If only my heart would cooperate.

00:35:55.069 --> 00:35:56.988
On June 10th, the Year of the Black Snake,

00:35:57.822 --> 00:36:02.493
Good Man's Director Gyeong Seung-ju
and all associates are gathered here

00:36:02.994 --> 00:36:06.080
to earnestly pray
to the gods of heaven and earth.

00:36:07.290 --> 00:36:10.585
Please look after us
from the presence of all evil demons.

00:36:10.668 --> 00:36:12.253
WISHING FOR GOOD MAN'S SAFETY AND SUCCESS

00:36:12.336 --> 00:36:14.630
The demon of schedule cancellations,

00:36:15.298 --> 00:36:17.049
the demon of fickle weather,

00:36:17.758 --> 00:36:19.135
the demon of retakes,

00:36:20.303 --> 00:36:22.763
the demon of tardiness,
and the demon of accidents.

00:36:23.264 --> 00:36:25.349
Please send them all far, far away…

00:36:38.112 --> 00:36:39.697
Please head inside.

00:36:39.780 --> 00:36:41.073
The room in the middle.

00:36:43.117 --> 00:36:44.869
-The one in the middle.
-Okay.

00:36:45.578 --> 00:36:48.372
-Director Gyeong, please head on inside.
-Great.

00:36:51.375 --> 00:36:53.044
-This way.
-The middle room.

00:36:56.589 --> 00:36:58.216
Ever been in the ocean in February?

00:36:58.299 --> 00:37:00.051
No, why would I?

00:37:00.134 --> 00:37:02.178
It feels like utter death.

00:37:02.261 --> 00:37:04.680
The water is even colder than in January,

00:37:06.307 --> 00:37:09.143
but they told me to get in
wearing a thin-ass T-shirt.

00:37:31.123 --> 00:37:33.334
Can we chat after this?

00:37:34.543 --> 00:37:36.420
I'll wait for you at the café out front.

00:37:37.255 --> 00:37:38.339
Sure.

00:37:50.643 --> 00:37:51.727
Producer Cheon!

00:37:52.436 --> 00:37:54.563
Come here. Come on.

00:37:55.064 --> 00:37:57.733
Seung-jae insists
it's only fun when you're around.

00:37:59.151 --> 00:38:00.027
You said that?

00:38:00.528 --> 00:38:02.446
How exactly do I make things fun?

00:38:03.114 --> 00:38:05.116
The way you read my mind
with just a glance.

00:38:07.159 --> 00:38:07.994
Bottoms up.

00:38:18.879 --> 00:38:21.507
-You're really going for it today.
-Shall we toast?

00:38:21.590 --> 00:38:23.426
-Let's clink glasses together.
-Okay.

00:38:23.509 --> 00:38:25.428
-Cheers to Good Man.
-Cheers!

00:38:25.511 --> 00:38:27.847
-I look forward to working with you.
-Thank you.

00:38:33.227 --> 00:38:34.687
The alcohol is sweet today.

00:38:37.982 --> 00:38:39.066
-Goodbye.
-Go ahead.

00:38:39.150 --> 00:38:40.318
-I'm off.
-Go on.

00:38:40.860 --> 00:38:41.736
Go get some rest.

00:38:41.819 --> 00:38:43.279
Let me join you.

00:38:47.325 --> 00:38:49.535
I'll be at the café. Take your time.

00:39:07.053 --> 00:39:08.220
Hey, are you okay?

00:39:09.513 --> 00:39:10.514
Cheon Sang-yeon.

00:39:11.223 --> 00:39:12.224
Are you drunk?

00:39:14.602 --> 00:39:15.686
Whoa, hey!

00:39:16.187 --> 00:39:17.188
Sang-yeon.

00:39:18.022 --> 00:39:19.190
Hey, wake up.

00:39:20.941 --> 00:39:23.277
-Where's her bag?
-I have everything here.

00:39:23.361 --> 00:39:24.612
-It's over that way.
-Okay.

00:39:24.695 --> 00:39:26.489
Sang-yeon, please wake up.

00:39:27.198 --> 00:39:28.199
God, seriously.

00:39:32.495 --> 00:39:34.246
Careful. Gently.

00:39:41.921 --> 00:39:42.922
Thank you.

00:39:43.005 --> 00:39:45.007
-I'll go now. Don't come out.
-Okay.

00:39:45.091 --> 00:39:46.425
What is this noise?

00:39:48.677 --> 00:39:49.804
Goodness, Sang-hak?

00:39:51.055 --> 00:39:52.890
Mom, we'll talk later.

00:39:53.682 --> 00:39:54.517
Go on home.

00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:55.935
I'll be leaving, ma'am.

00:39:56.435 --> 00:39:58.687
-Good night.
-Go on. Get home safe.

00:40:01.816 --> 00:40:04.151
How much alcohol did you give her?

00:40:04.235 --> 00:40:06.362
It was just for work.

00:40:06.445 --> 00:40:08.239
Just go back to bed.

00:40:08.322 --> 00:40:09.198
Drink this.

00:40:09.907 --> 00:40:11.409
This one’s for Sang-yeon.

00:40:11.492 --> 00:40:13.577
Really, if she was drinking so much,

00:40:13.661 --> 00:40:15.246
you should have stopped her.

00:40:15.746 --> 00:40:18.082
Do you think she would have listened?

00:40:18.165 --> 00:40:19.875
No one told her to drink so much!

00:40:19.959 --> 00:40:21.794
-Drink it.
-She's sleeping!

00:40:21.877 --> 00:40:23.003
She can't be.

00:40:23.879 --> 00:40:25.172
She's sleeping.

00:40:25.256 --> 00:40:26.382
Go in and check.

00:40:50.906 --> 00:40:51.782
Sang-yeon.

00:40:56.704 --> 00:40:58.622
See? I told her she's asleep.

00:41:15.347 --> 00:41:16.390
Don't go.

00:41:25.774 --> 00:41:27.318
I'm in love with him.

00:41:36.452 --> 00:41:37.536
So please…

00:41:40.789 --> 00:41:41.957
don't go to him.

00:45:22.594 --> 00:45:27.599
