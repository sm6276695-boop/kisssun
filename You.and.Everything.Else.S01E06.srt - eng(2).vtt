00:00:14.597 --> 00:00:15.724
It was you, wasn't it?

00:00:18.351 --> 00:00:19.644
You're the one…

00:00:22.313 --> 00:00:23.982
who replied to me as Moonee.

00:00:34.868 --> 00:00:36.411
It never even crossed my mind that…

00:00:39.372 --> 00:00:40.874
that could happen to him.

00:01:09.736 --> 00:01:11.905
Did you perhaps see that photo?

00:01:15.366 --> 00:01:18.995
The photo of a woman sitting on a bench.

00:01:20.121 --> 00:01:21.164
Yes.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.708
Do you know her too?

00:01:24.793 --> 00:01:27.545
We called her "Dylan."
She was a fellow club member.

00:01:29.714 --> 00:01:32.133
Could you help me meet with her?

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.679
Sure, but it's been a while
since we last spoke.

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.432
I'll see if anyone is still in touch.

00:01:41.059 --> 00:01:41.893
Thank you.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.229
Why do you want to meet her?

00:01:47.982 --> 00:01:51.111
I want to ask her something
about my brother.

00:01:51.194 --> 00:01:54.197
I think she might know the answer.

00:01:56.407 --> 00:01:59.035
It's a green light.
I'll get going, then. Take care.

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:01.538
Right. Take care.

00:02:49.335 --> 00:02:52.463
I think it might be a first for her,

00:02:53.381 --> 00:02:57.468
opening up to someone about that.

00:03:22.827 --> 00:03:23.661
Hey.

00:03:23.745 --> 00:03:24.621
Hey.

00:03:26.247 --> 00:03:27.248
Have you eaten?

00:03:27.332 --> 00:03:28.583
I have.

00:03:31.252 --> 00:03:32.879
I acted silly earlier, didn't I?

00:03:34.505 --> 00:03:37.550
Something urgent came up.

00:03:43.223 --> 00:03:45.642
I know it was because of your brother.

00:03:49.187 --> 00:03:52.690
Sang-hak seonbae told me.
He said that he was with you just now.

00:03:57.278 --> 00:03:58.655
Word travels fast.

00:04:00.365 --> 00:04:02.867
It sure didn't take him long
to report back to you.

00:04:09.332 --> 00:04:10.625
You're okay, right?

00:04:14.754 --> 00:04:15.922
Of course I am.

00:04:19.175 --> 00:04:21.970
I was doing you both a favor
by giving you some privacy.

00:04:22.595 --> 00:04:24.764
You should be thanking me.

00:04:26.224 --> 00:04:29.394
Don't you worry. We always make time
to enjoy each other's company.

00:04:30.353 --> 00:04:31.479
I'm well aware.

00:04:36.276 --> 00:04:40.280
He… seemed pretty shocked.

00:04:44.033 --> 00:04:45.243
Yeah, he did.

00:04:46.828 --> 00:04:48.288
It must have shocked you too.

00:04:48.788 --> 00:04:52.583
Who would have thought
that he knew your brother?

00:04:55.586 --> 00:04:58.589
Yeah, I was just as shocked.

00:04:59.674 --> 00:05:01.592
I can't quite believe it either.

00:05:05.763 --> 00:05:08.558
If you're hungry,
there's pizza on the dining table.

00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:10.226
I told you I ate.

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:15.023
But thanks.

00:05:15.732 --> 00:05:16.649
Good night.

00:05:58.983 --> 00:06:02.904
YOU AND EVERYTHING ELSE

00:06:02.987 --> 00:06:05.323
What I find so strange

00:06:05.823 --> 00:06:09.077
is how, despite being so close,
you didn't know each other's names.

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:11.079
He never told us.

00:06:12.038 --> 00:06:14.207
Everyone called each other
by their usernames,

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:17.585
but over time, we learned
each other's real names and schools.

00:06:18.086 --> 00:06:20.838
But no one knew anything about Moonee
until the very end.

00:06:21.339 --> 00:06:23.883
There is one person who may have known.

00:06:25.051 --> 00:06:26.386
Anyway, that was just him.

00:06:27.053 --> 00:06:31.224
That does sound like him,
considering his personality and all.

00:06:33.017 --> 00:06:37.522
It's still so weird to think…
that he was also called Sang-hak.

00:06:43.194 --> 00:06:44.737
What are the odds?

00:06:45.363 --> 00:06:47.949
Do you want a Big Mac for lunch tomorrow?

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:53.204
Meaningful? How do you eat
a Big Mac meaningfully?

00:06:54.247 --> 00:06:55.331
What?

00:06:57.208 --> 00:06:59.627
How does that make it meaningful?

00:07:00.962 --> 00:07:02.088
You're so silly.

00:07:03.548 --> 00:07:06.551
We could go for two, maybe three burgers.

00:07:07.093 --> 00:07:09.053
Let's go to Burger King right after.

00:07:34.162 --> 00:07:37.498
Just in case you missed dinner. Enjoy.

00:07:46.632 --> 00:07:48.050
Hi, Uncle Tat.

00:07:49.218 --> 00:07:51.179
I am doing well.

00:07:52.638 --> 00:07:55.308
We can't meet right now,

00:07:56.392 --> 00:07:59.479
but I'm doing really well.

00:08:02.773 --> 00:08:03.649
Hi…

00:08:05.651 --> 00:08:06.652
Uncle Tat.

00:08:08.154 --> 00:08:10.072
Hi, Uncle Tat.

00:08:13.451 --> 00:08:16.120
You like Stephen Chow movies, don't you?

00:08:17.371 --> 00:08:19.290
I really like his films too.

00:08:42.021 --> 00:08:46.817
A CHINESE ODYSSEY
STARRING STEPHEN CHOW

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:50.154
A CHINESE ODYSSEY 2

00:09:00.831 --> 00:09:02.875
-Hey, Sang-yeon.
-Hey.

00:09:14.178 --> 00:09:15.096
Hello, seonbae.

00:09:17.473 --> 00:09:19.141
No, I'm done with classes today.

00:09:21.477 --> 00:09:22.520
Really?

00:09:30.444 --> 00:09:32.029
These are the ones?

00:09:32.113 --> 00:09:36.158
Yes. These are the tapes
in that photograph.

00:09:36.659 --> 00:09:39.954
He lent them to me,
and I guess I'm finally returning them.

00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:45.334
They star Stephen Chow.
Have you seen them?

00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:47.336
No.

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:49.839
Give them a go. Your brother liked them.

00:09:50.631 --> 00:09:52.633
They're really funny but also sad.

00:09:54.093 --> 00:09:56.637
Did you know my username
comes from these movies?

00:09:59.807 --> 00:10:02.268
I owe my friendship with your brother
to Stephen Chow.

00:10:02.893 --> 00:10:05.771
It was the topic
of our very first conversation.

00:10:06.689 --> 00:10:10.610
Hi, Uncle Tat.
You like Stephen Chow movies, don't you?

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:15.531
My username "Moonee" is the Korean name
of the actress Mo Wenwei.

00:10:16.282 --> 00:10:20.745
Wait, Mo Wenwei?
And not Moonee, as in the moon?

00:10:20.828 --> 00:10:23.914
No, not the moon, but Mo Wenwei.

00:10:25.041 --> 00:10:27.710
He came up with it after seeing her
in A Chinese Odyssey.

00:10:28.544 --> 00:10:29.670
I see.

00:10:29.754 --> 00:10:34.175
As for Dylan's number, I've asked a guy
from the club who's well-connected.

00:10:34.258 --> 00:10:35.259
Let's wait and see.

00:10:38.471 --> 00:10:39.305
Thank you.

00:10:41.057 --> 00:10:44.769
You don't need to thank me.
I'm just as curious about him as you are.

00:10:47.396 --> 00:10:48.230
Still, thanks.

00:10:49.023 --> 00:10:51.942
-Where's your boyfriend?
-I think he's with Sang-yeon.

00:10:54.153 --> 00:10:55.279
Just the two of them?

00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:57.657
Yeah, he needs to give her something.

00:10:58.282 --> 00:11:01.619
Ryu Eun-jung, you're brimming
with confidence, aren't you?

00:11:02.495 --> 00:11:03.704
What are you getting at?

00:11:03.788 --> 00:11:07.500
Yeah, okay. You're not the jealous type.

00:11:08.042 --> 00:11:09.835
Of course I am.

00:11:10.586 --> 00:11:14.965
But if I stress over them having tea,
our relationship's as good as doomed.

00:11:15.049 --> 00:11:17.426
I warn you not to be overly trusting.

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:20.846
You never know what might ignite a spark
between a man and a woman.

00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:23.182
How did you know that I was Uncle Tat?

00:11:25.643 --> 00:11:26.477
Sorry?

00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:29.271
The fact that I was Uncle Tat.

00:11:30.272 --> 00:11:31.440
You already knew, didn't you?

00:11:33.984 --> 00:11:38.489
Isn't that why you didn't ask me yesterday
how I knew about the message from Moonee?

00:11:42.576 --> 00:11:44.203
-You're right.
-How did you know?

00:11:45.162 --> 00:11:49.166
I don't recall ever writing my real name
in my messages to him.

00:11:50.918 --> 00:11:55.256
Maybe not in your messages,
but you must have written it somewhere.

00:12:00.803 --> 00:12:07.393
I happened to log in
to my brother's messenger account,

00:12:08.561 --> 00:12:13.441
and I saw that a user named Uncle Tat
was the only one truly concerned for him.

00:12:13.524 --> 00:12:15.943
A whole year after his passing, at that.

00:12:17.403 --> 00:12:20.614
So, out of curiosity,

00:12:21.115 --> 00:12:25.244
I looked up all of your posts.

00:12:25.953 --> 00:12:29.498
I must have seen your name,
Kim Sang-hak, then.

00:12:31.625 --> 00:12:34.336
So you knew me from the start?

00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:39.258
Even before you joined the club?

00:12:40.593 --> 00:12:41.427
Yes.

00:12:43.888 --> 00:12:47.433
Why didn't you say something
if you knew who I was?

00:12:53.355 --> 00:12:54.648
If I had…

00:12:57.777 --> 00:12:59.236
would anything be different?

00:13:01.113 --> 00:13:01.947
What?

00:13:06.368 --> 00:13:10.873
Of course things would be different.
You're Moonee's sister.

00:13:12.041 --> 00:13:15.920
If I had known from the start,
I would have looked out for you more.

00:13:16.587 --> 00:13:18.130
I don't need any of that.

00:13:26.222 --> 00:13:28.349
I don't need you to look out for me.

00:13:34.939 --> 00:13:38.400
Why not? It's always nice to know
that someone's got your back.

00:13:40.319 --> 00:13:42.905
Thanks for these tapes.
Will you be staying?

00:13:44.323 --> 00:13:47.076
Yeah. When Eun-jung gets here,
we're meeting the others--

00:13:47.159 --> 00:13:48.369
I'll see you, then.

00:13:51.539 --> 00:13:52.373
My bad.

00:13:54.208 --> 00:13:55.709
It's fine. I'll pay for…

00:14:10.766 --> 00:14:12.476
Sang-yeon's going on a blind date?

00:14:13.227 --> 00:14:15.062
Yeah. Why do you look so shocked?

00:14:15.855 --> 00:14:20.234
Of course it's shocking.
She's been indifferent to all guys.

00:14:20.317 --> 00:14:23.070
When did she say she'd go on a blind date?

00:14:23.153 --> 00:14:25.030
I ran into her earlier on campus.

00:14:25.114 --> 00:14:27.491
I told her A-ra turned it down,
and she asked to go instead.

00:14:28.576 --> 00:14:29.577
How strange.

00:14:31.996 --> 00:14:32.955
What's up with her?

00:14:34.999 --> 00:14:36.750
I'll also have a Big Mac.

00:14:36.834 --> 00:14:39.628
-Two Big Mac combos, please.
-Sure.

00:14:39.712 --> 00:14:41.171
Wait, this one's on me.

00:14:53.267 --> 00:14:55.269
Since it's what you craved the most.

00:14:57.354 --> 00:14:59.148
And extra ketchup, please.

00:14:59.231 --> 00:15:00.065
Sure.

00:15:02.318 --> 00:15:05.404
Do you think it's okay
if I don't text Sang-yeon?

00:15:05.905 --> 00:15:06.739
About what?

00:15:07.907 --> 00:15:09.325
That I'm not coming home.

00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:15.873
What kind of person is Sang-yeon?

00:15:16.749 --> 00:15:18.250
What kind of question is that?

00:15:18.751 --> 00:15:22.755
You've known her for almost a year now.
What do you think?

00:15:23.756 --> 00:15:24.840
I'm not sure.

00:15:25.716 --> 00:15:30.512
She seems harder to read
than I first thought. More complex.

00:15:32.890 --> 00:15:35.267
She is indeed hard to read and complex.

00:15:36.518 --> 00:15:39.396
She has a tendency
to say and do the opposite.

00:15:40.105 --> 00:15:41.065
The opposite?

00:15:42.775 --> 00:15:46.320
I told you she puts on a front
when she's really struggling.

00:15:47.279 --> 00:15:49.114
Maybe she's too proud.

00:15:50.741 --> 00:15:53.410
-Complete opposite of me, isn't she?
-Totally.

00:16:12.846 --> 00:16:14.056
An early start?

00:16:14.765 --> 00:16:16.016
I have an early class.

00:16:16.934 --> 00:16:18.185
So do I.

00:16:18.686 --> 00:16:19.687
You're running late.

00:16:28.195 --> 00:16:29.279
Hello.

00:16:29.863 --> 00:16:33.200
Oh, hey. You must have a morning class.

00:16:33.283 --> 00:16:34.410
Yes, first period.

00:16:37.454 --> 00:16:38.330
Seonbae.

00:16:39.498 --> 00:16:43.794
Did you tell Eun-jung
that I asked you for that girl's number?

00:16:43.877 --> 00:16:45.754
No, I didn't. Why?

00:16:46.922 --> 00:16:49.466
If you haven't,
could you please keep it a secret?

00:16:51.093 --> 00:16:51.927
Why?

00:16:53.762 --> 00:16:56.098
Just because it's my business.

00:16:57.307 --> 00:17:01.020
I'd rather not discuss it with anyone
until I know what happened to my brother.

00:17:03.564 --> 00:17:07.067
But, Sang-yeon… Eun-jung is curious
about your brother too.

00:17:07.151 --> 00:17:10.446
I'll tell her eventually, once I find out.

00:17:13.198 --> 00:17:14.033
You will?

00:17:15.242 --> 00:17:16.410
I won't tell her, then.

00:17:18.662 --> 00:17:19.496
Could you

00:17:20.914 --> 00:17:24.209
also keep it a secret
that I sent messages to Uncle Tat?

00:17:26.086 --> 00:17:27.004
How come?

00:17:29.089 --> 00:17:30.924
You're still here?

00:17:31.008 --> 00:17:34.344
Let's go. Yay, you're late too.

00:17:39.892 --> 00:17:41.185
This is pretty good.

00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:46.440
"Pretty good"? It's an A+!

00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:48.609
What grade did you get last year?

00:17:49.109 --> 00:17:50.652
An A… minus.

00:17:53.822 --> 00:17:57.076
But it's really well-written.
So that's how you get an A+.

00:17:57.159 --> 00:17:58.202
Really?

00:17:58.952 --> 00:18:00.204
This is well-written?

00:18:00.287 --> 00:18:02.539
All I did was talk crap about that film.

00:18:02.623 --> 00:18:05.834
No, you were being honest
while providing a balanced argument.

00:18:05.918 --> 00:18:07.503
I see why this is debate-worthy.

00:18:09.129 --> 00:18:10.547
-Really?
-Yeah.

00:18:11.048 --> 00:18:13.842
You know what? I really love movies.

00:18:15.594 --> 00:18:20.224
I never knew that so much
could be captured in a single shot.

00:18:20.808 --> 00:18:22.518
But it doesn't stop there.

00:18:22.601 --> 00:18:25.354
In our last lecture,
we saw Fellini's I Vitelloni.

00:18:25.437 --> 00:18:29.733
In the last scene, there's a tracking shot
of the friends asleep--

00:18:29.817 --> 00:18:30.901
Hey, Ryu Eun-jung.

00:18:32.111 --> 00:18:33.987
Yeah? What is it?

00:18:34.571 --> 00:18:36.448
Pick one. Is it me or movies?

00:18:39.159 --> 00:18:40.077
What?

00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:42.204
Here you go.

00:18:42.871 --> 00:18:45.207
What's this? Is this for me?

00:18:47.626 --> 00:18:50.129
No way. It's a director's viewfinder!

00:18:50.212 --> 00:18:51.505
Yeah, a mini one.

00:18:55.342 --> 00:18:56.260
Do you like it?

00:18:56.343 --> 00:18:59.721
I love it! How did you come up with
the idea to get me this?

00:18:59.805 --> 00:19:02.266
You like taking pictures.

00:19:02.349 --> 00:19:07.062
Since cameras aren't allowed on base,
I thought you could use this instead.

00:19:07.146 --> 00:19:09.273
I'm so touched.

00:19:14.570 --> 00:19:15.404
What is it?

00:19:16.905 --> 00:19:18.907
I can't take this onto base.

00:19:18.991 --> 00:19:21.076
Seriously? Why not?

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:24.121
We're only allowed watches.

00:19:27.207 --> 00:19:28.167
Really?

00:19:31.211 --> 00:19:32.462
Are you that bummed?

00:19:33.213 --> 00:19:35.382
The military is so strict.

00:19:35.465 --> 00:19:37.926
I was so excited to give you this.

00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:39.178
Should I sneak it in?

00:19:42.514 --> 00:19:43.891
What if you get caught?

00:19:44.474 --> 00:19:45.767
I'd be in big trouble.

00:19:49.563 --> 00:19:53.901
I'll make it up to you
by treasuring this for a long time. Deal?

00:19:55.027 --> 00:19:56.236
Fine. Deal.

00:19:57.654 --> 00:19:59.698
Are your dad's ancestral rites tonight?

00:19:59.781 --> 00:20:01.200
Yeah, at midnight.

00:20:02.409 --> 00:20:05.579
If you see Uncle Ddinguri later,
remind him about the loader.

00:20:05.662 --> 00:20:06.496
Okay.

00:20:09.541 --> 00:20:10.709
-I'm off.
-Bye.

00:20:45.702 --> 00:20:47.704
Sang-yeon said it was as if by magic.

00:20:49.706 --> 00:20:51.041
It was as if by magic…

00:20:53.210 --> 00:20:55.212
Sang-hak seonbae happened to be there.

00:21:39.339 --> 00:21:40.215
Sang-yeon.

00:22:03.238 --> 00:22:04.448
What are you doing here?

00:22:05.407 --> 00:22:06.867
I was going to look for some books.

00:22:07.617 --> 00:22:09.411
-I see.
-What about you?

00:22:09.494 --> 00:22:12.873
I was in Ilyeong to see Eun-jung.
Now I'm meeting someone here.

00:22:12.956 --> 00:22:15.667
That's right.
They're doing their ancestral rites today.

00:22:15.751 --> 00:22:16.710
Yeah.

00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:21.298
You're headed back to base tomorrow,
aren't you?

00:22:24.968 --> 00:22:26.636
Take care on your way back.

00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:29.264
Yeah, have fun browsing for books.

00:22:29.848 --> 00:22:30.682
Okay.

00:22:32.601 --> 00:22:33.769
Sang-yeon, wait.

00:22:34.936 --> 00:22:38.315
I'm actually meeting the guy
who may have Dylan's contact details.

00:22:39.066 --> 00:22:40.817
Do you want to come with me?

00:22:42.694 --> 00:22:43.695
Right now?

00:22:48.617 --> 00:22:52.829
That, she said,
was how it had all started.

00:22:54.539 --> 00:22:56.208
That unforgettable night.

00:22:57.959 --> 00:22:59.711
JANG'S GAMJATANG

00:22:59.795 --> 00:23:02.798
I'm sorry I couldn't find
Dylan's contact information.

00:23:02.881 --> 00:23:06.760
Oh, don't be. I appreciate that
you took the time to look into it.

00:23:07.386 --> 00:23:11.890
That doesn't mean I'm done looking.
I'll keep asking around.

00:23:13.225 --> 00:23:14.893
Why are you looking for Dylan?

00:23:17.104 --> 00:23:21.566
There's just something
I'd like to know about my brother.

00:23:24.694 --> 00:23:27.197
What was he like? My brother.

00:23:28.824 --> 00:23:29.658
Moonee?

00:23:33.328 --> 00:23:34.413
Moonee was…

00:23:39.584 --> 00:23:40.710
He was so meticulous.

00:23:40.794 --> 00:23:41.962
I'm already laughing.

00:23:42.045 --> 00:23:45.382
We'd be halfway through our meals,
and he'd still be mixing his food.

00:23:45.465 --> 00:23:47.175
Man, he's so frustrating!

00:23:47.259 --> 00:23:49.636
He was fine though.
We were the frustrated ones.

00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:52.764
And he looks frail at first glance--

00:23:52.848 --> 00:23:54.641
But, nope, that is one thing he's not.

00:23:54.724 --> 00:23:57.060
Do you remember
his "you have no right" speech?

00:23:57.144 --> 00:24:00.772
Heck yeah, I do. We were in Incheon,
and Moonee was so pissed.

00:24:00.856 --> 00:24:04.693
-He marches right up to him--
-And says, "What are you doing, sir?"

00:24:04.776 --> 00:24:06.403
-That sounds like him.
-"Sir, stop."

00:24:06.486 --> 00:24:09.322
-Careful on your way home. Call me.
-Yeah, call me.

00:24:09.823 --> 00:24:10.657
Call me.

00:24:11.992 --> 00:24:16.455
I should have some of his photos at home.
Would you like them?

00:24:16.997 --> 00:24:18.206
Yes, please.

00:24:19.458 --> 00:24:22.377
I'll take anything of my brother's.

00:24:24.129 --> 00:24:24.963
Is that so?

00:24:25.672 --> 00:24:27.007
What's so funny?

00:24:27.632 --> 00:24:31.344
Nothing. I just think Moonee
would have found you adorable just now.

00:24:34.431 --> 00:24:35.724
My brother?

00:24:37.434 --> 00:24:39.728
Did he ever mention me to you?

00:24:39.811 --> 00:24:40.812
Mention you?

00:24:40.896 --> 00:24:41.730
Yeah.

00:24:44.733 --> 00:24:46.193
Forget I even asked.

00:24:50.697 --> 00:24:53.909
You need to take the 134, right?

00:24:53.992 --> 00:24:54.868
Yes.

00:24:55.952 --> 00:24:58.872
Aren't you taking the subway?
We already passed the station.

00:24:58.955 --> 00:25:00.457
I'll see you off.

00:25:01.666 --> 00:25:05.212
I'm feeling a bit stuffy,
so I think I'll walk for a bit.

00:25:07.130 --> 00:25:10.175
How about we walk to Jonggak station?
It would help us sober up.

00:25:11.676 --> 00:25:12.594
I'd love to.

00:25:15.764 --> 00:25:18.225
When he was younger,
he was a real chatterbox.

00:25:18.308 --> 00:25:20.310
He used to play dollhouse with me

00:25:20.393 --> 00:25:24.314
and was even nice enough
to let me hang out with his friends.

00:25:24.898 --> 00:25:27.484
Then puberty hit,
and his personality changed.

00:25:28.235 --> 00:25:32.322
I never understood it.
He became a different person overnight.

00:25:33.573 --> 00:25:38.537
I think I have been upset with him
ever since.

00:25:39.037 --> 00:25:43.583
Whenever we would get a chance to talk,
I was snappy for no particular reason.

00:25:44.543 --> 00:25:45.919
Just like in his photo.

00:25:47.337 --> 00:25:51.508
That's right. The "do not enter" sign.

00:25:55.428 --> 00:25:56.263
Hang on.

00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:00.016
He did mention you.

00:26:01.184 --> 00:26:02.686
Aren't you good at dancing?

00:26:04.604 --> 00:26:08.400
That's right. He did mention you.
He said you were a good dancer.

00:26:09.818 --> 00:26:11.820
But he wouldn't even know.

00:26:13.572 --> 00:26:16.491
My brother's never seen me dance before.

00:26:16.575 --> 00:26:18.243
-He hasn't?
-Nope.

00:26:18.326 --> 00:26:22.664
He bragged about how good you were,
and then he smiled, looking all pleased.

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:26.585
-He did?
-Yeah.

00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:30.171
Now that I think about it,

00:26:31.131 --> 00:26:34.092
that photo he took
of the "do not enter" sign…

00:26:36.094 --> 00:26:38.930
maybe he actually wanted to enter.

00:26:40.348 --> 00:26:42.183
Why else would he have taken that?

00:26:44.769 --> 00:26:48.189
Every photo he took of you
showed his brotherly affection.

00:26:51.693 --> 00:26:52.819
You think?

00:27:25.226 --> 00:27:28.188
I can't believe I still remember all this.

00:27:28.271 --> 00:27:30.065
What were you saying just now?

00:27:30.148 --> 00:27:31.816
Watch the movie, and you'll get it.

00:27:32.317 --> 00:27:36.446
Stephen Chow says these lines twice,
and the second time really hits home.

00:27:38.031 --> 00:27:39.658
So are they sad lines?

00:27:41.910 --> 00:27:43.453
You could say that.

00:27:44.371 --> 00:27:49.042
It's still surprising that my brother
liked Stephen Chow movies.

00:27:49.542 --> 00:27:53.421
I think he most liked A Chinese Odyssey.
Especially Part Two: Cinderella.

00:27:57.008 --> 00:27:58.051
We're here.

00:28:04.140 --> 00:28:08.853
Should we walk to the next station
so we can finish this conversation?

00:28:11.731 --> 00:28:12.565
Shall we?

00:28:17.070 --> 00:28:20.156
Part two is, in a way,
a prequel to the first movie.

00:28:21.491 --> 00:28:25.036
The troubled Sun Wukong
finally realizes his destiny, and…

00:28:47.726 --> 00:28:50.562
CHUNGJEONGNO STATION

00:28:52.564 --> 00:28:53.481
We're here.

00:28:58.945 --> 00:28:59.988
So we are.

00:29:01.698 --> 00:29:05.368
I was so into our conversation
that I didn't even realize it.

00:29:07.454 --> 00:29:08.830
Are your legs okay?

00:29:09.664 --> 00:29:11.916
Hey, don't underestimate the ROK army.

00:29:18.423 --> 00:29:22.469
Shouldn't you go now
if you want to catch the last train?

00:29:22.969 --> 00:29:26.848
I'll walk you home since we're so close.
That'll at least give me bragging rights.

00:29:28.266 --> 00:29:29.184
If you say so.

00:29:32.771 --> 00:29:36.191
I want to know what you think
if you watch the films. Let me know.

00:29:36.274 --> 00:29:37.108
I will.

00:29:40.195 --> 00:29:41.362
By the way,

00:29:42.614 --> 00:29:44.282
about those VHS tapes…

00:29:47.660 --> 00:29:49.746
my brother didn't lend them to you.

00:29:52.874 --> 00:29:53.750
What do you mean?

00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:58.671
He gave them to you to keep.

00:30:01.007 --> 00:30:05.136
The day he gave you those
was the day you last saw him, right?

00:30:07.514 --> 00:30:09.224
He gave them to you for a reason.

00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:13.520
He wanted you to have them.

00:30:14.646 --> 00:30:15.480
Really?

00:30:16.439 --> 00:30:17.273
Yes.

00:30:19.984 --> 00:30:22.904
Did you know
that he gave Eun-jung his camera?

00:30:23.404 --> 00:30:24.447
His camera?

00:30:25.281 --> 00:30:26.991
It's the Leica I'm using now.

00:30:29.118 --> 00:30:30.578
That roll of film

00:30:31.079 --> 00:30:35.875
was loaded in the camera he gave her
before he left.

00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:47.428
That was his will.

00:30:53.726 --> 00:30:55.645
I knew it the moment I saw the photos.

00:30:59.148 --> 00:31:02.360
"This is Cheon Sang-hak's will."

00:31:08.658 --> 00:31:11.327
Isn't it exactly the sort of will
he'd leave behind?

00:31:15.874 --> 00:31:18.042
I didn't even get a goodbye,

00:31:18.835 --> 00:31:21.963
but he left Eun-jung his camera.

00:31:23.047 --> 00:31:24.841
That's why I asked you not to tell her.

00:31:27.343 --> 00:31:29.345
To keep it a secret from Eun-jung.

00:31:31.055 --> 00:31:32.724
I wanted to find out first.

00:31:36.269 --> 00:31:37.812
I wanted to be the one

00:31:39.397 --> 00:31:40.732
who was the first to know.

00:31:50.450 --> 00:31:52.535
Those tapes are yours,

00:31:53.786 --> 00:31:57.123
so let's just say
I borrowed them from Uncle Tat for now.

00:32:01.878 --> 00:32:03.129
Thank you for today.

00:32:03.671 --> 00:32:06.257
No problem. I had fun too.

00:32:07.926 --> 00:32:08.760
Good night.

00:32:10.303 --> 00:32:11.262
Take care.

00:32:11.763 --> 00:32:12.597
Okay.

00:32:14.474 --> 00:32:15.308
Good night.

00:32:27.236 --> 00:32:29.238
I liked Uncle Tat, you know.

00:32:49.634 --> 00:32:50.969
You can't.

00:32:57.517 --> 00:32:58.810
What do you mean I can't?

00:33:00.353 --> 00:33:01.938
I said nothing about liking you.

00:33:03.189 --> 00:33:05.650
I liked Uncle Tat, not Kim Sang-hak.

00:33:08.820 --> 00:33:09.779
Right.

00:33:15.118 --> 00:33:16.202
I'm grateful.

00:33:17.078 --> 00:33:20.331
I never imagined that anyone
could care for a reckless fool like him.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:23.376
I'm the one who's grateful.

00:33:26.087 --> 00:33:28.172
If it weren't for Uncle Tat,

00:33:29.465 --> 00:33:32.844
I would still be cooped up
in that tiny room in Gangneung.

00:33:38.975 --> 00:33:42.729
It made me happy to know that
my brother lived on in Uncle Tat's mind.

00:33:46.941 --> 00:33:49.610
To think that
my brother was undeniably alive…

00:33:52.196 --> 00:33:54.365
That brought me a lot of joy back then.

00:34:32.862 --> 00:34:36.783
-The three of you, including Sang-yeon?
-We ran into each other near Gwanghwamun.

00:34:38.284 --> 00:34:40.703
I feel so left out.
Sounds like you had fun.

00:34:41.662 --> 00:34:42.872
What did you talk about?

00:34:44.916 --> 00:34:48.669
Nothing much. Mainly about the past
and the Moonee we knew.

00:34:48.753 --> 00:34:49.962
Did you drink a lot?

00:34:50.046 --> 00:34:53.007
Yeah, a lot. Talking about the past
kept the drinks flowing.

00:34:54.175 --> 00:34:55.885
I hope she's doing okay.

00:34:55.968 --> 00:34:57.095
Why?

00:34:57.178 --> 00:34:59.222
Hope she's not hungover
for her blind date today.

00:35:00.431 --> 00:35:02.683
Oh, was that today?

00:35:02.767 --> 00:35:04.936
Maybe she'll finally get over
her first love.

00:35:05.686 --> 00:35:06.521
First love?

00:35:07.814 --> 00:35:11.484
I told you, didn't I?
The guy she met online back in Gangneung.

00:35:12.819 --> 00:35:14.987
Right, you did.

00:35:17.949 --> 00:35:19.867
I hope her blind date goes well.

00:35:24.872 --> 00:35:29.043
If it weren't for the group project,
I would have seen you off at the station.

00:35:29.127 --> 00:35:33.673
It's fine. I prefer saying goodbye here.
Goodbyes at the station feel too final.

00:35:37.093 --> 00:35:39.679
-I'll write to you.
-You better write me a bunch.

00:35:43.933 --> 00:35:45.726
-Take care.
-Okay.

00:35:47.478 --> 00:35:49.230
-I'll come visit you.
-Okay.

00:35:49.730 --> 00:35:50.565
Go now.

00:36:01.325 --> 00:36:02.160
Bye.

00:36:29.145 --> 00:36:32.064
Whoa, Kim Sang-hak.
Since when were you smart?

00:36:32.148 --> 00:36:33.441
I've always been smart.

00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:35.651
Let's take a photo.

00:36:53.002 --> 00:36:56.172
Just because you hit on everyone
doesn't mean we all do.

00:36:56.255 --> 00:36:58.591
-Have you lost your damn mind?
-Come on, guys!

00:36:58.674 --> 00:37:00.676
-Stop it!
-Get over here!

00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:01.928
We're so sorry.

00:37:02.011 --> 00:37:03.512
-Are you okay?
-Cool it.

00:37:04.013 --> 00:37:04.847
Are you okay?

00:37:05.348 --> 00:37:06.974
The moment he realized…

00:37:08.976 --> 00:37:11.646
that, all along,
Sang-yeon had been there in his past…

00:37:14.523 --> 00:37:16.234
I wonder if he still believed her.

00:37:19.028 --> 00:37:24.242
Her words that it was Uncle Tat
whom she had liked

00:37:25.910 --> 00:37:27.370
and not Kim Sang-hak.

00:37:41.676 --> 00:37:44.178
SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING, FRESHMAN

00:38:08.244 --> 00:38:11.747
SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING, FRESHMAN
TO CHEON SANG-YEON

00:38:19.171 --> 00:38:20.006
UNCLE TAT

00:38:25.094 --> 00:38:27.054
I'm glad I'm able to give you this.

00:38:47.992 --> 00:38:49.910
Second division, prone firing position!

00:38:49.994 --> 00:38:51.412
Prone firing position!

00:38:56.709 --> 00:38:58.044
It's getting cold, isn't it?

00:38:59.086 --> 00:39:03.341
It's only November,
but it's gotten pretty chilly here too.

00:39:03.424 --> 00:39:07.345
Temperatures in Cheorwon, Hwacheon,
and the central mountains of Gangwon

00:39:07.428 --> 00:39:09.930
remain below freezing, even now.

00:39:10.014 --> 00:39:13.142
In and around Seoul,
daytime highs hover around six…

00:39:13.225 --> 00:39:17.021
Now my ears prick up
at the mere mention of "Cheorwon."

00:39:17.521 --> 00:39:19.648
-Kim Sang-hak.
-Private Kim Sang-hak!

00:39:21.650 --> 00:39:22.818
Thank you, sir!

00:39:23.861 --> 00:39:24.904
RYU EUN-JUNG

00:39:24.987 --> 00:39:27.114
Everyone knows about
your orange envelopes now.

00:39:27.907 --> 00:39:30.701
When the post arrives,
they hand it to me first thing.

00:39:31.911 --> 00:39:35.873
I'm at the library because I'm determined
to get a scholarship this semester,

00:39:36.457 --> 00:39:39.335
but all I've done this morning
is write this letter.

00:39:41.462 --> 00:39:44.465
Yesterday,
I finally met Sang-yeon's blind date.

00:39:44.548 --> 00:39:47.051
He is a senior
majoring in computer science at KAIST.

00:39:47.134 --> 00:39:48.636
-My date.
-He's pretty cute.

00:39:48.719 --> 00:39:49.762
-Hello.
-Hello.

00:39:49.845 --> 00:39:53.808
I thought that if all goes well,
we could go on a double date with them,

00:39:54.475 --> 00:39:57.478
but I don't think
Sang-yeon's that into him.

00:39:58.813 --> 00:40:01.190
Even so, she still goes on dates with him,

00:40:01.816 --> 00:40:05.486
but at times, it seems like
she's just going through the motions.

00:40:06.237 --> 00:40:09.573
The other day, they went to see a matinee,

00:40:09.657 --> 00:40:11.409
but she was back by 4:00 p.m.

00:40:12.952 --> 00:40:14.120
What is that?

00:40:14.203 --> 00:40:15.538
A VHS player.

00:40:18.207 --> 00:40:20.459
Where on earth did you find a VHS player?

00:40:20.543 --> 00:40:23.212
What do you mean, where?
I bought it, of course.

00:40:33.764 --> 00:40:36.267
If the heavens were to grant me
another chance,

00:40:36.892 --> 00:40:39.103
I would tell her that Iove her.

00:40:40.312 --> 00:40:46.610
If my love for her must expire,
let it do so after ten thousand years.

00:40:53.284 --> 00:40:54.201
Are you crying?

00:40:55.703 --> 00:40:56.912
No.

00:41:02.585 --> 00:41:03.919
What are you watching?

00:41:04.795 --> 00:41:05.963
Stephen Chow.

00:41:07.423 --> 00:41:08.466
A Chinese Odyssey.

00:41:16.474 --> 00:41:17.725
Is it good?

00:41:19.101 --> 00:41:19.935
Yeah.

00:41:21.312 --> 00:41:24.773
It was the movie
from Sang-hak oppa's photo.

00:41:28.194 --> 00:41:30.237
-Kim Sang-hak.
-Private Kim Sang-hak!

00:41:30.738 --> 00:41:31.655
Thank you, sir!

00:41:32.615 --> 00:41:33.824
Hey, this one's yours.

00:41:33.908 --> 00:41:35.743
Private Kim Beom-jun. Thank you, sir!

00:41:37.578 --> 00:41:39.497
Wait. Kim Sang-hak?

00:41:39.580 --> 00:41:40.956
Private Kim Sang-hak!

00:41:42.666 --> 00:41:43.501
Thank you, sir!

00:41:44.001 --> 00:41:45.377
CHEON SANG-YEON

00:41:45.461 --> 00:41:46.295
It's from a girl.

00:41:46.879 --> 00:41:48.756
This is unfair.

00:41:48.839 --> 00:41:49.882
Are you two-timing?

00:41:50.382 --> 00:41:52.968
I would never, sir!
She's a girl from my university club!

00:41:53.052 --> 00:41:54.428
-From university?
-Yes, sir!

00:41:54.512 --> 00:41:55.387
Is she pretty?

00:41:56.263 --> 00:41:59.391
Not one bit, sir!
She has a boyfriend, sir!

00:41:59.475 --> 00:42:02.353
-Darn it.
-Forget it. Just sit down, man.

00:42:03.938 --> 00:42:05.356
Dear Sang-hak seonbae,

00:42:06.273 --> 00:42:08.025
I hope you are doing well.

00:42:08.943 --> 00:42:12.321
I finally watched
A Chinese Odyssey yesterday.

00:42:15.282 --> 00:42:17.660
It was right on top of the shoe cabinet.

00:42:18.911 --> 00:42:21.622
I passed the gates just now,
so come down in ten.

00:42:22.289 --> 00:42:23.123
Okay.

00:43:05.583 --> 00:43:06.875
Thanks, Eun-jung.

00:43:06.959 --> 00:43:08.877
I promise to return this favor…

00:43:17.386 --> 00:43:18.596
You have a letter

00:43:19.555 --> 00:43:20.889
from Sang-hak seonbae.

00:43:23.392 --> 00:43:25.394
Oh, you're right.

00:43:25.894 --> 00:43:28.230
SENDER
PRIVATE KIM SANG-HAK

00:43:32.943 --> 00:43:33.902
Here.

00:43:35.779 --> 00:43:37.031
Right, thanks.

00:43:44.371 --> 00:43:47.207
He wrote to me
because I asked him for a favor.

00:43:48.834 --> 00:43:49.835
Right.

00:43:51.545 --> 00:43:52.379
See you.

00:44:54.191 --> 00:44:55.442
Are you done?

00:44:57.277 --> 00:44:59.279
Hey, about the…

00:45:02.157 --> 00:45:05.119
The letter really was
because I asked him for something.

00:45:07.830 --> 00:45:09.248
You told me that yesterday.

00:45:10.499 --> 00:45:12.876
I just didn't want you to misunderstand.

00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:14.378
In what way?

00:45:20.300 --> 00:45:22.469
There is no misunderstanding here.

00:45:46.285 --> 00:45:49.037
This is Dylan's number.
Her real name is Moon Ji-yeong.

00:45:52.082 --> 00:45:55.961
"M."

00:45:57.421 --> 00:46:00.215
Every entry is written to her.

00:46:03.719 --> 00:46:07.389
But she says
she wants to talk to Sang-hak first.

00:46:09.975 --> 00:46:11.310
With him?

00:46:11.852 --> 00:46:12.686
Yes.

00:46:33.332 --> 00:46:36.001
What's wrong? Is something up?

00:46:39.171 --> 00:46:42.424
Weren't you working on photos today
so you can help your mom tomorrow?

00:46:45.719 --> 00:46:46.970
I'll get to it.

00:46:54.394 --> 00:46:56.063
What's got you in a huff?

00:46:57.856 --> 00:47:00.359
God, I'm so pissed!

00:47:02.694 --> 00:47:06.031
You broke up because of promise rings?
What's wrong with them?

00:47:06.114 --> 00:47:08.617
Another girl helped him pick them out!

00:47:09.284 --> 00:47:10.285
Another girl?

00:47:10.869 --> 00:47:14.414
There's this chick named Seung-hui,
his friend from middle school.

00:47:14.498 --> 00:47:17.292
They both insist they're friends
and 100% platonic,

00:47:17.376 --> 00:47:19.503
but I was getting a weird vibe.

00:47:19.586 --> 00:47:21.839
So I said, "Let's all meet for drinks."

00:47:23.048 --> 00:47:26.802
And guess what?
He served her fishcake soup first!

00:47:31.765 --> 00:47:34.643
-Fishcake--
-Look, just hear me out.

00:47:35.310 --> 00:47:37.688
I was so pissed that I had a go at him.

00:47:38.188 --> 00:47:41.441
That's when he went on about
their platonic relationship,

00:47:41.525 --> 00:47:43.735
saying I shouldn't misunderstand.

00:47:43.819 --> 00:47:47.906
Their relationship is so platonic
that she chose our promise rings.

00:47:47.990 --> 00:47:49.741
Is he out of his damn mind?

00:47:49.825 --> 00:47:52.369
Why would he pick out our rings with her?

00:47:52.870 --> 00:47:56.874
They've been using the rings as an excuse
to meet and get in touch!

00:48:03.755 --> 00:48:05.048
That's…

00:48:07.301 --> 00:48:08.927
wrong, isn't it?

00:48:10.095 --> 00:48:11.013
What is?

00:48:12.723 --> 00:48:13.765
Those two.

00:48:14.600 --> 00:48:16.435
What they're doing to you.

00:48:17.686 --> 00:48:20.355
Of course it's wrong!

00:48:24.234 --> 00:48:26.904
I envy you
for having such clear standards.

00:48:26.987 --> 00:48:29.031
Who cares about standards?

00:48:29.114 --> 00:48:32.910
It takes two to be in a relationship.
And if I'm upset, he's crossed a line.

00:48:33.577 --> 00:48:35.913
I think I'd rather be cheated on.

00:48:36.413 --> 00:48:40.167
They're making a fool out of me
with whatever they've got going on.

00:48:41.752 --> 00:48:45.339
God, this is so depressing.

00:49:00.687 --> 00:49:01.605
Answer your phone.

00:49:04.107 --> 00:49:04.942
What?

00:49:13.533 --> 00:49:15.619
This is a collect call.

00:49:16.119 --> 00:49:17.079
It's me!

00:49:20.874 --> 00:49:21.917
Hello?

00:49:22.501 --> 00:49:24.670
I'm a private first class now.
Aren't you happy?

00:49:26.713 --> 00:49:29.257
Yeah, I'm happy. Why wouldn't I be?

00:49:31.051 --> 00:49:31.927
Are you angry?

00:49:32.719 --> 00:49:33.637
Why would I be?

00:49:34.262 --> 00:49:37.099
You didn't write or come to visit me…

00:49:37.182 --> 00:49:39.142
I didn't want to write, so I didn't.

00:49:40.143 --> 00:49:41.520
Why didn't you want to?

00:49:45.065 --> 00:49:48.151
Why did you send
Sang-yeon's letter to campus?

00:49:50.737 --> 00:49:52.614
-What?
-Your letter to Sang-yeon.

00:49:52.698 --> 00:49:54.533
Why did you send it to her department?

00:49:54.616 --> 00:50:00.038
She says that you wrote to her
because she asked you for a favor.

00:50:01.123 --> 00:50:02.666
What exactly was this favor?

00:50:04.251 --> 00:50:05.377
Well, you see--

00:50:05.460 --> 00:50:08.255
Forget it.
Don't tell me if you don't want to.

00:50:08.338 --> 00:50:10.007
It's not like that, just…

00:50:12.801 --> 00:50:14.052
Look, Eun-jung.

00:50:15.470 --> 00:50:17.973
I'm sorry I didn't tell you about it,

00:50:18.807 --> 00:50:23.103
but I really can't discuss it right now.
I promise to tell you soon--

00:50:23.186 --> 00:50:28.025
I have no clue what you're getting at.
My question is why you sent it to campus.

00:50:28.108 --> 00:50:32.362
Why not our house or the clubroom?
You're just making me question things.

00:50:36.783 --> 00:50:37.617
I'm sorry.

00:50:38.201 --> 00:50:43.081
Send your letters to our house.
I won't look even if you ask me to.

00:50:45.709 --> 00:50:46.918
Hello? Eun-jung?

00:51:20.535 --> 00:51:21.620
Hey.

00:51:22.370 --> 00:51:23.205
Hey.

00:51:25.248 --> 00:51:26.374
Tough day, I bet.

00:51:27.292 --> 00:51:28.627
I'm used to it by now.

00:51:32.506 --> 00:51:36.176
Here. Some garae-tteok.
Mom knows you like them, so…

00:51:36.259 --> 00:51:39.179
They look so good.
I've actually been craving them.

00:51:39.262 --> 00:51:40.931
They're freshly made today.

00:51:48.814 --> 00:51:49.856
Also…

00:51:54.319 --> 00:51:56.655
Mom wishes you a happy new year.

00:52:00.700 --> 00:52:02.828
I should go visit her soon.

00:52:06.414 --> 00:52:08.875
I'll put this in the freezer.

00:52:08.959 --> 00:52:09.793
Okay.

00:52:13.046 --> 00:52:14.381
I never brought the letter up

00:52:16.216 --> 00:52:17.592
with Sang-yeon.

00:52:18.593 --> 00:52:19.761
They're good.

00:52:19.845 --> 00:52:21.346
As if to pretend that…

00:52:22.347 --> 00:52:23.890
Have you picked your photos?

00:52:23.974 --> 00:52:26.476
…something so trivial
couldn't faze him and me.

00:52:32.983 --> 00:52:35.235
-It's been a while.
-Eun-jung, you're here.

00:52:35.735 --> 00:52:36.736
Happy new year.

00:52:36.820 --> 00:52:38.280
Happy new year to you too.

00:52:38.363 --> 00:52:39.531
And this.

00:52:41.074 --> 00:52:42.534
Sorry it took so long.

00:52:42.617 --> 00:52:45.412
It's no biggie. This wasn't urgent anyway.

00:52:45.495 --> 00:52:49.207
I'm still sorry.
Could I also have some photo paper?

00:52:49.291 --> 00:52:51.710
Ilford 11 by 14, glossy, please.

00:52:51.793 --> 00:52:55.297
Ilford 11 by 14, glossy.
You must be preparing for an exhibition.

00:52:55.380 --> 00:53:00.302
Yes, it opens on February 13th. Will you
not come since Sang-hak won't be there?

00:53:00.385 --> 00:53:01.678
I will if I can make time.

00:53:02.179 --> 00:53:04.848
Is your friend also participating?
Cheon Sang-yeon, was it?

00:53:05.432 --> 00:53:07.350
How do you know her?

00:53:07.934 --> 00:53:10.353
Right, you three had drinks together.

00:53:10.437 --> 00:53:14.024
Take me with you next time.
She's a really close childhood friend.

00:53:14.107 --> 00:53:17.485
You've always been friends,
not just through the club?

00:53:17.569 --> 00:53:19.362
Yes, since elementary school.

00:53:20.572 --> 00:53:24.034
Wow. What an uncanny coincidence.

00:53:25.827 --> 00:53:26.661
I guess.

00:53:29.414 --> 00:53:31.416
Eun-jung, guess what?

00:53:32.250 --> 00:53:35.128
You would never have met Sang-hak
if it weren't for her.

00:53:37.505 --> 00:53:38.381
Sorry?

00:53:38.465 --> 00:53:42.344
If it weren't for her, Sang-hak would
never have gotten into your university.

00:53:42.969 --> 00:53:46.723
Some time ago, she messaged Sang-hak
on her brother's behalf,

00:53:47.557 --> 00:53:50.143
which helped Sang-hak
get his act together.

00:53:52.520 --> 00:53:53.438
A message?

00:53:55.440 --> 00:53:58.652
Yes, a message to say
that her brother was doing well.

00:53:59.861 --> 00:54:03.448
At the time,
we all thought that Moonee had sent it.

00:54:04.032 --> 00:54:06.618
Sang-hak mentioned seeing Moonee online.

00:54:09.037 --> 00:54:10.580
I do have a crush.

00:54:11.790 --> 00:54:15.335
Someone I met in an online chat room
while I was in Gangneung.

00:54:15.919 --> 00:54:17.128
"Online chat room"?

00:54:17.212 --> 00:54:18.630
It wasn't mutual.

00:54:18.713 --> 00:54:20.924
Do you know what he looks like?

00:54:21.508 --> 00:54:22.342
Yes.

00:54:23.843 --> 00:54:24.886
I followed him around.

00:54:26.513 --> 00:54:27.973
What exhibition was this?

00:54:28.056 --> 00:54:29.057
Oh, this.

00:54:29.641 --> 00:54:32.352
It was with a club I was in
during my gap year.

00:54:32.435 --> 00:54:33.270
Why?

00:54:34.145 --> 00:54:38.692
Oh, it's nothing.
I thought it might be someone I know.

00:55:08.638 --> 00:55:10.181
I do have a crush.

00:55:12.100 --> 00:55:13.518
It wasn't mutual.

00:55:15.729 --> 00:55:17.188
I followed him around.

00:55:33.621 --> 00:55:34.998
What are you doing in here?

00:55:36.708 --> 00:55:38.460
I was looking at this photo.

00:55:44.883 --> 00:55:46.634
Do you like him?

00:55:55.185 --> 00:55:56.936
Do you like Sang-hak?

00:59:40.702 --> 00:59:45.707
