00:00:22.105 --> 00:00:24.524
Wait, Eun-jung. It's not like that.

00:00:24.607 --> 00:00:27.152
My feelings for you haven't changed.

00:00:27.652 --> 00:00:29.821
I don't know why I'm acting like this.

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:36.369
So please… just give me some time.

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:37.871
Time for what?

00:00:41.374 --> 00:00:44.252
To decide
whether you like me or Sang-yeon?

00:00:51.509 --> 00:00:52.635
I'm not doing that.

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:57.724
When you turned your phone off…

00:01:00.602 --> 00:01:02.479
you already made your decision.

00:01:34.135 --> 00:01:36.346
Eun-jung, we need to talk.

00:01:39.974 --> 00:01:41.935
-Yesterday, I--
-You don't have to explain.

00:01:44.938 --> 00:01:46.648
I broke up with him.

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:13.109
YOU AND EVERYTHING ELSE

00:03:15.278 --> 00:03:16.446
What about Eun-jung?

00:03:16.529 --> 00:03:20.491
She was supposed to work the front desk
this morning, but she didn't show up.

00:03:32.253 --> 00:03:37.258
I'll head over there now.
Please call me if she shows up.

00:04:01.991 --> 00:04:04.244
SENDER
PRIVATE KIM SANG-HAK

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:20.009
It's nothing, Mrs. Jang.

00:04:20.093 --> 00:04:23.429
She was gone when I woke up,
so I thought I'd ask you.

00:04:24.347 --> 00:04:25.306
Right, thank you.

00:04:29.894 --> 00:04:31.104
Seonbae, where are you?

00:04:35.858 --> 00:04:37.485
Eun-jung's not at home.

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:41.322
A-ra called you too, didn't she?

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:43.992
When did she leave?

00:04:44.075 --> 00:04:46.077
What happened between you two yesterday?

00:05:27.118 --> 00:05:28.911
Is everything okay with Eun-jung?

00:05:29.412 --> 00:05:31.831
I called Sang-hak,
and he stumbled over his words.

00:05:32.332 --> 00:05:35.168
They looked so in love yesterday.
Did they argue or something?

00:05:37.003 --> 00:05:38.296
I'm not sure either.

00:05:38.796 --> 00:05:39.672
Okay.

00:05:39.756 --> 00:05:42.091
Please refill those pamphlets. Thanks!

00:05:42.175 --> 00:05:43.009
Sure.

00:05:47.472 --> 00:05:49.849
I wanted to stop my mind racing.

00:05:51.225 --> 00:05:55.313
If I couldn't stop it…
I needed someone to blame.

00:05:57.148 --> 00:05:58.566
This was your fault.

00:06:01.694 --> 00:06:03.488
What you did to me was wrong.

00:06:11.371 --> 00:06:12.747
When I get discharged…

00:06:15.833 --> 00:06:17.126
let's come back here.

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:23.341
I like you so much.

00:06:28.137 --> 00:06:30.973
How many times must I relive
these memories before they fade?

00:06:35.395 --> 00:06:37.438
Will they ever fade away?

00:07:05.675 --> 00:07:07.218
I guess she's still not back.

00:07:11.848 --> 00:07:14.392
You should go.
I'll text you if she comes home.

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:16.394
Okay.

00:07:39.333 --> 00:07:43.254
Where on earth are you?
Do you know how worried I've…

00:08:11.073 --> 00:08:13.075
-Just go.
-Can we please talk?

00:08:14.535 --> 00:08:16.537
Don't come to the exhibit today.

00:08:19.123 --> 00:08:20.208
Eun-jung.

00:08:27.548 --> 00:08:29.342
Where on earth were you?

00:08:30.259 --> 00:08:31.260
In the mountains.

00:08:34.347 --> 00:08:35.306
What about seonbae?

00:08:38.059 --> 00:08:39.227
I told him to go.

00:08:39.727 --> 00:08:42.897
You should get some sleep.
We need to pack up the exhibit later.

00:08:43.397 --> 00:08:45.775
-That's not important now.
-Then what is?

00:08:48.611 --> 00:08:50.863
If there's a misunderstanding,
let's clear it up.

00:08:51.948 --> 00:08:54.033
He didn't come because he likes me.

00:08:55.076 --> 00:08:57.745
He came out of pity.
There's nothing between us.

00:08:57.828 --> 00:09:01.582
Did you say
the guy you liked is a guitarist?

00:09:03.334 --> 00:09:06.379
A guy who's left-handed
and dropped out of school?

00:09:12.009 --> 00:09:13.135
You're right.

00:09:13.761 --> 00:09:15.388
I had feelings for Sang-hak.

00:09:16.973 --> 00:09:19.850
But he didn't. I secretly liked him.

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:23.104
Is that so wrong--

00:09:23.187 --> 00:09:25.022
I never said it was wrong.

00:09:26.148 --> 00:09:27.567
You're free to like him.

00:09:29.068 --> 00:09:31.153
But I'm angry

00:09:32.863 --> 00:09:35.866
because you saw me
as an obstacle between you two.

00:09:40.663 --> 00:09:44.000
I'm sorry.
Sorry for not telling you sooner.

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:48.087
But you're the one he likes.

00:09:48.838 --> 00:09:51.757
He told me that he likes you
and would never break--

00:09:51.841 --> 00:09:54.176
The person you should be telling me about…

00:09:58.431 --> 00:10:00.850
isn't him but you.

00:10:04.937 --> 00:10:06.856
Why didn't you tell me about your brother?

00:10:11.736 --> 00:10:13.613
If you had just told me,

00:10:14.113 --> 00:10:18.284
I would have happily allowed you two
to go farther than Jecheon.

00:10:18.367 --> 00:10:19.994
I didn't want to tell you.

00:10:24.832 --> 00:10:25.666
Why?

00:10:33.883 --> 00:10:35.551
You should have told me.

00:10:38.804 --> 00:10:40.640
I waited so long for you to tell me.

00:10:42.683 --> 00:10:44.560
I've tiptoed around you,

00:10:45.811 --> 00:10:47.980
afraid of opening up old wounds.

00:10:50.441 --> 00:10:54.862
Your brother was just an excuse
to spend more time with him.

00:10:58.199 --> 00:11:01.869
Okay, you're right.
While there were also other reasons…

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:05.581
I'll admit I wanted that.

00:11:07.375 --> 00:11:10.836
But he came all the way to Jecheon
for good reason.

00:11:11.337 --> 00:11:12.380
He doesn't like me--

00:11:12.463 --> 00:11:14.757
What would be a good enough reason…

00:11:17.385 --> 00:11:21.555
for him to rush to you
without a single word to me?

00:11:27.395 --> 00:11:28.813
Are we even friends?

00:11:33.859 --> 00:11:34.735
Eun-jung.

00:11:34.819 --> 00:11:37.154
Don't ever mention him to me again.

00:11:39.031 --> 00:11:40.783
Our issues are between him and me.

00:11:55.548 --> 00:11:56.549
-Here.
-Thanks.

00:11:59.719 --> 00:12:00.720
Coming, Eun-jung?

00:12:02.096 --> 00:12:03.472
I'm tired, so I'll head--

00:12:03.556 --> 00:12:07.893
No way! You ditched yesterday.
You can't miss the wrap party too.

00:12:07.977 --> 00:12:11.772
Not a chance. We'll be right back
after returning these, so watch her.

00:12:11.856 --> 00:12:12.857
-Sure!
-Let's go.

00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:15.025
-Okay.
-We'll handle the drop-off.

00:12:16.152 --> 00:12:18.320
In exchange, can we skip the wrap party?

00:12:19.071 --> 00:12:20.781
I was hoping to squeeze in a date.

00:12:21.741 --> 00:12:24.827
A date?
Now that's the one exception we can make.

00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:25.745
I'm jealous.

00:12:25.828 --> 00:12:27.705
-Let's leave them to it.
-Okay.

00:12:27.788 --> 00:12:30.833
-Cheers!
-Great job, everyone.

00:12:30.916 --> 00:12:33.002
Our rookie members all did great work.

00:12:35.129 --> 00:12:37.840
We did great, guys.
How was the turnout again?

00:12:37.923 --> 00:12:40.217
I'd say almost 200 people.

00:12:40.801 --> 00:12:42.136
Why did you two argue?

00:12:43.471 --> 00:12:44.805
Just let it go.

00:12:44.889 --> 00:12:47.099
I can't do that. Was it serious?

00:12:47.183 --> 00:12:50.269
Why else would you go MIA,
and why isn't he here?

00:12:50.352 --> 00:12:53.022
I'm asking you to just let it go.

00:12:54.815 --> 00:12:55.900
Hey, Eun-jung.

00:12:55.983 --> 00:13:00.654
Let's display Sang-hak's and your photos
in the clubroom as a couple's display--

00:13:00.738 --> 00:13:01.781
No, please don't.

00:13:04.784 --> 00:13:05.618
Why not?

00:13:06.368 --> 00:13:09.497
Our faces are too exposed
in those photos, and--

00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:12.500
What, did you two split up or something?

00:13:13.876 --> 00:13:16.045
Come on, cut it out.

00:13:16.128 --> 00:13:20.174
It's just a couple of photos.
Overreacting much?

00:13:20.257 --> 00:13:24.261
Hyeon-guk, a breakup isn't something
to be taken so lightly.

00:13:24.345 --> 00:13:26.972
-He's single, so he wouldn't know.
-Isn't that right?

00:13:27.056 --> 00:13:31.560
Everyone, just drink up.
If you keep prying, I'm going to leave.

00:13:31.644 --> 00:13:32.853
No, you can't leave!

00:13:32.937 --> 00:13:35.105
-Don't go. We're sorry.
-Stop talking about her.

00:13:35.189 --> 00:13:36.482
Let's drink.

00:13:39.109 --> 00:13:40.528
Man, I'm going to puke.

00:13:41.695 --> 00:13:45.115
-Why is no one eating the food we ordered?
-That hit the spot.

00:13:45.199 --> 00:13:47.284
I got a flower.

00:13:48.202 --> 00:13:50.496
-You know A-ra doesn't like you, right?
-How cute.

00:13:50.579 --> 00:13:52.206
I have a flower in my hair.

00:13:52.289 --> 00:13:55.543
That night, I learned the reality
of dating in college…

00:13:57.545 --> 00:14:01.382
and I came to the realization
that no one can ever be

00:14:02.883 --> 00:14:04.510
exclusively mine.

00:14:06.887 --> 00:14:11.100
Why should I sober up
when I'm perfectly fine? See?

00:14:12.268 --> 00:14:13.727
-I'm not drunk at all--
-Sang-hak!

00:14:14.228 --> 00:14:16.730
I called him for you. I'm off now.

00:14:17.231 --> 00:14:19.316
You're not children. Quit fighting.

00:14:25.948 --> 00:14:26.991
I'll call a cab.

00:14:27.074 --> 00:14:27.992
Let go.

00:14:52.099 --> 00:14:53.309
Why Sang-yeon?

00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:58.022
Why did it have to be her?

00:14:58.105 --> 00:15:00.399
I'm sorry, Eun-jung. It's all my fault.

00:15:02.359 --> 00:15:05.279
She likes you too.

00:15:06.989 --> 00:15:10.701
I said, Sang-yeon likes you too.

00:15:12.745 --> 00:15:13.954
But so what?

00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:17.875
Why would that matter?

00:15:20.544 --> 00:15:23.047
It wouldn't have mattered
if you had stayed strong!

00:15:23.547 --> 00:15:26.175
If only you hadn't let her sway you!

00:15:26.258 --> 00:15:28.218
Why would you let that happen?

00:15:28.302 --> 00:15:29.219
Why?

00:15:29.887 --> 00:15:32.014
I told you I didn't want to see you.

00:15:37.144 --> 00:15:38.103
Go.

00:15:42.775 --> 00:15:43.734
Just go.

00:16:54.096 --> 00:16:57.057
I'LL BE AT MY MOM'S FOR A WHILE

00:17:27.421 --> 00:17:29.006
You should have told me.

00:17:31.675 --> 00:17:33.927
I waited so long for you to tell me.

00:17:35.554 --> 00:17:37.431
I've tiptoed around you,

00:17:39.141 --> 00:17:41.101
afraid of opening up old wounds.

00:18:02.081 --> 00:18:03.373
That's why he came.

00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:09.004
Because he knew everything.

00:18:14.259 --> 00:18:17.721
In other words, I didn't have a brother.

00:18:19.932 --> 00:18:21.600
I had a sister.

00:18:32.528 --> 00:18:35.739
Knowing this,
can you still not forgive him?

00:18:41.245 --> 00:18:42.996
Just blame me instead.

00:18:43.831 --> 00:18:44.915
Call me a bitch.

00:18:51.171 --> 00:18:53.257
I honestly wish I could do that.

00:18:54.925 --> 00:18:56.760
Things would be so much simpler

00:18:58.428 --> 00:19:00.472
if you had tried to steal him from me.

00:19:10.274 --> 00:19:12.109
Is breaking up the only option?

00:19:19.867 --> 00:19:21.243
You don't understand.

00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:26.707
You don't know what he meant to me…

00:19:29.293 --> 00:19:31.712
and the times we shared together.

00:19:36.425 --> 00:19:41.013
The fact that someone so special
could do something like that to me…

00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:48.770
In other words,

00:19:50.731 --> 00:19:52.316
I had a sister.

00:19:56.195 --> 00:19:59.323
Knowing this,
can you still not forgive him?

00:20:00.574 --> 00:20:03.827
Ms. Ryu, what does this mean?

00:20:05.204 --> 00:20:10.334
Right, look here.
If we read the excerpt closely…

00:20:11.835 --> 00:20:12.669
The last one.

00:20:13.795 --> 00:20:15.047
Okay.

00:20:15.130 --> 00:20:17.257
Hey, Sang-hak. Are you out on leave?

00:20:18.258 --> 00:20:19.927
-Hello, sir.
-You look great.

00:20:20.886 --> 00:20:22.471
All right. Have fun, you two.

00:20:40.447 --> 00:20:42.658
Can't you forgive me just this once?

00:20:47.079 --> 00:20:49.122
I know that I made a mistake…

00:20:51.625 --> 00:20:54.044
and I know I'm being incredibly selfish.

00:20:56.838 --> 00:20:57.673
That's why…

00:20:59.675 --> 00:21:02.010
I really want to do everything you ask…

00:21:09.559 --> 00:21:11.103
but I just can't say that.

00:21:18.193 --> 00:21:19.319
What about

00:21:21.113 --> 00:21:22.948
Sang-yeon did you like?

00:21:25.409 --> 00:21:26.785
Eun-jung, please.

00:21:28.662 --> 00:21:29.955
I'm just curious.

00:21:41.133 --> 00:21:42.634
I think my heart ached…

00:21:44.886 --> 00:21:46.096
whenever I saw her…

00:21:48.473 --> 00:21:51.476
even though I knew
there was nothing I could do for her.

00:21:59.568 --> 00:22:00.902
She came to see me.

00:22:04.614 --> 00:22:06.408
She told me about her brother.

00:22:09.119 --> 00:22:11.496
She asked
if I still couldn't understand you.

00:22:16.335 --> 00:22:17.294
I do understand.

00:22:18.795 --> 00:22:22.924
I know what you mean
when you say your heart ached for her.

00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:36.980
But do you think
those feelings will ever fade with time?

00:22:40.525 --> 00:22:42.944
You know how much I care for you.

00:22:43.028 --> 00:22:43.945
I'm not sure…

00:22:48.909 --> 00:22:50.369
if I can handle it.

00:22:53.830 --> 00:22:56.541
I went for a run every day.

00:22:59.044 --> 00:23:03.840
I knew you wouldn't write to campus again
after I asked you not to.

00:23:06.051 --> 00:23:10.847
But I ran every day
to check the Engineering mailbox.

00:23:15.268 --> 00:23:16.436
I don't think…

00:23:19.606 --> 00:23:21.358
I could ever stop doing that.

00:23:24.736 --> 00:23:26.822
Maybe I cared too deeply for you.

00:23:28.615 --> 00:23:33.662
Maybe I liked you so much
that I've lost the strength to continue.

00:23:38.083 --> 00:23:41.336
We can't go back to the way things were.

00:23:49.386 --> 00:23:51.221
What if a lot of time passes?

00:23:56.393 --> 00:23:59.229
What if I wait for you until then?

00:24:03.066 --> 00:24:04.484
It's just too painful

00:24:06.319 --> 00:24:07.612
to even think about.

00:24:09.781 --> 00:24:11.283
I just want to stop.

00:24:14.744 --> 00:24:16.413
Let's just end things here.

00:26:00.684 --> 00:26:02.102
Are you going back tomorrow?

00:26:08.775 --> 00:26:10.068
Did you…

00:26:12.571 --> 00:26:13.780
get to see Eun-jung?

00:26:16.283 --> 00:26:17.117
Yes.

00:26:21.997 --> 00:26:23.248
Stop by the clubroom.

00:26:24.958 --> 00:26:26.459
Your photos look great.

00:26:28.253 --> 00:26:30.088
Take care on your way back.

00:26:31.298 --> 00:26:32.132
You too.

00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:34.801
I wish you well.

00:26:40.432 --> 00:26:41.349
Seonbae.

00:26:47.647 --> 00:26:48.523
I'm sorry.

00:26:55.739 --> 00:26:56.615
I was…

00:26:59.784 --> 00:27:00.869
You should get that.

00:27:14.382 --> 00:27:15.300
Hello?

00:27:18.094 --> 00:27:19.179
Sorry, paramedics?

00:27:23.350 --> 00:27:24.517
My mom?

00:27:27.270 --> 00:27:30.690
Yes, okay. I'll head there now.
Right now, I'm…

00:27:31.608 --> 00:27:32.609
I'm in Seoul.

00:27:33.902 --> 00:27:34.736
All right.

00:27:34.819 --> 00:27:36.279
Is your mom okay?

00:27:37.947 --> 00:27:39.616
She fainted on the street.

00:27:43.453 --> 00:27:44.454
Taxi!

00:27:44.954 --> 00:27:45.789
Sang-yeon!

00:28:02.847 --> 00:28:05.058
Mom, are you all right?

00:28:06.893 --> 00:28:08.144
How did you get here?

00:28:08.228 --> 00:28:09.813
What did the doctor say?

00:28:11.231 --> 00:28:13.274
I just felt slightly dizzy.

00:28:13.358 --> 00:28:15.735
Who faints because they're a little dizzy?

00:28:15.819 --> 00:28:20.115
They took a CT scan, and I'm fine.
I can leave once this IV drip is done.

00:28:27.914 --> 00:28:31.751
Oh dear. I'm sorry
you had to come all the way here.

00:28:42.762 --> 00:28:45.348
Ms. Yoon Hyun-sook's card
seems to have been suspended.

00:28:45.432 --> 00:28:46.766
Can we try something else?

00:28:50.353 --> 00:28:51.479
One moment, please.

00:28:56.651 --> 00:28:59.696
MEDICAL BILL
AMOUNT DUE: 542,850 WON

00:28:59.779 --> 00:29:04.075
ACCOUNT BALANCE: 43,213 WON

00:29:10.373 --> 00:29:13.626
Of course, Uncle.
I know things aren't easy for you.

00:29:20.258 --> 00:29:24.387
If you could lend me some money
for a week, no, a few days, I'll…

00:29:27.766 --> 00:29:29.392
Isn't she family to you?

00:29:30.935 --> 00:29:34.898
We're talking about
your one and only younger sister here!

00:29:46.409 --> 00:29:50.246
EUN-JUNG'S MOM

00:29:57.921 --> 00:30:00.757
Let's go. She's good to go.

00:30:01.966 --> 00:30:03.218
I took care of the bill.

00:30:38.002 --> 00:30:39.754
Can I have the receipt?

00:30:46.970 --> 00:30:48.012
Please.

00:31:11.286 --> 00:31:12.620
And your bank account details.

00:31:15.415 --> 00:31:17.709
-We'll handle it later--
-There won't be a later.

00:31:20.044 --> 00:31:21.963
I'll pay you back in two months.

00:31:23.256 --> 00:31:24.591
How much was the cab?

00:31:24.674 --> 00:31:26.301
Can't you just accept some help?

00:31:26.384 --> 00:31:27.343
I don't want to.

00:31:29.387 --> 00:31:30.430
Not from you.

00:31:52.285 --> 00:31:55.079
I'll wire a decent amount for the cab.

00:32:26.319 --> 00:32:27.403
I hate myself too…

00:32:30.114 --> 00:32:31.240
for being this way.

00:32:37.830 --> 00:32:39.082
It's all my fault.

00:32:41.793 --> 00:32:42.961
I met that woman.

00:32:52.387 --> 00:32:53.972
You knew, didn't you?

00:32:55.807 --> 00:32:58.184
You've known ever since he was a kid.

00:33:06.901 --> 00:33:08.653
If you loved him so dearly,

00:33:10.029 --> 00:33:11.698
why couldn't you accept him?

00:33:24.794 --> 00:33:26.337
You killed him, Mom.

00:34:15.845 --> 00:34:21.184
MARCH 2003, FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL YEAR

00:34:21.976 --> 00:34:22.977
Hey!

00:34:23.478 --> 00:34:26.314
-I'm late. See you at the clubroom later!
-Sure.

00:35:00.848 --> 00:35:02.433
Are you at school?

00:35:03.267 --> 00:35:05.895
Will you be coming home today…

00:35:30.962 --> 00:35:34.048
Hey. I was just watering the plants.

00:35:40.847 --> 00:35:42.348
-A semester off?
-Yeah.

00:35:43.432 --> 00:35:45.268
I get why you shouldn't date in college.

00:35:46.352 --> 00:35:49.063
I'm not ready to face everyone just yet.

00:35:49.647 --> 00:35:53.985
Now that I'm a junior, I should prepare
for job hunting and study English.

00:35:57.029 --> 00:35:58.865
I'll find a new place soon.

00:36:00.825 --> 00:36:02.368
Why would you do that?

00:36:04.245 --> 00:36:06.956
I'll still pitch in for the rent.

00:36:09.041 --> 00:36:10.918
You won't even be living here.

00:36:11.002 --> 00:36:14.964
I wanted us to move in together,
and the lease isn't up yet.

00:36:15.756 --> 00:36:17.466
It's fine. I'll find a place.

00:36:25.266 --> 00:36:26.100
Sang-yeon.

00:36:29.812 --> 00:36:32.064
You feel awkward around me, don't you?

00:36:37.904 --> 00:36:39.822
I still feel awkward around you.

00:36:43.951 --> 00:36:44.911
Even so,

00:36:46.245 --> 00:36:47.788
are you not going to see me again?

00:36:51.167 --> 00:36:53.377
Of course I still plan on seeing you.

00:36:57.131 --> 00:36:58.507
But having you pay rent is…

00:37:03.554 --> 00:37:05.848
I've only taken from you until now.

00:37:10.519 --> 00:37:12.521
Come on, that's not true.

00:37:13.606 --> 00:37:15.650
Remember when we would rent comic books,

00:37:15.733 --> 00:37:20.112
eat tteokbokki,
and play DDR at the arcade?

00:37:20.196 --> 00:37:21.739
Who paid for all of that?

00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:25.826
If I only had 500 won or 1,000 won,
that's how much I would pay.

00:37:26.327 --> 00:37:28.454
When I had no money, I paid nothing.

00:37:28.996 --> 00:37:30.373
You covered everything.

00:37:32.458 --> 00:37:36.337
Why can't you remember
the things you've done for me?

00:37:40.633 --> 00:37:42.426
I believe these have been…

00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:49.558
some of the toughest years of your life.

00:37:52.436 --> 00:37:54.605
But I know things will improve for you.

00:37:58.442 --> 00:38:00.945
I'm so glad
we reconnected during this time

00:38:01.988 --> 00:38:05.157
and that I can be of any help,
no matter how small.

00:38:08.452 --> 00:38:10.162
So you should just stay.

00:38:11.038 --> 00:38:14.792
I know you'll eventually pay me back,
even if I ask you not to.

00:38:24.176 --> 00:38:26.804
LEAVE OF ABSENCE, RE-ENROLLMENT

00:38:31.809 --> 00:38:32.727
Here you go.

00:38:38.399 --> 00:38:41.277
No wonder. I was getting a weird vibe.

00:38:43.446 --> 00:38:46.157
As expected of the dating expert.
Did you already know?

00:38:47.325 --> 00:38:50.244
Of course not.
Who would have seen this coming?

00:38:50.995 --> 00:38:52.705
I can't believe you broke up.

00:38:54.707 --> 00:38:59.253
But do you have to take a semester off?
What will I do without you?

00:39:00.504 --> 00:39:04.342
We can still hang out.
It's not like I'm moving overseas.

00:39:32.703 --> 00:39:35.414
Ms. Cheon,
I've wired you the tutoring fee just now.

00:39:37.541 --> 00:39:42.088
April 11th. Ms. Yeon Ju-mi
credited your account with 200,000 won.

00:39:44.131 --> 00:39:50.388
April 7th, 2003. Ms. Ryu Eun-jung
credited your account with 150,000 won.

00:40:08.656 --> 00:40:10.533
RYU EUN-JUNG (HANBIT BANK)

00:40:12.743 --> 00:40:16.122
Please enter the recipient's
account number for the transfer.

00:40:58.622 --> 00:41:02.168
The cancer has already spread
to her bones, lungs, and brain.

00:41:02.668 --> 00:41:06.464
We can try chemotherapy, but the chances
of improving her prognosis are slim.

00:41:08.299 --> 00:41:13.012
At this stage, the best course of action
would be to focus on managing her pain

00:41:13.095 --> 00:41:15.473
and try to ease her suffering.

00:41:31.447 --> 00:41:33.282
You already knew, didn't you?

00:41:41.290 --> 00:41:43.083
Did you speak with the doctor?

00:41:58.641 --> 00:42:00.392
I'm okay.

00:42:13.697 --> 00:42:14.949
Mom.

00:42:18.077 --> 00:42:19.495
How can you…

00:42:21.038 --> 00:42:23.791
how can you do this to me
until the very end?

00:42:26.502 --> 00:42:28.712
You're truly the worst.

00:42:33.467 --> 00:42:35.761
I shouldn't even call you "Mom."

00:42:56.198 --> 00:42:57.616
I'm sorry

00:42:59.368 --> 00:43:00.703
for making you feel alone.

00:43:14.633 --> 00:43:16.760
She has three months left, at most.

00:43:17.636 --> 00:43:20.681
I'm deeply sorry,
but you should prepare for what's coming.

00:43:52.046 --> 00:43:53.547
MISSED CALL
SANG-YEON

00:44:16.570 --> 00:44:19.615
The number you have dialed
is currently unavailable.

00:44:19.698 --> 00:44:22.034
Please leave a message after the tone.

00:44:51.355 --> 00:44:52.690
What are you up to?

00:44:52.773 --> 00:44:54.983
I'm on my way out to the video store.

00:44:55.567 --> 00:44:59.363
What a life you're living.
Aren't you tired of watching movies?

00:44:59.863 --> 00:45:01.657
If you're jealous, take a semester off.

00:45:01.740 --> 00:45:03.659
Do you know Sang-hak was out on leave?

00:45:04.535 --> 00:45:06.495
Why would I know about that?

00:45:06.578 --> 00:45:08.247
I'm just annoyed.

00:45:08.330 --> 00:45:12.501
I get that it was a short, special leave,
but how could he not even reach out?

00:45:13.001 --> 00:45:15.671
I think he might have
quit the club for good.

00:45:17.297 --> 00:45:18.757
He quit the club?

00:45:18.841 --> 00:45:22.136
He actually cleared out his things
during his last leave.

00:45:22.636 --> 00:45:24.638
Probably doesn't want you to feel awkward.

00:45:28.058 --> 00:45:29.518
Did you call to tell me that?

00:45:29.601 --> 00:45:30.644
Right.

00:45:32.312 --> 00:45:33.981
Why is Sang-yeon taking a semester off?

00:45:35.774 --> 00:45:37.860
She's taking a semester off?

00:45:40.070 --> 00:45:43.282
Didn't you know? It's been over two weeks.

00:45:45.117 --> 00:45:49.663
Did you two break up because of her?

00:45:50.873 --> 00:45:54.877
I actually saw them get a cab together
when he was last out.

00:45:55.627 --> 00:45:58.172
It seemed pretty serious.

00:46:06.096 --> 00:46:09.433
I need to see you.
I have to tell you something.

00:46:19.026 --> 00:46:20.360
I moved out.

00:46:23.781 --> 00:46:25.157
Why would you move out?

00:46:26.074 --> 00:46:28.327
There are still
two months left on the lease.

00:46:28.952 --> 00:46:32.039
Just because.
I heard my old place is available.

00:46:32.122 --> 00:46:35.501
-Hey, that place is--
-Have a look. It's only 500,000 won.

00:46:36.460 --> 00:46:40.672
I received the deposit,
but something urgent came up.

00:46:42.090 --> 00:46:44.760
Sorry I used some
without discussing it with you.

00:46:49.306 --> 00:46:50.891
I called you to tell you this.

00:46:58.023 --> 00:46:59.066
Is this…

00:47:01.318 --> 00:47:02.528
because of seonbae?

00:47:04.571 --> 00:47:06.657
What does this have to do with him?

00:47:09.034 --> 00:47:11.453
-Forget it, then.
-What do you mean by that?

00:47:13.163 --> 00:47:14.998
What exactly are you implying?

00:47:18.544 --> 00:47:21.338
You were so dedicated to graduating early.

00:47:22.089 --> 00:47:24.675
It's odd that
you're now taking a semester off.

00:47:24.758 --> 00:47:26.844
Do you think I'll date him or something?

00:47:29.763 --> 00:47:30.722
I never said that.

00:47:34.518 --> 00:47:38.438
Besides, we broke up.
That's really none of my business.

00:47:41.525 --> 00:47:45.237
Why did you take the semester off, then?
And what was so urgent?

00:47:48.323 --> 00:47:49.575
Just take the money.

00:47:51.159 --> 00:47:54.955
It may take some time,
but I'll pay everything back.

00:47:55.038 --> 00:47:59.209
I don't know what it is,
but don't tell me now if you'd rather not.

00:48:01.086 --> 00:48:02.629
You don't have to give this to me now.

00:48:05.090 --> 00:48:08.010
You said it was urgent. Just use it.

00:48:08.510 --> 00:48:10.846
I didn't expect to get it back.

00:48:15.517 --> 00:48:17.352
Why wouldn't you expect it back?

00:48:20.772 --> 00:48:22.774
You think I'll be stuck like this forever?

00:48:25.652 --> 00:48:27.321
Why would you say that?

00:48:28.405 --> 00:48:30.574
I already told you.
You can pay me back when--

00:48:30.657 --> 00:48:33.285
How much more miserable
do you want me to be?

00:48:38.165 --> 00:48:41.460
-What do you mean--
-Why are you always so understanding?

00:48:44.129 --> 00:48:45.631
None of your business?

00:48:47.549 --> 00:48:49.801
You were the one who read my diary.

00:48:51.386 --> 00:48:55.766
Deep down,
I know you blame me for your breakup,

00:48:56.725 --> 00:48:57.851
so why the act?

00:48:58.769 --> 00:49:03.065
Does it hurt your pride to admit
that you two broke up because of me?

00:49:04.149 --> 00:49:06.109
Just vent already,

00:49:06.193 --> 00:49:09.446
and stop toying with me.

00:49:13.617 --> 00:49:16.870
You think… I'm toying with you?

00:49:16.954 --> 00:49:21.333
How do you think I felt
every time you sent the monthly rent?

00:49:23.627 --> 00:49:28.382
No one's ever made me loathe myself
the way you do.

00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:35.305
How much more misery
do I need to suffer for you to be happy?

00:49:36.139 --> 00:49:41.937
How much more superior do you need to feel
to heal your wounded pride?

00:49:43.438 --> 00:49:45.899
-Stop it.
-And let me make this clear.

00:49:48.318 --> 00:49:49.903
I don't want Kim Sang-hak.

00:49:50.737 --> 00:49:52.698
He's just a guy, nothing more.

00:49:55.158 --> 00:49:57.369
So stop your whole generous act.

00:49:57.953 --> 00:49:59.955
If you're still so hung up on him…

00:50:01.999 --> 00:50:03.083
he's all yours.

00:50:06.586 --> 00:50:07.671
That's enough.

00:50:07.754 --> 00:50:10.007
I'll pay you back as soon as possible.

00:50:11.466 --> 00:50:13.135
Let's never see each other again.

00:50:25.355 --> 00:50:26.314
Welcome home.

00:50:34.948 --> 00:50:36.908
Oh my! What is this?

00:50:41.246 --> 00:50:42.581
What's the matter?

00:50:45.709 --> 00:50:48.503
Sang-yeon moved out.
She'll pay back the rest later.

00:50:49.212 --> 00:50:50.756
Why would she move out?

00:50:51.423 --> 00:50:54.009
What's going on? Did something happen?

00:50:56.970 --> 00:50:57.804
Eun-jung.

00:51:00.640 --> 00:51:02.392
-Eun-jung?
-I don't know!

00:51:02.476 --> 00:51:04.644
Why should I care what she chooses to do?

00:51:09.691 --> 00:51:11.443
Miss, get us a bottle of soju.

00:51:19.993 --> 00:51:23.872
Why don't you grill our meat for us?
Are you in university?

00:51:28.710 --> 00:51:32.506
A pretty lady like you, yeah?
You sure are working hard.

00:51:34.299 --> 00:51:36.009
-Thank you.
-Uh-huh.

00:51:36.093 --> 00:51:37.844
You sure are pretty.

00:51:53.401 --> 00:51:55.987
Did something happen
between you and Sang-yeon?

00:51:56.863 --> 00:52:01.535
I ran into her outside,
and she just left after handing me this.

00:52:03.036 --> 00:52:06.248
It's a lot of money.
Well over two million won.

00:52:51.376 --> 00:52:52.210
Fine.

00:52:54.045 --> 00:52:56.173
If the friendship I offered you

00:52:57.966 --> 00:53:00.051
and the time we spent together

00:53:01.636 --> 00:53:04.097
meant nothing more to you than this,

00:53:05.348 --> 00:53:06.183
then fine.

00:53:07.893 --> 00:53:09.644
Let's never see each other again.

00:53:21.948 --> 00:53:23.074
That is how

00:53:24.117 --> 00:53:26.077
I ended up severing ties with Sang-yeon

00:53:27.662 --> 00:53:29.956
and vowing never to try

00:53:31.333 --> 00:53:32.751
to understand her again.

00:53:48.433 --> 00:53:49.434
Who is it?

00:53:51.478 --> 00:53:52.896
Who is it?

00:57:32.449 --> 00:57:37.454
