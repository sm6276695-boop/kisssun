00:01:18.279 --> 00:01:21.199
Mr. Jiang, since you reached out to me,

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.399
I guess you've come around

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.518
and decided to work with me.

00:01:25.519 --> 00:01:28.509
I do have a task for you.

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:30.469
Once it's done,

00:01:30.839 --> 00:01:32.159
apart from sending you away,

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:33.590
there are some other benefits for you.

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.390
Considering how generous this offer is,

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:38.950
I'm afraid

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:41.629
it's nothing simple.

00:01:41.839 --> 00:01:43.069
I want you

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.509
to get rid of Pei Yuze.

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:36.509
You'll stop pretending, huh?

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:40.709
You surrendered first last night.

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:43.469
What are you talking about?

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:44.798
I don't get it.

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:45.949
You don't get it?

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:48.629
If so...

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.230
Let's jot your memory.

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:53.239
Stop it!

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:54.270
I'll jot your memory.

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:58.349
Second Master,
you have a call from Mr. Wen.

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.639
Did you hear that?
Second Master, you have a call to answer.

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:05.870
"You have a call to answer."

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.118
Actually, Yuze and I can manage it.

00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:24.920
You need not join us for the operation.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.038
Wen Yuan isn't around,
so I don't feel at ease.

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:30.190
After sending you to the suburb
and meeting Wen Xuan, I'll leave.

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:33.440
Wen Xuan's investigation
has led to a cousin of mine,

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.149
who used to be a head candidate too.

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.470
He studied medicine abroad.

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:39.469
He was at Pei Residence
not long before my poisoning.

00:03:39.839 --> 00:03:43.709
I hope we can really find the lead
to the antidote.

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:53.118
Granny!

00:03:53.119 --> 00:03:54.309
Are you alright?

00:03:55.119 --> 00:03:56.518
I'm sorry

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:57.959
for having blocked your way.

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:59.270
Not at all.

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:02.879
Jin Se, send the old lady home first.

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.149
We'll wait for you here.

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:05.679
Sure.

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:06.630
Slowly.

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.070
Let's get some rest
while waiting for her here.

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:24.750
Yuze!

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:25.989
Where's the medicine?

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:35.630
How do you feel?

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.550
It's alright.
I'll be fine after some rest.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.430
Cold... I'm feeling so cold.

00:04:48.559 --> 00:04:49.469
Cold?

00:04:49.599 --> 00:04:50.949
I'll get you a jacket.

00:04:52.279 --> 00:04:53.149

Yuze.

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:05.349
Pei Yuze! Pei Yuze!

00:05:06.559 --> 00:05:08.358
Sir, have you seen this young man

00:05:08.359 --> 00:05:09.318
sitting at the tea stall?

00:05:09.319 --> 00:05:10.229
No.

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:12.999
Jiang Yao! Jiang Yao, this is bad!

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.099
- Xinruo, what's it with you?
- This is bad. I went to buy Yuze a jacket.

00:05:16.099 --> 00:05:17.919
- When I came down and turned around,
- Calm down.

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:19.159
- Yuze was gone. I...
- Calm down.

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.439
Calm down. I'll have my men
search for him in the city.

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:24.439
Stay at home. I'll let you know
at once if there's any news.

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:26.590
No, that's not enough. The suburb...

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:28.358
That's right.
I'll look for him in the suburb.

00:05:28.359 --> 00:05:29.869
Xinruo. Xinruo!

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:31.759
You heard that, butler.

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:32.518
Go look for him!

00:05:32.519 --> 00:05:33.919
Sure...

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:35.790
- Second Master!
- Second Master!

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:37.750
Have you seen this man?

00:05:38.279 --> 00:05:39.558
Have you seen this man?

00:05:39.559 --> 00:05:40.629
No.

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:44.079
Miss, excuse me.
May I know if you've seen this man?

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:44.919
He's about this tall.

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:46.190
- No.
- I haven't seen him.

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:48.479
Excuse me, miss.

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:49.679
Have you seen this man?

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:50.399
No.

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:51.359
Please try to recall it.

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:52.709
No, I truly haven't seen him.

00:05:54.079 --> 00:05:56.189
Sir, may I know
if you've seen this man?

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:57.030
No.

00:05:59.279 --> 00:06:00.229
Xinruo.

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:02.078
The night is falling.

00:06:02.079 --> 00:06:02.838
Head home now.

00:06:02.839 --> 00:06:04.029
I'll keep looking for him.

00:06:04.119 --> 00:06:05.639
You may head back if you want to.

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:06.750
I'll look for him.

00:06:08.799 --> 00:06:10.469
Xinruo. Xinruo!

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:14.299
(Old Fengxiang Jewelry Store)

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:18.610
(Pei Residence)

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:22.520
Miss Xinruo has had a cold.

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:24.240
Also, she's physically
and mentally exhausted.

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:26.640
I'll get her a prescription.
She'll be fine after a few days of rest.

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:28.029
Thank you, Dr. Fang.

00:06:35.839 --> 00:06:38.309
Xinruo, be patient

00:06:38.599 --> 00:06:39.679
and rest well.

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:41.750
Just leave the rest to me.

00:07:24.039 --> 00:07:25.309
Master Jiang!

00:07:26.799 --> 00:07:29.358
Master Jiang. Master Jiang, this is bad!

00:07:29.359 --> 00:07:30.758
Miss Lian insists on going out

00:07:30.759 --> 00:07:32.469
and we can't stop her!

00:07:33.319 --> 00:07:35.000
Xinruo, you're still sick.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.598
Go back to your room
and get some rest.

00:07:36.599 --> 00:07:37.598
Please leave me alone.

00:07:37.599 --> 00:07:40.469
Xinruo, where are you going
at this late hour?

00:07:41.279 --> 00:07:42.719
I beg of you, please leave me alone.

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:43.559
I'll feel on edge

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:45.199
until Yuze is found.

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:46.078
Xinruo.

00:07:46.079 --> 00:07:47.669
Pei Yuze might be...

00:07:48.079 --> 00:07:49.149
Xinruo.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.278
Where have you been?

00:08:02.279 --> 00:08:03.919
I thought I...

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:06.558
Don't worry. See, I'm all fine.

00:08:06.559 --> 00:08:07.518
It was all my fault.

00:08:07.519 --> 00:08:08.798
I was to blame for it.

00:08:08.799 --> 00:08:10.078
When I turned around,

00:08:10.079 --> 00:08:11.558
I found out that you were gone.

00:08:11.559 --> 00:08:13.278
And I couldn't find you anywhere.

00:08:13.279 --> 00:08:17.430
Don't blame yourself for that.
Then I'll always stay by your side, okay?

00:08:18.159 --> 00:08:20.029
Yuze, I...

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:22.870
Xinruo.

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:23.950
Xinruo!

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:24.830
Xinruo!

00:08:26.239 --> 00:08:27.149
Go away.

00:08:38.839 --> 00:08:40.189
Yuze...

00:08:40.839 --> 00:08:42.829
What exactly happened?

00:08:45.199 --> 00:08:46.629
After you left,

00:08:46.759 --> 00:08:48.749
I was kidnapped
by the two tea stall servers.

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:50.318
They tried to take me out of the city

00:08:50.319 --> 00:08:51.549
and get rid of me.

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:54.070
I got out of the car
when they let their guard down.

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:56.790
Luckily, Wen Yuan found me.

00:08:57.880 --> 00:08:59.718
I'm sorry. I...

00:08:59.719 --> 00:09:01.109
What are you blaming yourself for?

00:09:01.759 --> 00:09:03.109
Get some rest first.

00:09:03.239 --> 00:09:04.549
Have a good sleep.

00:09:17.279 --> 00:09:18.669
Jin Se has gone missing.

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:21.919
Looks like that old lady
we met this afternoon

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:23.670
was in cahoots
with those tea stall servers.

00:09:29.279 --> 00:09:30.638
Come with me.

00:09:30.639 --> 00:09:32.590
- But Second Master, you're still...
- I'm alright.

00:10:05.279 --> 00:10:06.389
Father...

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:09.630
Father...

00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:11.630
Jiao Jiao.

00:10:12.639 --> 00:10:13.789
Jiao Jiao.

00:10:15.199 --> 00:10:16.269
Jiao Jiao.

00:10:17.319 --> 00:10:18.349
Father?

00:10:20.799 --> 00:10:22.709
I've finally seen you again.

00:10:23.759 --> 00:10:27.120
You're already an 18-year-old lady.
Still acting like a little girl, huh?

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:27.910
Oh, right.

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:30.590
Today's your birthday.

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:32.790
Quick, get yourself ready.

00:10:33.199 --> 00:10:35.229
But aren't you...

00:10:35.719 --> 00:10:36.629
What's it?

00:10:39.799 --> 00:10:42.509
I think I had a nightmare.

00:10:42.639 --> 00:10:44.229
I dreamed about your passing.

00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:47.950
Silly girl.

00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:50.158
Go ahead now.

00:10:50.159 --> 00:10:51.549
Yao is waiting for you.

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:54.030
Go on.

00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:05.550
What a lovely strawberry cake!

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:09.238
Where's Mr. Jiang?

00:11:09.239 --> 00:11:10.399
My father is busy.

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:12.829
Let's not wait for him.
Xinruo, blow out the candles now.

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:14.310
Sooner or later,

00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:17.510
you'll have to start calling Mr. Jiang Father.

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:21.399
You're unbelievable, Father!

00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:22.830
Blow out the candles already.

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:25.590
You only get to unwrap your gift
after making a wish.

00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:39.790
You don't deserve Second Master!
Get lost already!

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:43.390
What a shameless liar!

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:45.230
No...

00:11:45.239 --> 00:11:46.509
No!

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:47.870
No!

00:11:48.039 --> 00:11:50.269
- You're that murderer's daughter!
- You're that murderer's daughter!

00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:52.590
Xinruo.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.030
Xinruo.

00:12:06.799 --> 00:12:07.869
Yuze.

00:12:08.159 --> 00:12:10.549
Great! You're finally here!

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.390
Without the antidote,

00:12:13.199 --> 00:12:14.669
I can't hold on much longer.

00:12:15.839 --> 00:12:17.109
I'm leaving.

00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:18.670
Where are you going?

00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:24.510
Yuze!

00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:39.630
Xinruo.

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:41.550
I can't get rid of the poison in me.

00:12:42.159 --> 00:12:43.229
I'm leaving.

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:45.110
Where are you going?

00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:47.350
My days are numbered.

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:49.190
Xinruo.

00:12:49.839 --> 00:12:51.629
Will you still be with me?

00:12:51.759 --> 00:12:52.829
I will.

00:12:53.239 --> 00:12:56.389
No matter what your fate is,

00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:59.150
I'll be with you.

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:02.550
Come with me, okay?

00:13:02.839 --> 00:13:04.429
Don't leave me alone.

00:13:09.319 --> 00:13:10.589
Come on.

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:12.510
Here.

00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:23.030
Come.

00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:14.270
Yuze.

00:14:15.359 --> 00:14:17.509
I'll stay by your side.
