00:00:15.473 --> 00:00:16.975
What's the hurry?

00:00:17.058 --> 00:00:18.893
I'm late for the scouting meeting.

00:00:18.977 --> 00:00:20.061
See you.

00:00:20.895 --> 00:00:22.397
I'm sorry I'm late.

00:00:23.064 --> 00:00:25.025
You're right on time, not late.

00:00:25.817 --> 00:00:27.902
All right. Let's get started.

00:00:28.862 --> 00:00:31.781
It's great that the place
is no longer in use,

00:00:31.865 --> 00:00:35.326
but since it was a prayer house,
it doesn't quite feel like an orphanage.

00:00:35.827 --> 00:00:37.787
The building does feel stifling,

00:00:37.871 --> 00:00:41.207
but that enclosed vibe
might work in our favor.

00:00:41.291 --> 00:00:42.834
-It could feel grotesque.
-I agree.

00:00:43.418 --> 00:00:46.046
Placing the director's office
at the end of that corridor

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:49.758
could really work
for Su-jin's panic attack scene.

00:00:51.384 --> 00:00:54.054
Good work, everyone.

00:00:54.637 --> 00:00:56.598
Director Kim,
did you get home late yesterday?

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.516
How did you know?

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.894
After dinner with Director Seo
and Producer Cheon,

00:01:01.394 --> 00:01:03.021
I saw your car pass by.

00:01:03.104 --> 00:01:05.273
Director Lee Chan-seok asked to see me.

00:01:05.356 --> 00:01:07.859
It didn't look like Director Lee
in your passenger seat.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.656
I ran into Producer Ryu at the bus stop,
so I offered her a ride.

00:01:15.575 --> 00:01:16.618
Yes.

00:01:16.701 --> 00:01:19.287
I got a comfy ride home, thanks to him.

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:20.997
So it was Producer Ryu?

00:01:21.081 --> 00:01:23.917
I thought you were on a date
with your girlfriend or something.

00:01:26.336 --> 00:01:28.129
-See you at the location scouting.
-See you.

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:34.260
I guess they're not dating.

00:01:36.012 --> 00:01:37.472
Why would you pry like that?

00:01:38.473 --> 00:01:40.141
You couldn't take your eyes off him.

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:42.602
Do you like him that much?

00:01:44.437 --> 00:01:46.940
That’s why I suggested
we explore other options.

00:01:49.442 --> 00:01:50.944
So you do like him?

00:01:51.903 --> 00:01:54.072
What is so special about him?

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.451
If it weren't for him,
I wouldn't be here right now.

00:01:59.577 --> 00:02:00.578
What do you mean?

00:02:02.288 --> 00:02:05.416
I would have been burned to ashes
when my mom passed away.

00:02:44.914 --> 00:02:48.835
YOU AND EVERYTHING ELSE

00:02:49.627 --> 00:02:51.296
How come you're leaving on the dot?

00:02:51.796 --> 00:02:53.590
I want to see
some of Lee Seung-jae's movies.

00:02:54.215 --> 00:02:56.759
Haven't you seen them all already?

00:02:56.843 --> 00:02:59.721
I want to rewatch some scenes
for our first meeting.

00:02:59.804 --> 00:03:00.722
I see.

00:03:00.805 --> 00:03:01.639
Bye, then.

00:03:01.723 --> 00:03:02.599
Hui-jin.

00:03:03.558 --> 00:03:04.517
Wanna grab a beer?

00:03:05.518 --> 00:03:06.394
Beer?

00:03:07.145 --> 00:03:08.021
Next time.

00:03:08.104 --> 00:03:09.314
I have to take this.

00:03:09.898 --> 00:03:11.107
My boyfriend's waiting.

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:15.153
Bye.

00:03:17.113 --> 00:03:18.489
Fine.

00:03:20.366 --> 00:03:22.076
They're such lovebirds.

00:03:30.668 --> 00:03:32.545
You told Eun-jung you like her?

00:03:34.505 --> 00:03:36.257
No wonder.

00:03:36.341 --> 00:03:39.344
Is that why you insisted I come alone?

00:03:40.053 --> 00:03:42.263
And you never come by
the rooftop these days.

00:03:42.764 --> 00:03:44.140
It's just awkward.

00:03:44.641 --> 00:03:46.184
I'm barely recovering.

00:03:47.352 --> 00:03:49.354
-So she turned you down?
-Flat-out.

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.234
Did she give you the whole
"I'd never date a colleague" spiel?

00:03:54.817 --> 00:03:55.860
No.

00:03:56.527 --> 00:03:57.362
Then what?

00:03:58.154 --> 00:03:59.948
The old me would have said yes

00:04:01.032 --> 00:04:02.867
if a guy like you asked me out.

00:04:04.786 --> 00:04:06.120
But that's not me anymore.

00:04:10.208 --> 00:04:11.209
Why not?

00:04:12.168 --> 00:04:13.753
Because I know how it'll end.

00:04:15.838 --> 00:04:17.840
I've been in three relationships so far.

00:04:19.008 --> 00:04:21.261
Every time a relationship ends,

00:04:21.761 --> 00:04:24.097
you learn more about yourself
than the other person.

00:04:25.556 --> 00:04:27.642
About your faults and flaws.

00:04:29.143 --> 00:04:31.187
So, to elaborate on what I learned…

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:35.316
I can't settle for anything below 100.

00:04:36.317 --> 00:04:37.277
100?

00:04:37.986 --> 00:04:38.820
Yes.

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:43.366
She won't date someone unless she's
100% sure she trusts and likes them.

00:04:44.575 --> 00:04:46.828
I doubt such a person exists for anyone.

00:04:46.911 --> 00:04:49.622
That's why she won't commit.
Because no such person exists.

00:04:49.706 --> 00:04:51.916
And I thought she was smart.

00:04:53.251 --> 00:04:56.004
You can't control matters of the heart.

00:04:57.839 --> 00:05:00.008
What's next for you? Are you giving up?

00:05:00.591 --> 00:05:03.428
Don't be stupid.
Why do you think I asked you to come here?

00:05:04.804 --> 00:05:05.638
Hui-jin.

00:05:07.307 --> 00:05:08.975
I'm going to need your help.

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:18.818
You're co-producers on paper,
but one will end up as the spare.

00:05:18.901 --> 00:05:22.196
What matters is
getting someone powerful on your side.

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:25.033
If the director or lead is backing you,
you're golden.

00:05:31.622 --> 00:05:33.499
Look who it is! How are you?

00:05:35.084 --> 00:05:36.210
Director Gyeong.

00:05:36.294 --> 00:05:39.255
You've been well, I hope?
I loved your last film.

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:40.923
I hope you've been well too.

00:05:41.007 --> 00:05:42.675
Have you met Seung-jae before?

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:46.054
We met at the presser for The Prosecutors.
Pleasure to see you again.

00:05:47.513 --> 00:05:49.515
Right, we did meet then.

00:05:49.599 --> 00:05:50.600
I remember.

00:05:51.851 --> 00:05:54.270
And this here is Producer Ryu Eun-jung.

00:05:54.771 --> 00:05:56.689
-Nice to meet you.
-Hello.

00:05:56.773 --> 00:05:58.900
And that's Producer Cheon Sang-yeon.

00:05:59.442 --> 00:06:02.695
A pleasure. I look forward
to working with you, Mr. Lee.

00:06:04.238 --> 00:06:05.365
Likewise.

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:08.284
Let's sit.

00:06:08.368 --> 00:06:09.494
Please take a seat.

00:06:11.204 --> 00:06:13.790
-Did we keep you waiting?
-No, we just got here.

00:06:18.461 --> 00:06:21.255
Military duty must be a real burden
for male actors.

00:06:21.339 --> 00:06:24.300
Absolutely. Losing two years
at the peak of your career--

00:06:24.384 --> 00:06:25.551
Come on.

00:06:25.635 --> 00:06:27.178
Let's not talk about that.

00:06:35.144 --> 00:06:36.104
Director Gyeong.

00:06:36.187 --> 00:06:39.649
How's the storyboard coming along?
The stunts look intense.

00:06:41.192 --> 00:06:45.196
It'll be a breeze for you
since you’re an action star, after all.

00:06:45.696 --> 00:06:47.156
You rarely use body doubles.

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:49.951
Right, well…

00:06:53.371 --> 00:06:56.666
Every scene with a body double
still counts as yours.

00:06:57.667 --> 00:07:01.504
If the audience believes it’s you,
then it’s you.

00:07:03.214 --> 00:07:05.508
Director Gyeong would be
the first to stop you

00:07:05.591 --> 00:07:07.510
from taking on any dangerous stunts.

00:07:08.678 --> 00:07:09.637
Of course.

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:11.889
The crux of it all
is the emotions you convey.

00:07:20.273 --> 00:07:21.983
Producer Cheon Sang-yeon, was it?

00:07:23.067 --> 00:07:24.485
May I call you Sang-yeon?

00:07:27.697 --> 00:07:30.074
Of course. That would be my honor.

00:07:30.783 --> 00:07:32.952
You should address me casually too.

00:07:34.495 --> 00:07:35.705
Thank you, but

00:07:36.664 --> 00:07:38.040
let's take things slow.

00:07:38.791 --> 00:07:40.209
I will when the time comes.

00:07:43.671 --> 00:07:46.883
I'm sensing a box office hit here.
The vibes are great.

00:07:48.634 --> 00:07:51.512
How do you make people
warm to you so easily?

00:07:51.596 --> 00:07:53.389
The cold Lee Seung-jae, of all people.

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:55.224
It's a secret.

00:07:55.308 --> 00:07:56.476
Secret, my foot.

00:07:56.976 --> 00:07:58.519
They already knew each other.

00:07:59.020 --> 00:07:59.854
What?

00:07:59.937 --> 00:08:03.065
So you acted like strangers on purpose?
When did you two meet?

00:08:03.566 --> 00:08:06.652
Before he was ever Lee Seung-jae.
When he was Lee Seung-yong.

00:08:06.736 --> 00:08:08.613
He'd have hated her letting on the truth.

00:08:10.114 --> 00:08:11.449
What was that about stunts?

00:08:11.532 --> 00:08:14.368
I’ve heard rumors about his bad knee,

00:08:14.452 --> 00:08:16.746
and the look on his face
seemed to confirm it.

00:08:17.538 --> 00:08:19.790
How are you so good at reading people?

00:08:19.874 --> 00:08:21.209
You're a natural.

00:08:22.168 --> 00:08:24.086
It's my job to read people.

00:08:33.846 --> 00:08:35.306
Why are you out here?

00:08:35.389 --> 00:08:36.599
I was moon-gazing.

00:08:37.225 --> 00:08:40.269
I was wondering
whose daughter was looking so down,

00:08:40.353 --> 00:08:41.771
but I guess it was my own.

00:08:44.106 --> 00:08:46.400
What is it? Did something happen?

00:08:47.527 --> 00:08:49.195
I'm just a bit tired.

00:08:51.989 --> 00:08:54.033
Will Sang-yeon ever come to visit?

00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:56.994
Did you mention it at all?

00:08:58.204 --> 00:09:00.540
I would love to feed her
a home-cooked meal.

00:09:01.832 --> 00:09:03.125
Always on about food.

00:09:03.876 --> 00:09:06.087
She isn’t going hungry.

00:09:06.587 --> 00:09:11.008
She eats well and is doing fine,
so stop asking me to bring her home.

00:09:11.509 --> 00:09:13.678
She may be eating well and doing fine,

00:09:13.761 --> 00:09:17.098
but imagine how lonely she must feel
being all alone.

00:09:38.578 --> 00:09:39.620
Come on.

00:09:39.704 --> 00:09:42.623
Couldn't you tell me you were moving?

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:46.127
I have no money, so just go.

00:09:48.379 --> 00:09:49.964
This is really the last time.

00:09:51.173 --> 00:09:54.010
Please help me out, just this once.

00:09:55.261 --> 00:09:56.637
Your old man's facing jail.

00:09:57.471 --> 00:09:58.639
Go to jail, then.

00:10:02.935 --> 00:10:05.605
Damn it. Like mother like daughter.

00:10:58.949 --> 00:11:01.160
Does Producer Cheon come from wealth?

00:11:01.243 --> 00:11:03.245
How does she always dress so well?

00:11:03.913 --> 00:11:05.289
Her clothes aren't expensive.

00:11:05.915 --> 00:11:06.874
They aren't?

00:11:07.875 --> 00:11:09.543
She was like that in university.

00:11:09.627 --> 00:11:12.129
She could make cheap clothes
look expensive.

00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:14.840
-What looks expensive?
-You startled me.

00:11:14.924 --> 00:11:16.342
You scared me.

00:11:16.425 --> 00:11:18.469
Jeez, don't jump out like that.

00:11:18.552 --> 00:11:22.181
Don't tell me you're feeling insecure.
Your outfit looks way pricier.

00:11:22.682 --> 00:11:25.685
Hey, these really were expensive.

00:11:25.768 --> 00:11:28.729
You should just make yourself scarce.

00:11:28.813 --> 00:11:29.647
I'll say.

00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:33.567
The on-location crew gets insecure around
people like you who understand scripts.

00:11:33.651 --> 00:11:35.152
I'm on-location, so I would know.

00:11:35.236 --> 00:11:38.489
Whatever. The script didn't even come up
in the meeting.

00:11:39.073 --> 00:11:41.617
Then, Producer Ryu,
I guess you're the spare.

00:11:43.327 --> 00:11:44.662
Will you please get lost?

00:11:45.788 --> 00:11:47.039
I only just got here.

00:11:51.752 --> 00:11:52.962
Is that Director Gyeong?

00:11:53.462 --> 00:11:54.296
I guess so.

00:11:57.883 --> 00:11:58.884
Yes, Director Gyeong.

00:12:05.766 --> 00:12:06.684
Come on in.

00:12:09.061 --> 00:12:10.229
Please take a seat.

00:12:14.567 --> 00:12:16.777
Why was Producer Ryu called in?

00:12:17.987 --> 00:12:19.697
I don't know. He asked her to come.

00:12:24.326 --> 00:12:25.661
How did you think of that?

00:12:27.246 --> 00:12:29.707
Thanks to you, scene 45 is looking clean.

00:12:30.833 --> 00:12:33.419
I agreed that the scene dragged a bit,

00:12:33.919 --> 00:12:37.673
so I considered ways
to salvage the crucial dialogue…

00:12:41.719 --> 00:12:43.345
I see why Producer Cheon said that.

00:12:44.305 --> 00:12:45.181
Sorry?

00:12:45.806 --> 00:12:48.851
I just mean that I'm impressed.
Thanks for your great input.

00:12:49.518 --> 00:12:50.478
It's nothing.

00:12:51.562 --> 00:12:53.105
Since we're on the topic…

00:13:02.573 --> 00:13:04.116
-Hello.
-Hello.

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:05.242
Hello.

00:13:09.079 --> 00:13:11.832
-Here's the location scouting schedule.
-Right.

00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:19.757
Why haven't you moved your desk yet?

00:13:20.341 --> 00:13:22.760
You should be here with us
during pre-production.

00:13:22.843 --> 00:13:25.429
That way, I can run ideas by you
about the script.

00:13:26.388 --> 00:13:28.724
I could use an executive producer
who shows up.

00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:30.976
Yes, will do.

00:13:43.113 --> 00:13:44.198
Good morning.

00:13:44.698 --> 00:13:45.825
-Good morning.
-Morning.

00:13:45.908 --> 00:13:48.869
I'll take that.
Director Seo's coming on her own.

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:52.706
Hello. Director Gyeong
should be arriving soon.

00:13:53.332 --> 00:13:56.001
-Where will he be sitting?
-Behind the passenger seat.

00:13:56.502 --> 00:13:57.837
Where would you like to sit?

00:13:59.171 --> 00:14:00.005
I'll just sit--

00:14:00.089 --> 00:14:01.715
Next to me, of course.

00:14:02.299 --> 00:14:03.133
Come on.

00:14:04.009 --> 00:14:05.761
Yay, shotgun.

00:14:05.845 --> 00:14:07.346
So you like the front seat?

00:14:07.429 --> 00:14:10.432
-Morning.
-Well, the front is cooler.

00:14:10.516 --> 00:14:11.350
Good morning.

00:14:12.393 --> 00:14:16.605
"Byeonsan, Chuncheon, Sokcho, Yangyang."

00:14:17.731 --> 00:14:19.233
This is a hefty schedule.

00:14:19.316 --> 00:14:20.234
Brace yourself.

00:14:20.317 --> 00:14:22.278
I should be saying that to you.

00:14:27.283 --> 00:14:28.450
Let me check something.

00:15:04.612 --> 00:15:05.613
Just sleep.

00:15:06.614 --> 00:15:08.365
It's okay. I'm not sleepy.

00:15:08.449 --> 00:15:10.409
You should wipe your drool.

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:11.952
I did not drool.

00:15:12.036 --> 00:15:12.995
Take this.

00:15:13.662 --> 00:15:15.456
I told you I'm not sleepy.

00:15:15.539 --> 00:15:16.832
That's really comfy.

00:15:18.542 --> 00:15:19.960
Hey, you're right.

00:15:20.044 --> 00:15:21.837
-Isn't it great?
-It's perfect.

00:15:24.924 --> 00:15:26.258
I think it could work.

00:15:27.468 --> 00:15:28.844
-Is it too narrow?
-No.

00:15:29.345 --> 00:15:31.096
-I think it's that way.
-Yes.

00:15:39.563 --> 00:15:41.315
It's pretty decent.

00:15:42.191 --> 00:15:44.944
All rooms are fully booked,
but I'll secure two for tomorrow.

00:15:45.027 --> 00:15:45.861
It's fine.

00:15:46.362 --> 00:15:48.614
-Director Seo and Hyeon-ju, sorry.
-It's okay.

00:15:48.697 --> 00:15:49.907
-Shall we?
-Let's go.

00:15:50.866 --> 00:15:51.909
It's just for today.

00:15:57.373 --> 00:15:58.832
The film crew's all set.

00:16:06.924 --> 00:16:08.050
Which bed do you want?

00:16:08.550 --> 00:16:10.052
You pick what you like.

00:16:11.804 --> 00:16:13.389
I'll wash up first.

00:16:33.534 --> 00:16:34.910
Are you feeling unwell?

00:16:48.132 --> 00:16:49.133
Sang-yeon.

00:17:01.186 --> 00:17:02.187
Oh dear.

00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:15.951
Do you have any cold medicine
instead of this?

00:17:17.411 --> 00:17:19.413
We're out of cold medicine.

00:17:20.122 --> 00:17:22.916
Then is there a pharmacy
still open nearby?

00:17:23.917 --> 00:17:28.130
Inside Hansarang Geriatric Hospital.
It closes at 10:00 p.m.,

00:17:28.213 --> 00:17:29.339
but it's really far.

00:17:29.423 --> 00:17:30.674
Why the cold medicine?

00:17:32.468 --> 00:17:33.594
Are you unwell?

00:17:35.971 --> 00:17:37.681
-Thank you.
-It's nothing.

00:17:38.474 --> 00:17:39.558
Enjoy your dinner.

00:17:41.351 --> 00:17:43.854
Maybe she caught something?
She seems fine.

00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:53.030
Forget it.

00:18:03.248 --> 00:18:08.087
PHARMACY

00:18:18.055 --> 00:18:19.306
You smoke?

00:18:20.933 --> 00:18:21.975
I do. So what?

00:18:24.228 --> 00:18:27.022
Where have you been this late?
You're drenched in sweat.

00:18:28.315 --> 00:18:29.358
The pharmacy.

00:18:29.441 --> 00:18:30.275
Are you sick?

00:18:31.485 --> 00:18:32.528
It's nothing.

00:18:33.362 --> 00:18:35.864
You always scold us for smoking,

00:18:35.948 --> 00:18:37.825
and you finally quit. Why go back to it?

00:18:37.908 --> 00:18:39.076
I'll put it out.

00:18:43.622 --> 00:18:44.498
Here.

00:18:46.583 --> 00:18:47.751
Cold medicine.

00:18:49.753 --> 00:18:51.130
CHUNCHEON GWANGJAE PHARMACY

00:18:51.213 --> 00:18:52.339
How did you

00:18:53.590 --> 00:18:54.842
manage to get these?

00:18:56.510 --> 00:18:57.678
I just went for a walk.

00:18:58.262 --> 00:19:00.180
You said you weren't sick.
You have a cold?

00:19:01.473 --> 00:19:02.391
Sang-yeon does.

00:19:03.183 --> 00:19:05.018
Thank you. I’ll give these to her.

00:19:07.729 --> 00:19:08.564
Good.

00:19:09.731 --> 00:19:11.233
I'm glad you're not sick.

00:19:18.532 --> 00:19:19.825
Overreacting much?

00:19:21.827 --> 00:19:22.661
Sang-yeon.

00:19:24.288 --> 00:19:25.122
Sang-yeon.

00:19:27.166 --> 00:19:28.208
Can you sit up?

00:19:29.293 --> 00:19:30.919
You should take these.

00:19:58.155 --> 00:19:59.031
Wear this inside.

00:20:03.327 --> 00:20:04.161
Thanks.

00:20:08.582 --> 00:20:09.666
For these too.

00:20:13.086 --> 00:20:16.173
Seonbae bought that.

00:20:32.397 --> 00:20:35.651
Thank you for the medicine yesterday.

00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:39.238
It's nothing. Are you feeling better?

00:20:41.615 --> 00:20:42.449
I see.

00:20:43.325 --> 00:20:45.369
So you were the one with a cold?

00:20:45.452 --> 00:20:49.665
We thought Producer Ryu was ill
since she was looking for cold medicine.

00:21:18.902 --> 00:21:20.070
GWANGJAE PHARMACY

00:21:34.918 --> 00:21:36.712
What are you reading so intently?

00:21:37.671 --> 00:21:39.798
Apparently, Hinuri is shutting down.

00:21:40.424 --> 00:21:41.842
Hinuri was still in service?

00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:46.221
How nostalgic. "Instant messaging."

00:21:59.276 --> 00:22:01.445
Here. Please look around both sides.

00:22:05.157 --> 00:22:06.742
We could use this as is.

00:22:09.411 --> 00:22:11.538
-Hyeon-ju, one moment.
-Yes, sir.

00:22:11.621 --> 00:22:13.123
Let's check out that side.

00:22:14.833 --> 00:22:16.376
We could shoot from there.

00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:17.961
Who has the script?

00:22:18.795 --> 00:22:20.464
I'm pleasantly surprised.

00:22:20.547 --> 00:22:22.424
-The corridor's nice and long.
-Yes.

00:22:23.925 --> 00:22:25.302
It's raining.

00:22:25.802 --> 00:22:26.928
It is.

00:22:27.012 --> 00:22:29.014
The forecast didn’t mention any rain.

00:22:29.765 --> 00:22:32.059
At least we locked in this location
before it hit.

00:22:32.893 --> 00:22:34.269
How many more places left?

00:22:36.688 --> 00:22:39.691
Three spots in the old town
and two in Yangyang for tomorrow.

00:22:41.193 --> 00:22:42.652
For the hideout…

00:22:43.779 --> 00:22:46.573
It looks like the rain won't stop
for another two hours,

00:22:46.656 --> 00:22:50.243
so why don’t we grab a meal nearby
and wait it out at the hotel?

00:22:51.995 --> 00:22:53.205
Let's do that.

00:25:04.628 --> 00:25:06.963

To Sang-yeon.

00:26:39.097 --> 00:26:40.599
When Gilbert Grape

00:26:41.099 --> 00:26:43.518
set his house on fire before leaving,

00:26:44.978 --> 00:26:47.355
he was burning the past
that had held him back.

00:26:48.690 --> 00:26:50.775
He didn’t burn away with it.

00:26:54.070 --> 00:26:55.947
As he ventured to new horizons,

00:26:57.324 --> 00:26:58.908
he carried his loved ones with him…

00:27:01.077 --> 00:27:03.496
never abandoning
or losing anyone along the way.

00:27:09.502 --> 00:27:11.046
Don't set yourself aflame.

00:27:19.638 --> 00:27:23.058
HINURI MAIL

00:27:23.141 --> 00:27:26.269
DON'T SET YOURSELF AFLAME

00:27:54.714 --> 00:27:55.715
Thank you, sir.

00:28:12.941 --> 00:28:14.442
He went over the fence?

00:28:16.778 --> 00:28:18.697
Yes, he is our cinematographer.

00:28:21.366 --> 00:28:22.200
Of course.

00:28:22.283 --> 00:28:24.369
We'll send someone over right away.

00:28:27.872 --> 00:28:29.374
He sure makes it hard to like him.

00:28:29.457 --> 00:28:30.458
What is it?

00:28:31.209 --> 00:28:32.043
It's nothing.

00:28:39.050 --> 00:28:40.677
Due to scheduling conflicts,

00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:43.596
the scenes
in the secret underground storage--

00:28:44.431 --> 00:28:45.515
Excuse me.

00:28:48.017 --> 00:28:49.018
Hello?

00:28:51.730 --> 00:28:53.148
Our cinematographer?

00:28:54.983 --> 00:28:56.025
Yes.

00:28:57.444 --> 00:28:58.695
I'll head over now.

00:28:59.946 --> 00:29:01.865
Why? What happened?

00:29:11.207 --> 00:29:13.334
PRODUCTION VEHICLE

00:29:21.718 --> 00:29:23.094
I'm so sorry.

00:29:23.178 --> 00:29:24.804
He is our cinematographer,

00:29:24.888 --> 00:29:27.140
who seems to have thought
the doors were unlocked.

00:29:27.724 --> 00:29:28.808
Here's our permit.

00:29:30.018 --> 00:29:31.144
My apologies.

00:29:33.605 --> 00:29:34.522
Yes, all clear.

00:29:35.398 --> 00:29:36.983
Please don’t let this happen again.

00:29:37.066 --> 00:29:38.151
Yes, I'm sorry.

00:29:38.818 --> 00:29:41.780
If you wanted to come here,
you should have told someone.

00:29:41.863 --> 00:29:43.406
How come you came?

00:29:44.532 --> 00:29:48.703
I'm the only one with a Class A license
to drive that vehicle.

00:29:49.287 --> 00:29:50.663
You have a Class A license?

00:29:51.581 --> 00:29:53.333
I didn't even know you could drive.

00:29:53.875 --> 00:29:56.211
I drive well. I just rarely do.

00:29:58.463 --> 00:30:00.507
What is it you wanted to check?

00:30:00.590 --> 00:30:03.384
Just the route from here
to the third floor.

00:30:11.893 --> 00:30:13.144
You'll catch a cold.

00:30:14.187 --> 00:30:15.730
Wear this. It's chilly.

00:30:17.690 --> 00:30:18.733
I'm good.

00:30:20.777 --> 00:30:21.820
Fine, then.

00:30:44.551 --> 00:30:45.844
I couldn't get rid of it.

00:30:47.011 --> 00:30:49.389
Why would you need to? It was expensive.

00:30:50.390 --> 00:30:53.059
I didn't get rid of the monopod
you gave me either.

00:30:57.105 --> 00:30:58.356
Do you want to take a look?

00:30:59.941 --> 00:31:00.775
Sure.

00:31:03.111 --> 00:31:04.487
Do you even know how?

00:31:05.697 --> 00:31:06.906
Just focus on your work.

00:32:22.273 --> 00:32:24.484
You should've gotten a Class A license.

00:32:25.944 --> 00:32:26.945
What a shame.

00:32:27.028 --> 00:32:29.197
You could have had
some alone time with him.

00:32:30.949 --> 00:32:32.909
Did they really have
that strong of a bond?

00:32:33.409 --> 00:32:36.329
Why are you so invested
in someone else's personal life?

00:32:36.412 --> 00:32:38.581
I'm just amused by you.

00:32:38.665 --> 00:32:41.501
It's funny how one guy makes you think
you've never beaten her.

00:32:41.584 --> 00:32:44.170
Did you bring slippers?
Your sneakers must be soaked.

00:32:44.253 --> 00:32:45.797
That guy's not for you.

00:32:46.297 --> 00:32:49.133
He only has eyes for Producer Ryu.
And they look good together.

00:32:50.051 --> 00:32:51.260
Please keep out of it.

00:32:51.344 --> 00:32:52.470
It's just ironic.

00:32:52.971 --> 00:32:54.847
Tons of guys are interested in you,

00:32:54.931 --> 00:32:57.266
yet you’re stuck on a guy
who doesn't even suit you.

00:32:57.934 --> 00:33:00.186
Director Kim is an open book.
Too predictable.

00:33:00.269 --> 00:33:02.230
I like predictable people.

00:33:02.981 --> 00:33:04.607
But they're no fun.

00:33:05.108 --> 00:33:08.069
The ones who are harder to read,
like you, are the fun ones.

00:33:08.778 --> 00:33:10.530
Should I buy you new shoes?

00:33:11.906 --> 00:33:15.076
If you really can't get over him,
tell him how you feel.

00:33:15.159 --> 00:33:16.494
And do it properly this time.

00:33:20.915 --> 00:33:24.335
Why is someone as bold as you
struggling to tell him how you feel?

00:33:24.919 --> 00:33:27.171
Dating at 20 is no big deal.

00:33:27.255 --> 00:33:29.340
I doubt their bond was that amazing.

00:33:38.516 --> 00:33:40.518
-No one is here yet.
-Seems so.

00:33:41.561 --> 00:33:43.146
How come you're here?

00:33:43.646 --> 00:33:45.732
Didn't you go to fetch Director Kim?

00:33:51.487 --> 00:33:52.488
Hey, Yu-chan.

00:33:52.572 --> 00:33:54.866
Why aren't you back with the car yet?

00:33:55.575 --> 00:33:57.368
Why are you snapping at me?

00:34:05.376 --> 00:34:06.294
Oh dear.

00:34:08.254 --> 00:34:10.423
Oh my goodness.

00:34:11.215 --> 00:34:13.176
Ma'am, are you okay?

00:34:14.552 --> 00:34:15.470
Are you okay?

00:34:15.553 --> 00:34:17.597
My goodness, thank you.

00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:19.432
-Thank you.
-I'll help you with this.

00:34:19.515 --> 00:34:20.641
I'll be right back.

00:34:22.852 --> 00:34:23.728
Goodness.

00:34:23.811 --> 00:34:25.271
-Are you hurt, ma'am?
-I'm fine.

00:34:25.354 --> 00:34:28.691
You don't have to wipe that.
You'll ruin your clothes.

00:34:28.775 --> 00:34:29.817
I can get this washed.

00:34:29.901 --> 00:34:31.652
Goodness, no, but still…

00:34:31.736 --> 00:34:33.821
-It's quite all right.
-You can stop now.

00:34:36.491 --> 00:34:37.784
Is she your wife?

00:34:40.078 --> 00:34:40.912
No, ma'am.

00:34:40.995 --> 00:34:43.164
Your wife is a pretty little thing.

00:34:43.247 --> 00:34:44.373
Very pretty indeed.

00:34:44.457 --> 00:34:45.833
It's not like that.

00:34:45.917 --> 00:34:46.918
How pretty.

00:34:48.044 --> 00:34:49.003
Just use these.

00:35:02.350 --> 00:35:03.351
Wipe up.

00:35:04.852 --> 00:35:06.229
You're looking so pretty.

00:35:07.855 --> 00:35:09.190
Wipe yourself.

00:35:09.690 --> 00:35:11.484
There's some here.

00:35:16.656 --> 00:35:19.450
I'm good. You worry about yourself.

00:35:28.751 --> 00:35:31.629
-Wow, this is spacious.
-The rust looks great.

00:35:32.296 --> 00:35:34.257
This spot here is interesting.

00:35:34.340 --> 00:35:35.675
That's good.

00:35:37.093 --> 00:35:38.761
This space and that area…

00:35:38.845 --> 00:35:42.014
We should see how much
set dressing we can do here.

00:35:42.890 --> 00:35:45.309
The doors and roof might be…

00:35:51.482 --> 00:35:52.358
It's this way.

00:36:00.366 --> 00:36:01.701
Good work today, everyone.

00:36:02.535 --> 00:36:05.371
Where is Producer Ryu?
Is she feeling unwell?

00:36:07.081 --> 00:36:08.499
She didn't seem ill.

00:36:08.583 --> 00:36:11.127
Then tell her to come.
You can't miss seafood in Sokcho.

00:36:11.210 --> 00:36:13.379
-Okay.
-Producer Song already went to get her.

00:36:13.462 --> 00:36:14.964
He did? Okay, then.

00:36:17.758 --> 00:36:18.759
Why are you alone?

00:36:18.843 --> 00:36:20.428
She doesn't have an appetite.

00:36:22.221 --> 00:36:23.681
No appetite?

00:36:24.265 --> 00:36:26.392
How can anyone pass up these delicacies?

00:36:33.482 --> 00:36:34.775
Have you been drinking?

00:36:46.913 --> 00:36:49.373
I was worried
you might have caught my cold.

00:36:51.459 --> 00:36:53.878
I told Yu-chan that I wasn't ill.

00:36:57.506 --> 00:36:58.466
I'll have one too.

00:37:00.885 --> 00:37:03.304
Are you sure you should drink while sick?

00:37:04.764 --> 00:37:05.723
Don't you know?

00:37:06.891 --> 00:37:08.226
Alcohol works like a cure.

00:37:19.946 --> 00:37:21.489
How's your mom?

00:37:32.041 --> 00:37:33.459
Every so often…

00:37:36.754 --> 00:37:38.214
I think about her.

00:37:45.763 --> 00:37:47.098
What are you staring at?

00:37:49.308 --> 00:37:50.977
I know how to be grateful.

00:37:57.400 --> 00:37:59.318
Mom often mentions you too.

00:38:01.529 --> 00:38:03.030
I have to admit, it bugs me.

00:38:07.243 --> 00:38:09.078
I'm craving hand-torn noodles.

00:38:13.249 --> 00:38:14.583
Maybe it's the rain,

00:38:15.751 --> 00:38:18.629
but I'm craving her hand-torn noodles.

00:38:21.132 --> 00:38:24.635
Go have some, then. She'd be pleased
to see you, even without me.

00:38:24.719 --> 00:38:26.429
You want me to visit her alone?

00:38:27.930 --> 00:38:29.181
Would that be weird?

00:38:29.974 --> 00:38:32.435
Or we could go on one of our days off.

00:38:50.286 --> 00:38:51.912
Do you visit Ms. Yoon…

00:38:54.123 --> 00:38:55.124
every so often?

00:39:00.504 --> 00:39:01.422
No.

00:39:02.298 --> 00:39:03.674
I haven't been once.

00:39:12.933 --> 00:39:14.352
I hate the ocean.

00:39:17.938 --> 00:39:18.939
But

00:39:20.149 --> 00:39:21.359
I do like raw fish.

00:39:29.158 --> 00:39:31.452
Did something happen earlier with seonbae?

00:39:34.413 --> 00:39:35.289
Nothing happened.

00:39:36.957 --> 00:39:39.126
It was pretty obvious,
as if you two argued.

00:39:41.087 --> 00:39:42.546
It's just annoying

00:39:42.630 --> 00:39:45.716
that I had to go all the way there
in the rain because of him.

00:39:46.675 --> 00:39:47.927
Is that really it?

00:39:51.972 --> 00:39:53.682
What more do you expect?

00:39:57.937 --> 00:40:00.398
If there's nothing more,
then quit behaving like this.

00:40:02.525 --> 00:40:04.235
Do you have to make it so obvious

00:40:05.569 --> 00:40:07.446
that it’s awkward between you two?

00:40:15.204 --> 00:40:16.914
What do you mean "obvious"?

00:40:19.083 --> 00:40:21.210
You're the only one who has noticed.

00:40:23.796 --> 00:40:26.632
It's perfectly normal
to skip dinner after work.

00:40:26.715 --> 00:40:28.384
Do I deserve to be judged for that?

00:40:28.467 --> 00:40:30.344
Showing up for drinks is part of the job.

00:40:31.804 --> 00:40:35.224
How can you be an executive producer
if you can't even control your emotions?

00:40:41.814 --> 00:40:42.982
DO NOT ANSWER

00:40:48.154 --> 00:40:51.449
Stop drinking and join us.
You're making people worried.

00:41:24.273 --> 00:41:26.859
The lady of the hour is finally here!

00:41:29.403 --> 00:41:31.947
Yay! Awesome Eun-jung's here!

00:41:32.698 --> 00:41:33.657
Sorry I'm late.

00:41:33.741 --> 00:41:36.202
Since you're the last one here,
you get three shots.

00:41:38.329 --> 00:41:39.914
Yes, of course.

00:41:39.997 --> 00:41:40.956
Okay.

00:41:41.749 --> 00:41:43.459
That's right, Ryu Eun-jung!

00:41:43.542 --> 00:41:45.252
You're the best!

00:41:47.296 --> 00:41:51.467
Now that we're all here,
what do we say to truth or dare?

00:41:52.927 --> 00:41:54.303
I'm in!

00:41:54.386 --> 00:41:56.096
There he goes again.

00:41:56.180 --> 00:41:57.765
Fine, but no crap questions

00:41:57.848 --> 00:42:01.519
like, "When was your last kiss?"
or, "When did you last have sex?"

00:42:01.602 --> 00:42:02.520
Sure!

00:42:02.603 --> 00:42:04.271
Why don't you start us off, then?

00:42:05.356 --> 00:42:06.774
-I'm down.
-Okay.

00:42:06.857 --> 00:42:09.985
I'll make this your last game
of truth or dare, Director Gyeong.

00:42:10.069 --> 00:42:11.487
Oh, she's scary.

00:42:11.570 --> 00:42:12.488
So intense.

00:42:15.032 --> 00:42:15.991
Okay, Director.

00:42:16.492 --> 00:42:17.326
Go on.

00:42:19.078 --> 00:42:20.788
Are you dating Producer Cheon?

00:42:28.337 --> 00:42:29.588
So you're out for blood.

00:42:32.841 --> 00:42:35.135
Why did you drink?
You should say it's not true--

00:42:35.219 --> 00:42:36.178
Cheon Sang-yeon.

00:42:36.762 --> 00:42:38.389
You like someone here, don't you?

00:42:52.486 --> 00:42:53.737
Director Kim.

00:42:56.574 --> 00:42:58.826
Would you say yes if I asked you out?

00:43:02.580 --> 00:43:03.414
What the…

00:43:04.290 --> 00:43:06.542
-What is this?
-What was that?

00:43:06.625 --> 00:43:07.459
No.

00:43:10.546 --> 00:43:12.673
What a shame. You're exactly my type.

00:43:13.966 --> 00:43:14.800
Producer Song.

00:43:16.302 --> 00:43:19.597
Do you think the person you like
will reciprocate your feelings?

00:43:20.472 --> 00:43:21.682
Do you like someone?

00:43:21.765 --> 00:43:23.309
Of course she would.

00:43:23.392 --> 00:43:25.394
I have absolutely no doubt about it.

00:43:27.730 --> 00:43:31.108
Man, I'm starting to like this game!

00:43:32.484 --> 00:43:33.485
Ryu Eun-jung.

00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:36.030
Is your 100 here right now?

00:43:36.572 --> 00:43:38.824
100? What's that?

00:43:39.325 --> 00:43:41.910
Come on, you can't speak in code.

00:43:41.994 --> 00:43:43.245
No.

00:43:43.329 --> 00:43:45.539
That tells us nothing
unless we know what it is.

00:43:45.623 --> 00:43:46.707
Nope, not in here.

00:43:48.626 --> 00:43:51.086
-Whatever it is, it's not here.
-It isn't here.

00:44:19.031 --> 00:44:19.865
It's true.

00:44:22.910 --> 00:44:24.578
Song Yu-chan gets on my nerves.

00:44:28.290 --> 00:44:29.541
But I am trying.

00:44:34.129 --> 00:44:35.005
Trying what?

00:44:37.132 --> 00:44:38.550
To avoid looking your way.

00:44:45.182 --> 00:44:46.767
But my eyes keep seeking you out.

00:44:52.439 --> 00:44:53.774
I'm falling for you again.

00:45:23.762 --> 00:45:25.222
But my eyes keep seeking you out.

00:45:26.390 --> 00:45:27.725
I'm falling for you again.

00:45:52.124 --> 00:45:54.376
I heard what he said to you.

00:45:59.381 --> 00:46:00.632
Mind your own business.

00:46:01.175 --> 00:46:03.844
I'm not looking to rekindle
anything with him.

00:46:06.638 --> 00:46:09.224
Are you sure
you're done with him for good?

00:46:13.812 --> 00:46:14.938
Is this truth or dare?

00:46:15.022 --> 00:46:17.149
So you'd be fine with me liking him?

00:46:20.194 --> 00:46:22.321
Sure, if that's what you want to do.

00:46:22.404 --> 00:46:24.323
Then do me a favor and back off.

00:46:26.283 --> 00:46:27.993
-What?
-I said back off.

00:46:29.495 --> 00:46:31.789
And stop leading people on.

00:50:08.630 --> 00:50:13.635
