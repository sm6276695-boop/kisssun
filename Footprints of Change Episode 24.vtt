[Episode 24]

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.539
You've been working hard lately.

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:49.550
This is your commission.

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:51.039
10,000 yuan.

00:01:57.759 --> 00:01:59.560
I can't take this money from you.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.790
I still owe you 60,000.

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.540
Besides, didn't you say yourself

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.480
that you lost money on the jeans deal?

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:09.330
I did lose money.

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:11.800
I gave Lu 120,000.

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.910
When Ye Xining
replaced the batch of jeans,

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:15.170
I paid another 60,000.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.610
But losses are the boss's problem,

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.120
not the employee's concern.

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.120
I'm now

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:21.600
trying to follow

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:22.910
international

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:24.560
big company

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.710
standards in how I operate.

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.079
And you just said

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:32.210
you owe me 60,000.

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.700
Right, with this 10,000,
that makes 70,000.

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:36.680
So to you,

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:38.370
you're only worth 70,000?

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.760
As long as we two brothers stick together,

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:42.430
I believe 700,000,

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:44.560
or even 7 million

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.420
is possible in the future.

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.030
Look how good things are now.

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:50.510
Business is booming.

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.010
Can't you feel it?

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:53.579
I can even smell it.

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.790
And I've recently realized something.

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:00.370
In business,

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:02.590
you need to be

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:04.870
a kind small-timer

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:07.570
or a ruthless big shot.

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:08.790
Get it?

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:15.640
Let me be honest with you.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.400
From what I've observed,

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:20.540
right now you're
just a ruthless small-timer.

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.380
No, you are!

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:26.400
Enough.

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:27.470
I'll go now.

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:28.510
Get some rest.

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.000
Hope you become
a kind big shot soon.

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:37.750
I can't do that.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.360
Hope I'm not disturbing you.

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:08.000
Not at all.

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:09.480
I'm doing aerobics.

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:11.690
Just working on my legs.

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.240
Didn't you say before

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:15.560
that you pawned your grandma's watch

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:16.950
to pay back Huang Yahui?

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:20.000
Here's 10,000 yuan.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.829
Take it first.

00:04:21.149 --> 00:04:23.150
Redeem it as soon as you save enough.

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.040
Where did you get this money?

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.900
Don't you still owe Yan Jun money?

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.340
This is the commission Yan Jun gave me.

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:33.750
Why are you grinning like that?

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:34.600
Take it.

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:35.750
I don't need it.

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:37.680
I've already redeemed that watch.

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:38.800
Keep it for yourself.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.730
Just make me
some extra noodles in the future,

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:42.010
with more meat,

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:43.570
and some vegetables I like.

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:44.510
Okay.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.130
I'll leave you then.

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:47.409
Wait a moment.

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:57.780
Thank you.

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:00.900
They're all dry.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.660
I hung them up to dry
and folded them afterwards.

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.970
Then I'll add an egg
to your noodles next time.

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:07.410
Deal.

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:09.600
Come do laundry more often.

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:10.310
Sure.

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:11.600
I'll be going now.

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:12.260
No problem.

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:16.220
Did my exercise disturb you?

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:17.020
No, not at all.

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:17.930
Keep going.

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:21.070
Good night.

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:21.770
Bye.

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.560
Bye.

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:27.680
These raw denim jeans

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.200
are all made
from the best imported fabric.

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:34.190
They've all been ruined by the rain.

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:36.360
It's heartbreaking.

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:37.680
Why don't we

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:39.810
donate them to charity?

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:43.840
Right.

00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:45.409
Those kids in the mountains,

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:47.070
if each of them wears one of these,

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:48.670
it would look quite strange.

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:52.640
I have an idea.

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:54.190
Let's do this.

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.750
Let's dry these jeans.

00:05:57.159 --> 00:05:58.390
Then sell them.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.680
I've noticed those young people

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:02.160
at the dance hall downstairs all wear

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:03.560
those light-colored jeans

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:05.220
with all those rips and tears.

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:07.000
So let's sell to them.

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:08.690
We can give these jeans

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:10.710
a complete redesign.

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:11.870
Mr. Lu,

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:12.890
do you know

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:15.360
any experts in stone washing
and acid washing?

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:16.750
We could consult with them

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:18.950
about the washing process techniques.

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:20.190
No problem.

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:21.240
They're all old friends.

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:21.990
I'll take care of it.

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:22.840
That's great.

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:25.100
But the three of us aren't enough.

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:26.800
Jiuling, quickly notify the workers

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:27.600
to get ready for work.

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:29.560
Prepare sandpaper and files.

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:30.870
Then I'll go find

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:33.000
some washed denim styles for reference.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.460
You're really something.

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:36.000
Wasn't this my idea?

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.750
I just said I had an idea.

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:39.870
Aren't we saying the same thing?

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:41.720
How did it suddenly
become your achievement?

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:42.890
Why are you taking credit?

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:44.550
Who's taking credit from you?

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:45.360
Mr. Lu,

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:46.190
tell me,

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:47.040
whose idea was this?

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:48.690
Wasn't I the one who suggested it?

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:49.750
Did you suggest it?

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:51.350
I didn't hear that.

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:53.390
I was listening to Ye the whole time.

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:54.310
Ye,

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:57.390
please explain your idea in more detail.

00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:58.830
What I meant was

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:01.190
we could redesign their style.

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:03.450
For example, some could be straight-leg,

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:05.590
and others could be tapered.

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:07.280
You two are really something.

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:09.870
I'm only here
because the factory is in trouble.

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:10.800
If the factory improves even a little,

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:12.310
I won't bother with you two anymore.

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:13.000
I'll leave immediately.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.590
Even if you beg me, I won't come back.

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:15.660
Who acts like this?

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:21.600
Come on, try on these clothes for me.

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:23.020
What is it?

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:27.040
Dunhill?

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:29.140
So you know about Dunhill?

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:31.200
This coat is quite expensive, right?

00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:33.390
Don't worry about the price.

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:35.680
I'm curious how you know about Dunhill.

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:38.600
I don't just know Dunhill.

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:40.110
I also know Montagut.

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:42.430
As a university teacher,
I can't afford it,

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:45.030
but I've seen
students' parents wearing them.

00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:46.090
Alright, enough talk.

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:46.950
Try it on for me.

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:49.000
Bro.

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:51.159
Look at where I live.

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:53.159
There's even a dog cage next to me.

00:07:53.159 --> 00:07:54.360
If I wear Dunhill,

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:56.360
it doesn't match this environment.

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:59.360
These clothes aren't for you
to wear in this room.

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:01.270
They're for when you
come with me to meet clients

00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:03.160
or when we go to the dog kennel.

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:04.950
What's the difference?

00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:06.280
The difference is huge.

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:07.480
The same dog,

00:08:07.890 --> 00:08:09.600
if you wear your current clothes,

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:10.680
is worth 5,000.

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:12.800
But if you wear Dunhill,

00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:14.660
the dog is worth 15,000.

00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:17.630
Stop talking and put it on.

00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:19.290
Come with me to the dog kennel.

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:22.240
So,

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:24.040
they say you were raised by dogs.

00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:28.040
So we're going to see
your real father now?

00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:29.990
You're right.

00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:31.320
I was raised by dogs.

00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:33.789
But you're raised by me.

00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:36.090
We're going to see your grandfather.

00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:37.510
Hurry up and change.
Come with me to the kennel.

00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:38.240
No more talk.

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:50.390
This color is really tacky.

00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:52.870
How can the most popular style be tacky?

00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:53.680
Do you even know how much it costs,

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:54.840
and you call it tacky?

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:56.570
You're such a country bumpkin.

00:08:56.790 --> 00:08:58.550
Once you put it on,
your value instantly changes.

00:08:58.550 --> 00:08:59.510
In Shanghai nowadays,

00:08:59.510 --> 00:09:01.220
who dares to wear this
without 100,000 in savings?

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:01.950
That'd be me.

00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:04.180
After you put it on,

00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:06.330
hurry up and earn back
the money for this suit.

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:07.450
I'm serious.

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:09.890
Say "welcome" to me. Let me hear it.

00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:11.770
Welcome to hell.

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:14.030
Lead the way.

00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:15.750
Let's go.

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:45.750
Good.

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:46.870
Very good.

00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:48.460
Ye,

00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:50.700
you've really come up with a great idea.

00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:53.430
This is what we call
turning trash into treasure.

00:09:53.890 --> 00:09:54.770
This idea

00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:55.990
isn't just mine.

00:09:56.030 --> 00:09:57.960
Jiuling deserves some credit too.

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:01.030
You

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:03.030
did alright.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:04.720
Miss Ye,

00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:06.150
please continue.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.000
The current situation is

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.720
that the factory can no longer afford

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:12.630
the shelf rental fees
for these jeans in department stores.

00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:13.790
So our next step

00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:16.400
is to figure out
how to open up sales channels.

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:19.250
I know some dealers.

00:10:19.570 --> 00:10:20.770
I'll give them a call.

00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:22.240
They should have channels

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:24.370
to help us sell off this batch quickly.

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:29.960
I have another idea.

00:10:31.270 --> 00:10:32.800
Let's set up a street stall.

00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:35.200
I used to sell things
at street stalls all the time,

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:37.060
so I'm familiar with how it works.

00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:40.000
We can sell at the Qipu Road Market.

00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:42.060
There are lots of young people there,

00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:43.390
so it'll be easier to sell our products.

00:10:43.390 --> 00:10:44.080
Miss Ye,

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:46.680
you've come up with another great idea.

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:48.030
Oh my!

00:10:49.890 --> 00:10:50.690
What was that?

00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:53.800
You don't think Miss Ye's idea is good?

00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:56.090
I shouldn't even bother with you two.

00:10:56.090 --> 00:10:58.240
I shouldn't be giving you advice at all.

00:10:58.240 --> 00:10:59.390
I talk too much.

00:10:59.390 --> 00:11:01.320
I'll just watch your factory fail.

00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:05.040
Jiuling,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.200
don't be upset.

00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:09.350
I know you've been working hard.

00:11:09.550 --> 00:11:10.790
All these ideas

00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:12.790
came from you too, right?

00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:15.810
So tell me,

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:17.240
at Qipu Road,

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.430
what are the advantages
of setting up a stall there?

00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:20.750
Setting up a stall at Qipu Road

00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:22.360
has one major advantage:

00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:24.180
there are many schools in that area,

00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:26.310
and many schools means many students.

00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:27.550
So this way, the whole...

00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:28.080
Oh right.

00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:30.440
I need to quickly call
some of my dealer friends.

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:31.700
You two keep chatting.

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:35.200
Later the teachers and students
will all come to buy.

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:37.030
It will form a stable customer base.

00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:37.390
And also,

00:11:37.390 --> 00:11:39.790
that area is already
a well-established market.

00:11:39.790 --> 00:11:41.920
We'll pick the most central location.

00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:42.670
We'll just put these...

00:11:42.670 --> 00:11:43.080
Jiuling.

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:44.750
I left my cup in the office.

00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:46.280
I'm going to get some water.

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:47.510
We'll just put all these things

00:11:47.510 --> 00:11:48.360
on display

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:49.440
and start promoting.

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:50.150
All these young people

00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:51.270
will come flocking in.

00:11:51.270 --> 00:11:52.670
We'll give them a discount then.

00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:53.550
Students will bring each other,

00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:54.150
one after another.

00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:56.010
They'll just keep coming, right?

00:11:56.030 --> 00:11:56.870
This Qipu Road Market

00:11:56.870 --> 00:11:58.510
is definitely our best

00:11:58.510 --> 00:12:00.110
place for setting up a stall.

00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:04.040
Sales there are definitely
not less than in shopping malls.

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:18.630
These clothes are good.

00:12:18.630 --> 00:12:19.320
The jeans are decent.

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:20.920
These jeans are pretty good.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:22.080
They look quite trendy.

00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:23.140
Want to take a look?

00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:24.150
How much are they?

00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:25.320
90 yuan each.

00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:28.690
They're high-waisted
and make you look slimmer.

00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:30.420
Give us a discount, Miss.

00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:31.350
We're students.

00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:34.400
85. I'll sell them to you for 85.

00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:35.850
85.

00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:36.960
How about 70?

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:38.630
I can't sell them for 70.

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:41.810
Take a good look. The fabric is excellent.

00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:43.880
It's still too expensive.

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:49.260
Aren't they

00:12:49.390 --> 00:12:51.190
the same as the ones I'm wearing?

00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:52.740
Aren't they?

00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:53.910
They're all distressed style.

00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:55.000
Let me check the material.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.270
This is quite soft

00:12:56.270 --> 00:12:56.720
and stretchy.

00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:58.250
These are exactly the same!

00:12:58.480 --> 00:12:59.510
Miss, how much are these?

00:12:59.510 --> 00:13:00.440
Mine are 90.

00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:01.200
How much?

00:13:01.270 --> 00:13:02.000
90.

00:13:03.630 --> 00:13:04.600
That's so cheap!

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:06.440
I bought mine at the mall for 180.

00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:08.600
Ma'am, you paid too much.

00:13:08.890 --> 00:13:10.090
When did you buy them?

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:11.200
About a week ago.

00:13:11.510 --> 00:13:12.240
If you'd bought them yesterday,

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:13.440
you could still return them.

00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:14.440
Don't worry.

00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:15.150
I'll tell you what,

00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:16.200
I'm going to return mine right now.

00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:17.000
Don't worry about it.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.320
And save me a size 3 of these jeans.

00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:19.910
For 90, right?

00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:20.240
Sure thing!

00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:21.550
Don't sell them to anyone else.

00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:22.670
This is such a bargain!

00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:23.930
I'll save them for you.

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:24.550
Miss.

00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:26.220
Sis.

00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:27.760
Will you still sell them for 85?

00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:28.760
Yes, 85.

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:30.740
Then I'll take one.

00:13:30.770 --> 00:13:31.570
I'll take one.

00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:32.600
If you like how it fits,

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:33.870
recommend it to your classmates

00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:35.360
and bring them here to shop.

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:35.870
Alright, Sis.

00:13:35.870 --> 00:13:37.500
I'll give you all a price of 85.

00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:38.360
Thank you, Sis.

00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:39.030
Here's your change.

00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:39.760
Your change.

00:13:42.390 --> 00:13:43.450
Welcome to come by.

00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:45.450
Introduce us to your classmates.

00:13:54.010 --> 00:13:54.940
Why are you back?

00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:56.150
Why wouldn't I come back?

00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:57.200
I'm so thirsty.

00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:58.200
You're comfortable standing here,

00:13:58.200 --> 00:13:59.510
protected from wind and rain.

00:13:59.510 --> 00:14:00.360
While I'm out in the blazing sun,

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:02.290
running back and forth like crazy.

00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:05.440
Customers're coming.

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:06.670
How much are these jeans, Miss?

00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:07.270
90.

00:14:07.870 --> 00:14:09.270
I just bought these jeans.

00:14:09.270 --> 00:14:10.870
I just got them from her shop.
Look, I'm wearing them.

00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:12.080
Look at the elasticity.

00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:12.670
It's perfect.

00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:14.390
Wear these to the disco.

00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:15.320
You'll look great.

00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:16.230
If you both buy,

00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:17.550
I'll charge 85 each.

00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:19.600
How much? But I paid 90 for mine.

00:14:19.910 --> 00:14:21.000
It's for two people buying together.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:21.790
Okay, okay.

00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:24.410
Next time you have to
sell to me for 85 too.

00:14:28.390 --> 00:14:29.790
How many times have you counted it?

00:14:29.790 --> 00:14:31.550
You're going to wear out the money.

00:14:31.550 --> 00:14:32.880
Mind your own business.

00:14:33.210 --> 00:14:34.880
I'll count my money
until my hands cramp up.

00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:35.850
I'm happy. I want to.

00:14:35.850 --> 00:14:36.720
I'm satisfied. I'm pleased.

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:38.980
I earned this money.
You have no say in it.

00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:40.010
I've lost track of how much is here.

00:14:40.010 --> 00:14:42.270
Look what you've done. You're annoying.

00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:45.660
Go answer the door.

00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:52.630
Who is it?

00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:56.030
My father told me to tell Jiang Jiuling

00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:57.230
that she has no shame.

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:22.170
Who was that?

00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:26.160
That person said you had no shame.

00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:32.910
Careful.

00:15:37.510 --> 00:15:38.300
Miss Ye.

00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:40.670
You've been working hard lately.

00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:41.080
Not at all.

00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:42.010
Let me toast you.

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:49.390
Recently,

00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:51.720
I found a dealer from Beijing

00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:53.080
named Yu Dacheng.

00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:54.000
He has agreed

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:55.860
to take a large batch of our goods.

00:15:58.840 --> 00:15:59.790
The unit price

00:15:59.790 --> 00:16:01.390
is 65 per piece.

00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:03.510
Is that acceptable to you?

00:16:03.510 --> 00:16:05.300
That's too harsh. 65?

00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:07.880
It's basically giving them our cost price.

00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:09.240
Yes.

00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:13.270
Then I'll talk to him again

00:16:13.270 --> 00:16:14.630
to see if we can get 70.

00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:16.630
Mr. Lu.

00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:19.030
You don't need to
negotiate with him anymore.

00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:21.080
Today, Jiuling and I set up a stall

00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:23.080
and sold 50 pairs of jeans.

00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:25.440
And we sold them for 85 to 90

00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:26.220
per piece.

00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:27.860
50 pairs?

00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:34.240
We've decided to set up stalls

00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:35.820
at various universities,

00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:37.750
spending a week at each school

00:16:38.270 --> 00:16:41.030
to sell everything within a few weeks.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.270
Your skills are really impressive.

00:16:43.270 --> 00:16:44.530
Let me toast you again.

00:16:47.550 --> 00:16:48.840
On behalf of the company

00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:49.960
and all of us,

00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:51.230
thank you.

00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:54.200
Thank you.

00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:56.670
I'll drink first to show my respect.

00:16:56.670 --> 00:16:57.870
Please drink slowly.

00:17:07.109 --> 00:17:07.819
Mr. Lu.

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:12.480
Jiuling is your relative,

00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:13.270
isn't she?

00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:15.579
She's my distant cousin.

00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:18.400
Miss Ye.

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:19.880
Mr... Mr. Yan?

00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:21.200
Mr. Lu, you're dining here too?

00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:21.800
Beichuan.

00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:23.640
Mr. Lu.

00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:24.920
May we join you?

00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:27.990
Mr. Yan has already sat down.

00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:29.450
Beichuan, have a seat too.

00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:32.000
I'll pay for the meal today.

00:17:32.550 --> 00:17:33.200
No need.

00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:34.240
I'll pay.

00:17:34.650 --> 00:17:35.520
Let me pay.

00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:36.810
I insist on paying.

00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:37.940
Then let Mr. Lu pay.

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:39.400
Let's thank Mr. Lu.

00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:41.310
Thank you, Mr. Lu.

00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:42.310
Don't mention it.

00:17:42.550 --> 00:17:43.160
Beichuan.

00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:44.270
Today

00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:45.510
I'm mainly treating

00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:46.640
Miss Ye.

00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:48.070
Miss Ye

00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:51.270
has made tremendous contributions
to our business.

00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:53.790
What impressive thing

00:17:53.790 --> 00:17:55.000
has Miss Ye done?

00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:57.400
Miss Ye sold

00:17:57.850 --> 00:18:00.090
50 pairs of jeans in just one day.

00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:03.590
Let me tell you, at 50 pairs a day,

00:18:03.790 --> 00:18:04.790
in less than 20 days

00:18:04.790 --> 00:18:06.920
our entire inventory will be cleared.

00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:09.550
Then my jeans

00:18:09.830 --> 00:18:11.960
will definitely rot in the warehouse.

00:18:12.790 --> 00:18:13.750
What should I do?

00:18:14.350 --> 00:18:16.480
I can't ask Miss Ye

00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:18.140
to help me sell my jeans, can I?

00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:20.030
Beichuan.

00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:22.450
Why don't you learn from Miss Ye?

00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:24.720
See if you can sell 50 pairs a day.

00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:26.790
You can't, can you?

00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:29.410
Mr. Lu.

00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:31.070
I really envy you.

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:32.180
Look,

00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:34.520
you have someone like Miss Ye

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.400
who is not only beautiful

00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:38.640
but also extremely capable.

00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:41.570
Look at our guy here.

00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:44.160
This one, when he's out there,

00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:46.550
has extremely low emotional intelligence.

00:18:46.550 --> 00:18:48.440
He's terrible at dealing with people.

00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:49.780
Every matter he handles,

00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:51.780
I end up having to clean up after him.

00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:53.170
And internally,

00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:55.720
those dog names I asked you to memorize,

00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:57.120
have you learnt them all?

00:18:57.440 --> 00:19:00.100
You definitely
haven't memorized them either.

00:19:01.570 --> 00:19:02.200
Mr. Lu.

00:19:02.790 --> 00:19:03.650
How about this?

00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:06.690
Let Miss Ye work for me for a while.

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:09.750
Beichuan, why don't you
go work for Mr. Lu for a while?

00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:10.680
Would that work?

00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:11.960
No, that won't work.

00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:14.240
Mr. Yan.

00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:17.480
Beichuan is your classmate, right?

00:19:17.790 --> 00:19:18.830
Yes, he's my classmate.

00:19:18.830 --> 00:19:21.290
How can you talk
to your classmate like that?

00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:22.110
Beichuan.

00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:23.420
Your boss talks to you like this,

00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:24.420
aren't you upset?

00:19:24.790 --> 00:19:25.590
I'm not upset.

00:19:25.590 --> 00:19:26.310
See?

00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:29.550
Beichuan has such a good personality
and temper.

00:19:29.550 --> 00:19:30.700
You have such a good employee.

00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:32.030
You should be grateful.

00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:33.200
Come on, drink up!

00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:35.460
Well.

00:19:36.050 --> 00:19:37.140
I was just joking.

00:19:37.170 --> 00:19:38.480
Why are you taking it seriously?

00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:39.160
I'll drink.

00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:40.480
I'll drink, I'll drink.

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:41.080
Beichuan.

00:19:55.650 --> 00:20:01.250
[Fuxingzhai]

00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:05.270
Mr. Yan, we've arrived.

00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:08.200
Mr. Yan?

00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:11.270
Yan Jun.

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:15.760
Yan Jun, wake up.

00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:22.590
Miss Ye.

00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:25.790
Tonight

00:20:26.750 --> 00:20:28.750
I won't escort you back to your room.

00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:30.310
Are you drunk?

00:20:31.030 --> 00:20:32.890
Let Xiang Beichuan take you back.

00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:34.900
But

00:20:35.830 --> 00:20:37.440
you need to be careful.

00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:41.160
Xiang Beichuan is not a good person.

00:20:41.830 --> 00:20:44.070
He was expelled from school

00:20:44.610 --> 00:20:46.670
because he had inappropriate relationships

00:20:46.670 --> 00:20:48.590
with female students.

00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:51.680
He always crosses boundaries.

00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:55.820
He took female students into the woods.

00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:57.750
Stop talking nonsense, will you, bro?

00:20:57.750 --> 00:20:58.440
Shut up.

00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:00.070
Let him finish.

00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:00.980
Look,

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.040
he looks quite honest.

00:21:03.310 --> 00:21:04.510
That's what they call

00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:08.400
"Appearances are deceptive.

00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:11.160
A fair face may hide a foul heart."

00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:15.590
He's just a hypocrite.

00:21:16.110 --> 00:21:17.920
Our teacher, Mr. Zhong,

00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:20.920
even called me

00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:22.790
and asked me to mentor him.

00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:26.380
I don't even know how many
female students he's done this with.

00:21:27.390 --> 00:21:28.480
He is

00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:30.920
nothing but a black sheep

00:21:32.070 --> 00:21:33.670
of the teaching profession.

00:21:40.750 --> 00:21:41.550
Let's go.

00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:44.160
Quite impressive.

00:21:53.550 --> 00:21:55.280
Why is this light broken again?

00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:58.160
Miss Ye, be careful not to trip.

00:21:58.800 --> 00:21:59.880
Let me help you.

00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:00.960
Don't come near me.

00:22:01.150 --> 00:22:03.350
I'm afraid you'll take advantage of me.

00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:05.450
Why would I take advantage of you?

00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:07.510
From what Mr. Yan said today,

00:22:07.830 --> 00:22:08.760
staying with you

00:22:09.070 --> 00:22:10.180
in this darkness

00:22:10.270 --> 00:22:11.200
is dangerous.

00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:15.440
Why do you believe him instead of me?

00:22:15.790 --> 00:22:17.510
You can ask around at our school.

00:22:17.510 --> 00:22:19.000
I've been an outstanding
teacher every year.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:20.060
I won't ask around.

00:22:20.070 --> 00:22:21.870
I only believe what Yan Jun said.

00:22:23.030 --> 00:22:23.880
Then let me

00:22:24.550 --> 00:22:25.350
describe to you

00:22:25.350 --> 00:22:27.210
what actually happened that day.

00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:30.780
I was preparing lessons in my office.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.310
There was a very ordinary female student

00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:35.400
who brought her essay for my feedback.

00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:37.030
I even complimented her,

00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:39.310
but she ran out with her assignment

00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:40.650
crying as she went.

00:22:41.070 --> 00:22:42.130
Why was she crying?

00:22:42.590 --> 00:22:44.320
Did you put your arm around her?

00:22:44.370 --> 00:22:45.440
I didn't put my arm around her.

00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:46.310
You hugged her.

00:22:46.790 --> 00:22:48.110
How could I possibly hug her?

00:22:48.110 --> 00:22:48.920
Then you kissed her.

00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:50.720
I really didn't kiss her.

00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:53.440
She took her assignment
and walked out crying,

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:54.790
then told everyone at school

00:22:54.790 --> 00:22:55.830
that I harassed her.

00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:57.510
Who knows what you two did in that room?

00:22:57.510 --> 00:22:58.120
Well,

00:22:58.570 --> 00:22:59.290
the key point is

00:22:59.290 --> 00:23:01.200
there was nobody else
in the office at that time.

00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:02.260
Who are you people?

00:23:02.750 --> 00:23:04.030
What are you two arguing about

00:23:04.030 --> 00:23:05.440
in the middle of the night?

00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:07.750
Whether you're fighting
or talking about divorce,

00:23:07.750 --> 00:23:08.830
take it outside.

00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:09.920
Don't do it here.

00:23:09.940 --> 00:23:10.790
Sir, I'm sorry.

00:23:10.790 --> 00:23:11.550
We're trying to sleep.

00:23:11.550 --> 00:23:12.480
He's just like this.

00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:13.590
He talks very loudly

00:23:13.590 --> 00:23:15.680
and doesn't mind his behavior in public.

00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:16.510
I'm sorry, Sir.

00:23:16.510 --> 00:23:17.840
We disturbed your rest.

00:23:18.130 --> 00:23:18.940
Excuse me.

00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:22.720
Look.

00:23:23.070 --> 00:23:24.110
What were we just talking about

00:23:24.110 --> 00:23:26.110
that made him think we were married?

00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:28.000
This is exactly the same

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:29.680
as what happened to me before.

00:23:29.950 --> 00:23:31.880
I really couldn't explain myself.

00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:34.030
Yu Dacheng, that dealer,

00:23:34.030 --> 00:23:35.890
actually surprised me this time.

00:23:37.310 --> 00:23:39.040
His offer is quite reasonable.

00:23:39.350 --> 00:23:41.400
We'll sell him some jeans first

00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:42.950
to get some cash back.

00:23:43.790 --> 00:23:44.850
Then I'll find a way

00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:45.660
to get a loan.

00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:49.350
But...

00:23:49.750 --> 00:23:50.920
When dealing with

00:23:51.550 --> 00:23:51.960
Yu Dacheng,

00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:53.490
we still need to be careful.

00:23:56.830 --> 00:23:57.640
I'm sorry.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.130
Got stuck in traffic and arrived late.

00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:02.620
Ye.

00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:04.170
What's that smell?

00:24:06.220 --> 00:24:07.080
I didn't drink.

00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:08.200
Jiuling.

00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:10.330
Next time drink something
with higher alcohol content.

00:24:10.330 --> 00:24:11.460
When you drink low-proof alcohol,

00:24:11.460 --> 00:24:12.920
the smell lingers all day the next day.

00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:14.450
39 proof is considered low?

00:24:16.790 --> 00:24:18.850
What did you talk about this morning?

00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:21.590
Mr. Lu said he met
an old friend this morning.

00:24:21.590 --> 00:24:24.000
It was Mr. Chen from
Shanghai Silk Factory.

00:24:24.290 --> 00:24:26.310
They have a batch
of sand-washed silk fabrics,

00:24:26.310 --> 00:24:27.590
and we decided to buy all of them.

00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:28.350
Ye,

00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:29.500
don't tell her.

00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:31.590
That's what she gets for being late.

00:24:31.590 --> 00:24:32.810
Tell me about it.

00:24:33.510 --> 00:24:34.550
Ye, don't listen to him.

00:24:34.550 --> 00:24:36.920
Go on. So we're going to
buy them all, then what?

00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:38.520
How are we going to sell them?

00:24:42.870 --> 00:24:44.160
Fine, don't tell me then.

00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:46.070
But I have one principle:

00:24:46.510 --> 00:24:48.770
given our factory's current situation,

00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:51.350
we can't increase expenses anymore.

00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:52.550
We can only cut costs.

00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:56.330
I need to freshen up.

00:24:58.820 --> 00:25:00.150
I'm going to see Yan Jun.

00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:06.100
Hey, Dummy.

00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:07.110
Miss Ye.

00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:08.040
What's up?

00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:09.400
I'm here to see Yan Jun.

00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:10.930
I need to ask him something.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:12.660
Yan Jun went out for business.

00:25:13.190 --> 00:25:15.390
Is there anything I can tell him for you?

00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:16.640
Didn't you mention before

00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:19.000
that Yan Jun's company
and Ocean Department Store

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:20.200
had worked together?

00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:21.510
Ocean Department Store

00:25:21.510 --> 00:25:23.400
is having an anniversary celebration soon.

00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:24.030
Our factory

00:25:24.030 --> 00:25:25.400
is producing a batch of shirts.

00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:27.880
We want to promote our products there.

00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:30.070
Could he help us get in?

00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:31.660
I heard him mention it.

00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:33.750
He said the department store's
anniversary this year

00:25:33.750 --> 00:25:35.150
will be on a larger scale.

00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:36.340
They want to attract more businesses

00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:38.160
and lower the entry requirements.

00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:39.000
That's great!

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:41.110
We're interested and we'd be a good fit.

00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:43.000
Sure, I'll let him know.

00:25:43.020 --> 00:25:43.700
Great.

00:25:45.310 --> 00:25:46.640
What are you looking at?

00:25:48.750 --> 00:25:49.790
Smart pets?

00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:51.640
You made this, right?

00:25:52.550 --> 00:25:54.000
Not bad, Dummy.

00:25:54.750 --> 00:25:55.920
You did a good job.

00:25:59.070 --> 00:26:00.440
So many types of dogs.

00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:04.200
Let me tell you something.

00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:05.640
When you encounter something unpleasant

00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:06.830
or troubling,

00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:08.510
do you know what you should do?

00:26:08.510 --> 00:26:09.440
What should I do?

00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:11.440
Just talk to these dogs of yours.

00:26:12.030 --> 00:26:13.400
And they'll answer you.

00:26:24.270 --> 00:26:25.680
Miss Ye, are you hungry?

00:26:26.310 --> 00:26:27.590
We have imported dog food here.

00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:29.200
I could grab you a handful to snack on.

00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:30.790
Who are you calling a dog?

00:26:31.110 --> 00:26:32.470
No, that was just a joke.

00:26:34.690 --> 00:26:35.920
By the way,

00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:36.920
could you sometime

00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:38.450
give me a photo of yourself?

00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:40.440
What for?

00:26:41.790 --> 00:26:42.720
To print on this.

00:26:42.860 --> 00:26:43.700
You're still calling me a dog.

00:26:43.700 --> 00:26:45.060
That was also a joke.

00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:47.750
If you want to print me on this,

00:26:47.750 --> 00:26:49.440
you'll have to pay me.

00:26:50.140 --> 00:26:51.100
Deal.

00:26:51.570 --> 00:26:53.030
Put me behind this Bichon.

00:26:54.310 --> 00:26:55.440
Place my photo here?

00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:56.640
Is that appropriate?

00:26:58.200 --> 00:26:59.880
You're becoming naughty, Dummy.

00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:00.400
No, no.

00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:02.000
I just made two jokes.

00:27:04.590 --> 00:27:05.790
You're quite fierce.

00:27:08.090 --> 00:27:09.680
Do you have a favorite here?

00:27:10.970 --> 00:27:13.160
So far, it might be...

00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:15.480
Probably that big dog.

00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:18.680
Then I'll put my photo on that one.

00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:20.830
Sure, I'll save a spot for you.

00:27:22.650 --> 00:27:24.780
You're actually taking me seriously.

00:27:26.690 --> 00:27:27.970
Let me get you a soda.

00:27:36.070 --> 00:27:36.720
The following outfits

00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:36.980
[Ocean Department Store
1st Anniversary Fashion Show]

00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:39.790
are newly designed
spun-silk sand-washed shirts

00:27:39.790 --> 00:27:42.160
by Guoyao Garment Trading Company.

00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:44.160
The fabric uses the latest technology.

00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:46.510
Please enjoy the show. Let's welcome.

00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:30.340
Miss Ye.

00:28:31.030 --> 00:28:33.630
This is great!
Where did you find these models?

00:28:36.940 --> 00:28:38.000
Was this your idea?

00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:39.440
Of course.

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:41.400
Mr. Yan, I need to thank you

00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:43.440
for getting us
into Ocean Department Store.

00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:44.840
I can't let you lose face.

00:28:45.550 --> 00:28:47.010
This makes me look so good.

00:28:48.950 --> 00:28:49.590
Mr. Lu.

00:28:50.750 --> 00:28:52.950
This modeling team must cost a fortune.

00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:54.270
Nothing ventured,

00:28:54.270 --> 00:28:55.200
nothing gained.

00:28:55.750 --> 00:28:57.890
Look how well this turned out.

00:28:57.920 --> 00:28:59.590
Even if you venture, you still won't gain.

00:28:59.590 --> 00:29:01.450
You're just throwing money away.

00:29:03.310 --> 00:29:05.000
Stop running your mouth here.

00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:07.200
Our money has already been

00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:08.070
spent.

00:29:08.070 --> 00:29:09.310
Just wish everyone the best.

00:29:09.310 --> 00:29:11.050
When did I not wish everyone well?

00:29:11.050 --> 00:29:13.580
I'm just worried about
the company's losses.

00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:15.660
We had a meeting last time.

00:29:16.330 --> 00:29:17.880
The meeting already made a decision.

00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:19.480
We'll follow that decision.

00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:20.920
I'm not going against the decision.

00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:22.550
Aren't I sitting right here now?

00:29:22.550 --> 00:29:23.350
Then get out.

00:29:32.450 --> 00:29:33.250
Mr. Lu.

00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:35.820
Look at the first row on the right.

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:37.510
Two men in black suits.

00:29:37.590 --> 00:29:38.310
The one on the right

00:29:38.310 --> 00:29:40.350
is Mr. Sun, the manager
from the foreign trade agency.

00:29:40.350 --> 00:29:42.310
Next to him is a Hungarian businessman.

00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:43.400
After the show ends,

00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:44.590
let's talk to them.

00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:45.400
Okay.

00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:48.590
Miss Ye.

00:29:49.310 --> 00:29:50.790
We still believe in you.

00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:53.040
It's just this order...

00:29:54.030 --> 00:29:55.790
I'm still a bit anxious about it.

00:29:55.790 --> 00:29:57.040
Don't worry, Mr. Lu.

00:29:57.720 --> 00:29:58.850
I'll take care of it.

00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:06.590
Take it easy.

00:30:07.310 --> 00:30:08.160
Thank you, Ye.

00:30:09.910 --> 00:30:10.440
Let's go.

00:30:11.370 --> 00:30:12.300
Where is Mr. Yan?

00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:15.590
This is our company business.
Why should he be here?

00:30:15.590 --> 00:30:17.590
He's asking for the model's number.

00:30:18.770 --> 00:30:20.230
You've got your eye on him?

00:30:20.510 --> 00:30:22.040
Mr. Lu told you to talk less.

00:30:22.740 --> 00:30:23.740
Stop chattering.

00:30:30.350 --> 00:30:31.510
Hello. Nice to meet you.

00:30:31.510 --> 00:30:32.110
Nice to meet you.

00:30:32.110 --> 00:30:32.640
Hello.

00:30:33.350 --> 00:30:33.970
Hi.

00:30:35.110 --> 00:30:35.570
Please.

00:30:36.540 --> 00:30:37.150
Thank you.

00:30:43.030 --> 00:30:45.310
These shirts are part of
our company's new collection,

00:30:45.310 --> 00:30:46.750
just showcased on the runway

00:30:46.750 --> 00:30:48.200
by the models.

00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:50.440
I wonder if you two are interested

00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:51.310
in our shirts.

00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:54.640
These shirts are the new styles
produced by their company.

00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:55.770
Are you interested?

00:30:56.690 --> 00:30:58.790
The fabric quality is excellent.

00:30:58.790 --> 00:31:00.430
This lady is also beautiful.

00:31:00.450 --> 00:31:01.650
I'm very interested.

00:31:02.070 --> 00:31:04.470
Mr. Adam is very interested
in your shirts.

00:31:04.550 --> 00:31:05.560
The facbric is great.

00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:07.290
And you are very beautiful too.

00:31:07.550 --> 00:31:09.210
Thank you for the compliment.

00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:11.030
I'm glad you're interested in

00:31:11.030 --> 00:31:12.960
our silk-spun sandwashed shirts.

00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:14.400
Actually, this style

00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:17.130
is very popular
in the American market right now.

00:31:18.070 --> 00:31:21.230
These styles are popular
in Europe and America.

00:31:22.740 --> 00:31:25.460
Can they produce them in large quantities?

00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:29.210
Can you produce them in large quantities?

00:31:30.180 --> 00:31:31.110
No problem at all.

00:31:31.110 --> 00:31:31.830
No problem.

00:31:32.110 --> 00:31:34.170
It depends on how many pieces you need

00:31:34.550 --> 00:31:36.200
or what your budget is.

00:31:37.300 --> 00:31:39.630
No problem. What's your budget?

00:31:41.270 --> 00:31:44.480
I need shirts worth about $100,000.

00:31:44.510 --> 00:31:45.370
Can you do that?

00:31:46.830 --> 00:31:48.760
We need shirts totaling $100,000.

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:50.130
Can you handle that?

00:31:53.070 --> 00:31:54.000
No problem.

00:31:54.350 --> 00:31:55.030
Absolutely no problem.

00:31:55.030 --> 00:31:56.720
Let's talk while we drink

00:31:56.720 --> 00:31:59.050
and discuss your specific requirements.

00:31:59.220 --> 00:31:59.910
Hurry!

00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:01.400
Let me do it.

00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:08.400
Mr. Zhong.

00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:10.920
Are the investigation results out?

00:32:13.750 --> 00:32:17.000
The school still
cares about young teachers.

00:32:17.790 --> 00:32:19.640
It's just a suspension without pay.

00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:21.720
They didn't pursue
legal action against you.

00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:23.450
They've been quite fair to you.

00:32:23.550 --> 00:32:24.950
Suspension without pay?

00:32:25.110 --> 00:32:25.680
Yes.

00:32:29.240 --> 00:32:31.100
How many girlfriends do you have?

00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:32.640
What do you mean?

00:32:33.730 --> 00:32:36.830
The school received several anonymous
complaint letters

00:32:36.830 --> 00:32:40.010
claiming you have romantic relationships
with multiple female students.

00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:41.140
That's impossible.

00:32:41.550 --> 00:32:43.080
This is absolutely a rumor.

00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:44.920
I'm puzzled too.

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.110
Did you offend someone?

00:32:48.830 --> 00:32:50.720
Beichuan is definitely
not that kind of person.

00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:53.320
And how can anyone
believe anonymous letters?

00:32:53.460 --> 00:32:54.360
Who wrote these anonymous letters?

00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:55.510
How can someone be so cruel?

00:32:55.510 --> 00:32:57.110
This is clearly defamation.

00:32:57.930 --> 00:33:00.180
Have you ever been alone
with a female student

00:33:00.180 --> 00:33:01.420
in a room?

00:33:01.510 --> 00:33:03.880
Alone with a female student in a room?

00:33:05.670 --> 00:33:06.600
Of course I have.

00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:08.400
In our office,

00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:11.480
in the reference room
of the school library.

00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:13.680
I have to tutor female students
with their homework.

00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:15.270
I can't just kick them out.

00:33:15.790 --> 00:33:16.550
That's true.

00:33:19.510 --> 00:33:20.920
I understand now, Beichuan.

00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:23.400
I think this must be about Tong Tong.

00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:26.450
I remember once
when I came back to the office,

00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:29.250
I saw Tong Tong
running out of here crying.

00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:30.590
Since then,

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:32.860
many students have been secretly

00:33:33.110 --> 00:33:35.040
gossiping about you and Tong Tong.

00:33:44.310 --> 00:33:45.110
Come in.

00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:47.240
Professor Xiang.

00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:50.360
What's wrong, Tong Tong?

00:33:50.540 --> 00:33:52.020
I have an article

00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:53.730
that I'd like you to review.

00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:56.350
Okay, leave it here.

00:33:56.350 --> 00:33:57.550
I'll look at it later.

00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:00.640
I'd like you to look at it now.

00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:03.600
This is an article I want to submit
to the school newspaper.

00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:05.750
I'd like your feedback.

00:34:11.710 --> 00:34:12.510
It's not long,

00:34:12.889 --> 00:34:13.889
just 5,000 words.

00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:25.560
The beginning is well-written.

00:34:27.250 --> 00:34:29.110
Could you please review all of it?

00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:31.150
I feel that the middle part,

00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:32.880
especially toward the end,

00:34:33.150 --> 00:34:34.810
isn't quite satisfying to me.

00:34:35.190 --> 00:34:37.989
Please give me
some suggestions for improvement.

00:34:39.199 --> 00:34:40.810
Tong Tong, it's like this.

00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:43.360
I have some work to finish right now.

00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:44.440
When I'm done,

00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:46.969
I'll take my time
to review it properly, okay?

00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:52.170
Then you can continue with your work.

00:34:52.170 --> 00:34:53.820
I'll read it aloud to you.

00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:57.710
The youthful days,

00:34:57.800 --> 00:35:00.360
with grassy playgrounds,

00:35:00.530 --> 00:35:01.470
tree-lined paths, and classrooms

00:35:01.470 --> 00:35:03.280
-Tong Tong.
-full of the scent of books…

00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:03.910
Tong Tong.

00:35:04.710 --> 00:35:06.480
I don't think you need to read it all.

00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:07.540
I already told you,

00:35:07.590 --> 00:35:09.230
once I finish my current work,

00:35:09.230 --> 00:35:10.960
I'll review it properly later.

00:35:11.790 --> 00:35:14.350
Professor Xiang, what's wrong with you?

00:35:14.630 --> 00:35:16.480
I ask you to review it, but you won't.

00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:19.080
I offer to read it,
but you don't want to listen.

00:35:19.370 --> 00:35:20.920
What are you so busy with anyway?

00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:21.850
As a teacher,

00:35:21.870 --> 00:35:24.470
shouldn't your students
be your top priority?

00:35:24.550 --> 00:35:25.150
Tong Tong.

00:35:25.710 --> 00:35:28.000
I'm not putting students second.

00:35:28.350 --> 00:35:30.680
I really do have work
that needs to be done.

00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:32.750
Don't you want me
to give you honest feedback?

00:35:32.750 --> 00:35:33.670
I need to read it properly.

00:35:33.670 --> 00:35:34.670
Professor Xiang.

00:35:35.190 --> 00:35:36.840
Do you look down on me?

00:35:36.870 --> 00:35:38.780
Do you think I can't write anything good?

00:35:38.780 --> 00:35:41.070
I-I don't look down on you.

00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:43.190
You're just one of my regular students.

00:35:43.190 --> 00:35:45.440
Of course I treat you
the same as everyone else.

00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:46.230
I don't care.

00:35:46.470 --> 00:35:48.100
I want you to review it now.

00:35:48.710 --> 00:35:49.640
Look, Tong Tong,

00:35:50.110 --> 00:35:52.440
we can't be unreasonable like this, okay?

00:35:52.550 --> 00:35:54.230
After I finish my current work,

00:35:54.230 --> 00:35:55.590
I'll review it properly for you.

00:35:55.590 --> 00:35:56.190
Okay?

00:35:57.410 --> 00:35:58.050
Tong Tong,

00:35:58.080 --> 00:35:59.160
well...

00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:01.860
What's happening?

00:36:03.770 --> 00:36:04.440
Mr. Guo.

00:36:04.470 --> 00:36:05.150
Tong Tong,

00:36:05.550 --> 00:36:06.480
what's going on?

00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:07.840
Hello, Mr. Guo.

00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:09.280
Goodbye, Mr. Guo.

00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:16.040
What's wrong with Tong Tong?

00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:17.720
I don't know.

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:19.550
She just suddenly got like this.

00:36:19.550 --> 00:36:20.840
I saw she was crying.

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:23.960
It's baffling.

00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:33.070
Mr. Zhong.

00:36:34.670 --> 00:36:36.710
I'm really being wronged here.

00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:38.740
And this situation...

00:36:40.550 --> 00:36:42.280
It's really hard to explain.

00:36:45.290 --> 00:36:47.480
We just resolved
the issue with Shang Yunfei.

00:36:47.480 --> 00:36:49.680
And now another female student pops up.

00:36:51.640 --> 00:36:55.480
Do you think there's something wrong
with how I interact with people?

00:36:55.480 --> 00:36:56.280
Beichuan.

00:36:56.800 --> 00:36:59.270
You absolutely don't need to
question your character.

00:36:59.270 --> 00:37:01.150
There's definitely
nothing wrong with your conduct.

00:37:01.150 --> 00:37:01.800
Mr. Zhong.

00:37:02.110 --> 00:37:04.190
I must speak up
about this matter with Beichuan.

00:37:04.190 --> 00:37:06.030
Otherwise, let's go see
the principal right now.

00:37:06.030 --> 00:37:07.840
We'll explain everything clearly to him.

00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:10.760
Going to the principal will only backfire.

00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:13.070
Is this something to celebrate?

00:37:13.070 --> 00:37:13.800
Besides,

00:37:14.130 --> 00:37:16.660
do you want to drag
the students into this too?

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:19.690
Look,

00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:21.400
go home and calm down first.

00:37:21.590 --> 00:37:23.920
Let the department figure out a solution.

00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:26.440
Yes, Beichuan,

00:37:26.620 --> 00:37:27.750
listen to Mr. Zhong.

00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:29.460
Go home and collect yourself.

00:37:30.710 --> 00:37:31.400
Mr. Zhong,

00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:33.000
none of us have classes tomorrow morning.

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:35.760
Let's gather all the faculty
from our department tomorrow morning.

00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:37.440
We can discuss this together

00:37:37.710 --> 00:37:39.320
and find a solution for Beichuan.

00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:39.960
Alright.

00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:41.320
Fine.

00:37:42.260 --> 00:37:42.940
Beichuan,

00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:45.120
relax. It's going to be okay.

00:37:46.190 --> 00:37:47.760
I'll investigate thoroughly these days

00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:51.220
to find out who's so malicious
to write that anonymous letter.

00:38:09.590 --> 00:38:10.280
Ye.

00:38:11.510 --> 00:38:12.970
What a beautiful bouquet.

00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:15.210
Which boyfriend gave it to you?

00:38:15.590 --> 00:38:17.520
I don't have that many boyfriends.

00:38:18.210 --> 00:38:19.230
I'm just kidding.

00:38:19.960 --> 00:38:21.070
It's from me.

00:38:21.070 --> 00:38:21.870
Do you like it?

00:38:22.030 --> 00:38:22.800
I love it.

00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:24.130
It's really beautiful.

00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:25.360
About the order,

00:38:25.550 --> 00:38:27.290
the foreign clients are very interested.

00:38:27.290 --> 00:38:29.690
I want to thank you
on behalf of the company.

00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:30.580
It's my job.

00:38:31.230 --> 00:38:31.830
By the way,

00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:34.180
you need to make a trip to customs.

00:38:35.030 --> 00:38:37.290
We have a shipment of cashmere sweaters,

00:38:37.890 --> 00:38:40.150
but they returned our declaration form.

00:38:40.220 --> 00:38:42.250
But Mr. Lu, about the customs matter,

00:38:42.250 --> 00:38:43.880
didn't you always
handle that yourself before?

00:38:43.880 --> 00:38:44.840
Not this time.

00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:46.190
You'll have to step in.

00:38:46.190 --> 00:38:48.000
I'm not very familiar with it.

00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:49.800
They have a new section chief,

00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:50.930
named Shan Huajing.

00:38:51.030 --> 00:38:51.690
Shan Hua...

00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:53.840
She's your schoolmate, right?

00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:55.400
Yes, she was my senior at school.

00:38:55.400 --> 00:38:56.000
Exactly.

00:38:56.330 --> 00:38:58.000
So it's all up to you now.

00:38:58.480 --> 00:39:00.550
Alright, I'll go talk to her.

00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:01.760
Thank you for making the trip.

00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:02.420
No problem.

00:39:04.150 --> 00:39:05.620
Mr. Lu, thank you for the flowers.

00:39:05.620 --> 00:39:06.600
You're welcome.

00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:08.340
I'll be going then.

00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:10.260
Thanks for your hard work.

00:39:15.690 --> 00:39:17.290
Hello, I'd like to register.

00:39:25.670 --> 00:39:26.360
Miss Ye.

00:39:27.070 --> 00:39:29.590
Beichuan, you're here
for customs declaration too?

00:39:29.590 --> 00:39:30.720
Yan Jun sent me here.

00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:32.590
Who are you looking for?

00:39:32.590 --> 00:39:34.590
He told me to find
a section chief surnamed Shan.

00:39:34.590 --> 00:39:35.630
I'm also looking for Section Chief Shan.

00:39:35.630 --> 00:39:37.290
She was my senior from school.

00:39:38.140 --> 00:39:39.170
Then your paperwork

00:39:39.170 --> 00:39:41.070
should go through smoothly, right?

00:39:41.070 --> 00:39:41.800
I hope so.

00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:43.760
Don't be nervous when you go in.

00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:44.620
Just have a good chat.

00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:45.550
I'm not nervous.

00:39:47.670 --> 00:39:48.530
It's your turn.

00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:49.960
You should go now.

00:39:50.630 --> 00:39:52.320
Miss Ye, why don't you go first?

00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:53.320
I'm not in a hurry.

00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:54.480
Ladies first, after all.

00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:55.030
Alright.

00:39:55.190 --> 00:39:56.480
That's quite gentlemanly of you.

00:39:56.480 --> 00:39:57.340
I'll go in then.

00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:06.400
Come in.

00:40:11.550 --> 00:40:12.360
Senior.

00:40:16.710 --> 00:40:18.640
Please call me Section Chief Shan.

00:40:20.590 --> 00:40:21.250
Have a seat.

00:40:26.150 --> 00:40:27.280
Section Chief Shan.

00:40:27.590 --> 00:40:29.800
My apologies. I addressed you as "senior"

00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:31.230
since we are fellow alumni.

00:40:31.230 --> 00:40:32.230
We went to the same school.

00:40:32.230 --> 00:40:34.090
I graduated a few years after you.

00:40:35.390 --> 00:40:37.120
What business are you here for?

00:40:37.550 --> 00:40:38.960
Lu Guoyao, Mr. Lu.

00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:40.090
You know him, right?

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:42.510
The name sounds familiar.

00:40:42.510 --> 00:40:44.050
But I don't know him personally.

00:40:44.050 --> 00:40:45.110
What's this about?

00:40:45.190 --> 00:40:46.670
These are our company's
customs declaration forms.

00:40:46.670 --> 00:40:47.730
Please take a look.

00:40:47.910 --> 00:40:49.510
Fine, just leave them there.

00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:55.920
Mr. Lu really trusts you.

00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:57.710
Before I came,
he specifically instructed me

00:40:57.710 --> 00:40:59.920
to seek your guidance and advice.

00:41:01.190 --> 00:41:04.480
This shipment is extremely important
for our company.

00:41:05.550 --> 00:41:08.590
Which company doesn't think
their shipment is important?

00:41:08.590 --> 00:41:09.400
Right.

00:41:10.550 --> 00:41:13.010
Mainly because we're a private enterprise.

00:41:13.210 --> 00:41:15.870
Private businesses
are struggling to survive.

00:41:16.190 --> 00:41:17.200
In particular, Mr. Lu.

00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:19.070
He has a background
in a state-owned enterprise.

00:41:19.070 --> 00:41:20.690
Now he has to take on

00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:23.130
the survival issues of laid-off workers.

00:41:23.190 --> 00:41:25.050
So it's really difficult for him.

00:41:26.010 --> 00:41:28.070
Section Chief Shan, this shipment of ours

00:41:28.070 --> 00:41:30.020
has already been delayed for some time.

00:41:30.020 --> 00:41:31.710
We can't afford any more delays.

00:41:31.710 --> 00:41:32.570
So

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:35.800
I hope you can give us
some special consideration.

00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:39.800
Special consideration?

00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:41.440
What kind of consideration?

00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:43.640
That's not what I meant.

00:41:43.640 --> 00:41:44.840
What do you mean then?

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:48.330
Is there anything else?

00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:49.960
Next!

00:41:55.310 --> 00:41:56.770
Okay, I'll head out first.

00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:04.510
Hello.

00:42:09.590 --> 00:42:10.790
Yan Jun sent you here?

00:42:13.840 --> 00:42:15.970
Yan Jun and I were college classmates.

00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:20.330
[Admission Notice for New Students,
Shanghai Shude High School]

00:42:22.440 --> 00:42:23.070
Alright.

00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:25.280
Go back and tell Mr. Yan

00:42:25.330 --> 00:42:26.990
I've received the documents.

00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:28.960
About this matter, give me two days.

00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:30.630
It should be done in about two days.

00:42:30.630 --> 00:42:31.170
Okay.

00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:33.300
I'll be going then.

00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:33.890
Okay.

00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:34.520
Thank you.

00:42:43.090 --> 00:42:44.820
Why did you come out so quickly?

00:42:47.070 --> 00:42:50.070
Section Chief Shan is
difficult to talk to, isn't she?

00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:52.000
She's easy to talk to.

00:42:55.190 --> 00:42:56.550
So what did you tell her?

00:42:56.640 --> 00:42:57.700
I didn't really...

00:42:58.920 --> 00:43:01.380
I told her I was
Yan Jun's college classmate.

00:43:01.380 --> 00:43:03.190
She said okay
and that she'd take care of it.

00:43:03.190 --> 00:43:04.190
Then she let me go.

00:43:08.550 --> 00:43:09.880
Well, you can go back first.

00:43:09.880 --> 00:43:12.540
I'm going to wait here
a bit longer for my senior.

00:43:13.070 --> 00:43:14.190
Okay, I'll head out then.
