00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.840
Welcome to the most glamorous show

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.640
in the land of Saenya—

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.400
Saenya Tonight!

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.560
And tonight,

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.280
you’ll be meeting a singer
adored by half the nation—

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.600
and absolutely hated by the other half.

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.160
Every event she joins,

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.320
every appearance she makes—

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.000
the cops knock on her door
the very next morning.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.720
But she doesn’t care one bit.

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.920
And now, the moment is here.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.240
Please welcome Prince—

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.600
and her brand-new single,

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.040
“This is Me.”

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.600
Well, my life is fabulous anyway.

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.920
So make your choice
before you close your eyes.

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:41.360
- Save it.
- Slay.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:42.960
Save.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.200
Gorgeous.

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:53.079
- Hey.
- Nat.

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.200
Take a pic of me real quick,
I’m sending it to a guy.

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.720
Okay, okay, wow.

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:59.880
Strike a good pose.

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.520
Okay.

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.120
One, two, three.

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.240
Fabulous.

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:07.880
- Did it come out good?
- Let’s see.

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:09.240
Let me send it to him first.

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.480
Prince is ready!

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.240
Oh my god, look at all the men.

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:19.680
There’s a whole crowd over here too.

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:20.800
Are those fans?

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:22.960
Haters, you ready?

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.760
- Get out.
- Get out.

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.480
- Get out.
- Get out.

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.800
- Get out.
- Get out.

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.080
- Get out.
- Get out.

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.920
- Get out.
- Get out.

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.280
- Get out.
- Get out.

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.960
- Get out.
- Get out.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.080
(Freaking tranny)
(Shame on you - Disgusting pervert.)

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.880
- Get out.
- Get out.

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.000
- Get out.
- Get out.

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:54.320
- Get out.
- Get out.

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.600
- Get out.
- Get out.

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.360
Just for confidence.

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.480
Oh—this is the women’s restroom.

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.160
When will this world

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:12.920
stop dividing us by male and female?

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:30.200
Welcome to heaven, Prince.

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:21.960
Where is this?

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:23.840
Is this a guy’s house?

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:31.800
Who the hell did I go home with last night?

00:07:37.159 --> 00:07:39.520
Is that the guy I slept with?

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:56.880
A g-... ghost?

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:01.080
Wait for me!

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
Let’s go. Let’s go.

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:06.360
What kind of ghost is this pretty?

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:11.640
You.

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:14.800
What’s wrong with those people?

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:17.800
They’re just scared of you, sir.

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:21.120
Wait... sir, you’re not actually dead?

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:24.640
Me? Dead?

00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:27.680
Queens don’t die easy, babe.

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:30.840
And… where exactly is this place?

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:32.440
Is this your house?

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:35.960
Then… that means...

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:37.960
Last night…

00:08:38.919 --> 00:08:40.520
Did something happen between us?

00:08:41.679 --> 00:08:43.240
Uh… something?

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:45.280
Something what, sir?

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:47.680
This is your room, sir.

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:50.280
My room?

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:02.720
Or is this some kind of spa?

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:03.880
But...

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:06.440
I didn’t book any spa.

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:08.320
I’ve got rehearsal all day today.

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:14.080
What the—

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:15.520
My hair!

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:20.720
It’s fried!

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:22.600
Ugh!

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:25.280
Who the hell dressed me in this?

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:29.960
I’ve got it!

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:33.640
This has to be some kind of reality show.

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:36.840
But do they go this far nowadays?

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:39.120
Drugging me?

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:41.040
Putting me in a traditional outfit?

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:43.000
Redoing my whole look?

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:46.680
And then...

00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:47.760
A camera—

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:49.760
Where’s the camera? Where is it?

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:51.320
Where is it?

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:54.600
Wow, hidden pretty well.

00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:56.240
What are you saying, sir?

00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:58.040
I don’t understand.

00:09:58.080 --> 00:09:59.560
Hmph.

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:02.680
So, you're playing the servant, right?

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:05.600
Fine. You wanna play? Let’s play.

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:07.120
But just so you know—

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:08.880
If the show’s pulling this much on me...

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:12.400
I’m gonna charge a premium, darling.

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:14.360
Well, since we're doing this...

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:17.160
I might as well go full diva on you.

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:21.640
One, two, three...

00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:23.240
Action!

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:28.560
Sir, sir, where are you going?

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:33.680
Wow.

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:44.400
Hey, is this show like period-themed or what?

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:47.280
Then what should my character's name be?

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:49.560
Ubon? Lady Karakade?

00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:50.960
Or Nang Wanthong?

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.680
Worradej.

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:55.080
Whose name is that? So tacky.

00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:58.800
You're seriously not dead.

00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:02.920
Hello there, Uncle.

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:05.200
What part are you playing, huh?

00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:11.000
You wake up and go nuts?

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:12.680
Should’ve just died and saved us all.

00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:14.840
Now you're just a curse on this household.

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:17.760
Such strong energy.

00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:19.840
But seriously, Uncle, what role are you playing?

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:21.760
So I can act along properly.

00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:23.240
Hey, you—

00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:26.160
What role is this uncle
playing so I can match it?

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:29.520
Uh... he's the noble father
of the young master, sir.

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:31.240
Got it.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
Strict dad who hates queers, classic trope.

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:36.240
Alright then.

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:38.560
Let me show you how it’s done.

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:40.720
Ouch!

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:43.880
Dear noble father!

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:47.160
Your child has not yet perished, my lord!

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:50.000
Until my dreams are fulfilled—

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:52.880
The day I win seven Grammy Awards—

00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:54.760
Every single one of them!

00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:58.280
Only then will I
tui ye wa ta na be aiko, my lord!

00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:04.320
What? You don’t believe me?

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:07.080
Then, dear noble father, have a listen—

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:09.040
To my brand-new single.

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:12.840
See if it might win me any awards.

00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:42.600
Well? Was it fabulous?

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.720
Applause, please. Come on, applause!

00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:48.040
Clap for me, now!

00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:50.960
So what do you think, noble father? Was it fierce?

00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:52.800
- Ugh
- Sir!

00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:56.160
Hey, Uncle!

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:57.280
What kind of acting is that?

00:12:57.280 --> 00:12:59.120
You're not even supporting your co-star!

00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:01.120
Ever heard of camera angles?

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:02.920
You must be possessed by some evil spirit.

00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:04.880
I’ll beat you till it leaves your body.

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:06.720
Will you leave my child or not?

00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:09.240
Will you leave— Jade, get out of the way!

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:10.560
Will you leave my child or not?

00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:12.600
Will you leave? Huh? Will you?

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:13.960
That’s enough.

00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:15.080
Stop it right now.

00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:16.600
Cut the drama, with that damn stick.

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:18.840
Quit playing around already.

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:20.680
Stop playing?

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:26.760
Sir. Sir!

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.200
Sir!

00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:30.080
Lock him up in the house.

00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:32.800
Don’t let him go out
and shame us in front of the villagers.

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:35.560
Having a lunatic for a son is a disgrace.

00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:36.880
Yes, sir.

00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:40.320
Sir!

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:41.480
Sir!

00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:56.560
My Lord.

00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:20.840
Who are you?

00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:23.560
And where am I?

00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:25.480
Tell me, please.

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:27.560
You are me.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
And you're now in my place.

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:33.880
And you must help fulfill my deepest desire.

00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:35.640
What desire?

00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:37.160
What is it that you want?

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:39.080
My desire…

00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:40.920
…is the same as yours.

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:42.840
My desire...

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:44.760
...is your desire.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.680
My desire...

00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:48.480
...is your desire.

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:52.080
My desire is your desire.

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:55.480
Wait.

00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:57.640
Where did she go?

00:14:58.360 --> 00:14:59.520
Hold on.

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:01.320
Come back here.

00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:03.240
We’re not done talking.

00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:06.720
Hey, come back.

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:08.520
We’re not done talking.

00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:09.760
You ancient ghost.

00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:13.400
Come back here.

00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:17.800
I've prepared the medicine, sir.

00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:19.560
How are you feeling, sir?

00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:21.280
Hey, you.

00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:23.400
Let me ask you seriously.

00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:26.000
Don’t mess around. No more jokes.

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:28.520
Where the hell is this place?

00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:31.120
This is the residence
of Chao Phraya Singhanakhon,

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:33.920
Lord Aksakhet Prawetdao Damrongburirat.

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:36.840
Is that a person's name?

00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:39.040
That’s your father's full name, sir.

00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:41.040
He is the governor of Singhanakhon.

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:43.000
Don’t you remember anything at all, sir?

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:46.000
Singhanakhon...

00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:49.920
And where in the country
of Saenya is this Singhanakhon?

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:51.800
The country of Saenya?

00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:53.640
I’ve never heard of such a place, sir.

00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:56.640
Singhanakhon is
in the Kingdom of Thanapura, sir.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.440
Thanapura?

00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:04.760
Thanapura...

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:07.600
A kingdom that existed
before the country of Saenya?

00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:10.520
Our beloved Saenya...

00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:12.400
...has existed for over 200 years now.

00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:14.240
Since the day it was founded.

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:15.400
Mr. Pinyapat.

00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:19.080
Yes?

00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:20.200
Answer me.

00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:22.400
Before it became Saenya,

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:25.920
what was this land called?

00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:30.360
The Kingdom of Tempura.

00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:33.600
Looks like it’s almost lunchtime.

00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:35.240
You must be hungry.

00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:37.360
Okay then, friends, tell me—

00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:38.680
What kingdom was it?

00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:41.640
- Thanapura!
- Thanapura!

00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:43.600
Remember this—

00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:45.000
Thanapura.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.200
Not Tempura.

00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:49.600
Now tell me—

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:52.800
Who was the last king
of the Thanawong dynasty

00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:55.120
in the Kingdom of Thanapura?

00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:56.760
What was his name?

00:16:58.800 --> 00:16:59.800
Chaiyached, sir.

00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:01.560
The current reigning monarch...

00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:03.280
...is King Chaiyached.

00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:15.960
Oh my god.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.160
Did I seriously just
travel back hundreds of years?

00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:20.880
Guys.

00:17:21.119 --> 00:17:22.560
Cover your ears.

00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:23.960
Why cover our ears, sir?

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.920
I said cover your ears.

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:39.520
Sir.

00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:42.080
Here’s your lime honey, sir.

00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:46.040
Thanks, dear.

00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:50.880
Sir.

00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:52.840
Please don’t overthink it.

00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:54.240
It might be the medicine...

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:56.040
...messing with your thoughts.

00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:57.440
Please eat something first.

00:17:57.440 --> 00:17:58.640
Once you’re full,

00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:00.600
your memory might come back.

00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:04.280
Wow, that looks delicious.

00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:05.520
So...

00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:07.320
Where are the spoon and fork?

00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:09.440
You usually eat with your hands, sir.

00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:11.280
My hands?

00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:12.400
Like...

00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:14.120
Grab sticky rice with my fingers?

00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:15.400
You can give it a try.

00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:17.520
Um, wait a second, sir.

00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:19.800
You need to dip
your hand in this basin first.

00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:28.200
If this wasn’t the past,

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:29.960
a hand touch like that—

00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:32.280
It means someone’s into you.

00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:36.040
Sir.

00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:37.120
I do.

00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:44.520
Alright then, I’m gonna eat now.

00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:49.600
Um, that’s not how you do it, sir.

00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:52.000
Please watch me, sir.

00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:53.880
Allow me, sir.

00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:55.120
Use three fingers.

00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:56.600
Roll them into a circle.

00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:57.600
Like this, sir.

00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:05.680
Okay, I’ll give it a try then.

00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:11.080
Wait—hey, you.

00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:12.280
Sit down first.

00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:13.920
Sit down.

00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:15.400
We’ve been talking for ages,

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:17.120
but I still don’t know your name.

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:18.400
What’s your name?

00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:19.600
Uh...

00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:21.000
It’s Jade, sir.

00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:24.160
You don’t even remember my name, sir?

00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:25.880
I don’t remember anything at all.

00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:28.640
I don’t even know who I am.

00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:31.480
Your name is Count Worradej Weerakitchamnan.

00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:34.280
Just call you Count Worradej for short.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.200
That name’s long and old-fashioned.

00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:41.520
This medicine really is intense.

00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:44.520
It wiped your memory clean, sir.

00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:46.760
But it’s good you’re awake now.

00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:49.280
Even if you can’t remember,
it’s better than being dead.

00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:51.000
You know what, sir?

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.480
I almost cried myself to death.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.160
Hey...

00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:57.960
Since we’re here already—

00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:00.160
What exactly happened?

00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:02.120
So what kind of drug was it?

00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:03.880
What did I take?

00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:07.440
Lord Banjong said you were heartbroken.

00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:09.200
So you took poison and died.

00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:11.160
Count Kosol was the one who found you.

00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:13.080
He brought your body back himself.

00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:17.480
Heartbroken and decided to die?

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:20.280
Were you depressed, Worradej?

00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:23.120
So who was I in love with?

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:24.520
No one knows, sir.

00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:26.440
You never told anyone.

00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:29.640
But everyone in town
gossips about one person.

00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:31.040
Who?

00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:32.720
Lord Kosol, sir.

00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:34.800
They all say—

00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:36.920
You and Lord Kosol...

00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:39.360
Go on.

00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:43.120
They say you and Lord Kosol
were lovers in secret.

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:48.800
That name—Lord Kosol—sounds familiar too.

00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:51.040
If I meet him,

00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:53.880
maybe I’ll find out what really happened.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.360
And then...

00:20:56.960 --> 00:20:57.960
Jade.

00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:00.680
Take me to see Lord Kosol tomorrow.

00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:15.640
This way, sir.

00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:32.480
Jade?

00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:35.440
Do I look pretty?

00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:36.560
Very pretty, sir.

00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:41.240
Isn’t this the way into the forest?

00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:42.840
Yes, sir.

00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:45.760
But we’re going to Lord Kosol’s house.

00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:47.320
Yes, sir.

00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:49.920
His house is in the forest.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.600
A house or a bandit’s den?

00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:54.080
Lord Kosol is a bit of an odd one.

00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:55.920
- Doesn’t mix with people much.
- Thief!

00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:57.800
Help! Someone catch the thief!

00:21:57.800 --> 00:21:59.880
Help me, please! Catch him!

00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:04.080
Help me catch him! Please!

00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:06.080
Catch the thief! Somebody help!

00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:16.360
You bastard!

00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:19.160
It’s just one old cloth and you still steal it?

00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:20.320
Give it back!

00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:30.080
I’m sorry, sir.

00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:32.640
I didn’t mean to do it.

00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:34.120
Didn’t know you were someone important.

00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:35.520
I truly apologize, sir.

00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:38.440
Why are you apologizing to a thief?

00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:40.920
Whether he's someone important or not,

00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:43.960
stealing is still a crime.

00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:45.360
You don’t need to apologize.

00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:47.400
Call the police and have him arrested!

00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:48.720
Who are you?

00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:49.800
Why are you meddling?

00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:52.160
If the owner won’t press charges,

00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:54.000
why are you getting worked up?

00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:56.400
You got your stuff back. Now scram.

00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:57.560
Yes, sir.

00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:00.280
Come back here, please.

00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:01.440
Please, wait!

00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:04.000
If anyone should be arrested, it’s you.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:05.600
You tripped me and I fell.

00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:07.520
That’s physical assault.

00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:09.320
Sweetie,

00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:12.360
where did you get all that confidence from?

00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:14.200
You’re great at blaming others.

00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:15.800
So you're completely innocent, huh?

00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:17.360
Please don’t get into it, sir.

00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:19.120
Judging by her clothes,

00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:20.680
she’s probably of higher status.

00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:22.480
Let’s just move on quickly.

00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:25.440
Fine, I’ll go.

00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:26.960
But staying here...

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:29.440
I might end up slapping someone bald.

00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:55.160
Hey! Why are you following me?

00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:56.800
Planning to rob me too?

00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:58.720
Is this forest built by your father?

00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:00.120
Why can’t I walk here?

00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:01.880
I didn’t say you couldn’t.

00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:03.480
Just don’t follow me, alright?

00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:05.000
Who said I’m following you?

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.800
You’re the one following me.

00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:09.240
Then just tell me which way you’re going.

00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:10.920
I’ll walk in the opposite direction.

00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:12.920
So we’re done and can split up.

00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:14.200
I’m going to Lord Kosol’s house.

00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:16.080
Do you know where that is?

00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:21.960
Are you bringing your friend to rob me too?

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:23.800
They’re not with me. I’m not one of them!

00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:26.680
Sir, this way.

00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:28.480
Wait for me!

00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:32.240
Help! Somebody help!

00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:39.760
Please don’t hurt me.

00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:42.640
I’m just a tiny little queer
who just rose from the dead.

00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:44.480
There’s nothing worth stealing here.

00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:45.800
Nothing at all.

00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:48.960
Hey, you—

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.440
Your necklace, rings,
watch—just give them what they want.

00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:52.560
You wanna die?

00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:53.960
They’re not here for the bling.

00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:55.040
They want blood.

00:24:58.080 --> 00:25:00.240
If you want my life,
you’ll have to go through his first.

00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:05.720
No one harms my master
without crossing my corpse.

00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:29.360
Are you alright, sir?

00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:30.800
I’m fine.

00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:32.600
But, Jade—

00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:33.880
Who was that guy?

00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:35.160
That’s Lord Kosol, sir.

00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:37.480
The one rumored to have deep ties with you.

00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:40.960
Oh. My. God.

00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:45.320
Girl, your man is so hot
I might just faint and die on the spot.

00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:55.640
My Lord.

00:25:58.520 --> 00:25:59.680
What are you doing here?

00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:01.200
Are you not afraid of dying?

00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:02.680
I came to see you, of course.

00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:04.600
With you by my side,

00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:06.000
no one can harm me.

00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:07.960
Not even those petty little bandits.

00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:12.240
And what about you?

00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:14.040
Weren’t you supposed to be dead?

00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:17.640
I rose from the dead...

00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:19.040
just to come see you.

00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:26.080
Why are the tributes from
the northern provinces so scarce?

00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:27.840
Did you even check thoroughly?

00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:31.040
But I’ve double-checked multiple times, sir.

00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:33.520
Let go! Why am I being dragged here?

00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:35.040
You’ll find out soon enough.

00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:41.360
Didn’t I tell you to stay away from my son?

00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:43.360
Now you come barging in like this—

00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:45.080
Do you have no shame?

00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:47.440
Or do you think your royal blood
makes you untouchable?

00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:50.520
Your title was stripped long ago.

00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:52.640
You’re nothing more than a commoner now.

00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:54.880
Even as a commoner,

00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:58.080
I’d still stand taller
than traitors like you.

00:26:58.120 --> 00:26:59.200
How dare you!

00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:00.880
Who are you calling a traitor?

00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:03.640
Soldiers, arrest Kosol for treason.

00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:08.800
Arrest him now!

00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:10.800
Yeah, seriously.

00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:12.280
Who exactly...

00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:13.440
is the real traitor here?

00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:15.400
The one who ambushed me in the forest?

00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:17.240
King Chaiyached.

00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:19.440
Don’t tell me this spoiled brat—

00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:21.320
is actually King Chaiyached?

00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:23.840
The last monarch of Thanapura?

00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:35.120
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:38.200
I wasn’t aware Your Majesty
would arrive earlier than planned.

00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:39.920
So I failed to prepare a proper welcome.

00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:42.360
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:45.440
Forget that matter.

00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:48.520
Let’s focus on the fact
that someone tried to assassinate me.

00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:50.320
It happened in your city.

00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:52.920
Do you have any clues
about who was behind it?

00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:57.120
In my territory,

00:27:57.800 --> 00:28:00.000
there’s no place for
traitors or bandits to hide.

00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:03.120
Except perhaps...

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:06.600
Kosol’s residence.

00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:08.720
Out near the edge of the forest.

00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:11.400
He’s never let officials enter
and search it, Your Majesty.

00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:14.440
This sword belonged to the bandits.

00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:17.120
It bears the insignia of Singha City’s army.

00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:18.920
And yet you still dare accuse me?

00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:24.960
Many of my men’s swords
were stolen and sold on the black market.

00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:27.480
With just this little proof,

00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:29.760
you intend to incriminate me?

00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:32.080
And what about you?

00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:33.920
What were you doing at the crime scene?

00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:36.480
Weren’t you the one
who led the bandits there?

00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:42.320
Worradej.

00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:44.000
Tell your father.

00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:46.520
Who was the one that saved
Chaiyached from the bandits?

00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:49.560
Answer.

00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:51.280
It was you, of course.

00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:52.920
Fierce and fearless.

00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:55.280
Took out every bandit alone.

00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:57.480
Then why didn’t you leave at least one alive?

00:28:57.520 --> 00:29:00.440
We could’ve interrogated them
to find out who gave the order.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:02.320
Or was it because...

00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:04.440
you wanted to silence them?

00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:07.320
Worradej, tell His Majesty,

00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:08.960
that Kosol...

00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:11.560
is the one who conspired against the throne.

00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:14.440
Lord Kosol.

00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:17.400
That’s a name everyone better remember.

00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:21.200
He’s the half-brother of King Chaiyached.

00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:23.480
He’s ruthless to the core.

00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:25.400
Ambitious as hell too.

00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:27.000
So tell me—

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:28.640
what chaos did he stir up?

00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:31.040
If the teacher’s saying this much,

00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:33.200
he must've killed his own brother.

00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:35.120
To crown himself King, right?

00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:36.520
Exactly.

00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:39.560
But before Lord Kosol could steal the throne—

00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:41.560
King Saenyakorn gathered his forces

00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:43.760
to crush the rebel Lord Kosol.

00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:46.000
And then he crowned himself king.

00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:47.640
The very first of the Saenya dynasty.

00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:51.240
He changed the name of this land—

00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:53.040
and called it Saenya ever since.

00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:56.600
Wait... am I living through
a major historical moment?

00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:59.960
If I say Kosol was behind the attack...

00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:01.360
and he gets arrested—

00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:03.280
then King Chaiyached keeps ruling.

00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:04.520
Which means...

00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:07.000
the country of Saenya might never exist.

00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:09.800
Should I just shut up
and let history run its course?

00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:12.920
Or speak up and change everything?

00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:15.080
Worradej.

00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:16.760
Why won’t you speak?

00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:18.720
Tell us what you know about your father.

00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:20.040
Is he a traitor?

00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:21.840
Can you not pressure me right now?

00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:23.520
I need to talk to myself first.

00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:27.080
If I know Kosol’s
planning to kill his brother...

00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:28.720
shouldn’t I speak up?

00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:31.040
I should do what’s right, shouldn’t I?

00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:32.400
But if I tell them...

00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:34.520
That would totally rewrite history!

00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:36.800
Ugh, my head’s spinning.

00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:38.080
Time’s up.

00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:40.800
Tell everyone who the real traitor is.

00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:53.040
Lord Kosol is the traitor.

00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:55.400
He plotted to assassinate King Chaiyached

00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:57.120
and steal the throne for himself.

00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:00.480
Soldiers, seize Lord Kosol.

00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:02.920
Wait.

00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:05.520
Worradej just came back from the dead.

00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:07.840
His mind might not be stable yet.

00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:09.240
I suggest...

00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:11.600
we postpone the verdict.

00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:13.200
But Your Majesty—

00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:14.800
I'm leaving.

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:16.000
Your Majesty!

00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:18.640
This is a matter of life and death!

00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:20.000
Your Majesty!

00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:32.000
Let me go— ow!

00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:34.320
Hey! Where are you dragging me?

00:31:34.520 --> 00:31:35.680
Let go!

00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:36.800
Come here!

00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:38.800
- Let me go!
- Big bro!

00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:41.520
Can I stay at your place tonight?

00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:43.800
You’re a king.

00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:46.080
How can you stay at
a lowborn’s shack like mine?

00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:47.720
Go stay at the Singhapiman Palace.

00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:50.400
Nah.

00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:53.400
The palace is boring.
Being with you is way more fun.

00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:56.360
Haven’t seen me in forever— didn’t you miss me?

00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:58.000
No.

00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:01.560
Aw, why so cold-hearted?

00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:05.360
Whatever, I’m still crashing
at your place tonight.

00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:08.680
You’re just scared
of getting ambushed again.

00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:10.680
Just admit it already.

00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:12.360
I know exactly how you think.

00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:14.080
Then why even ask?

00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:15.720
Worradej.

00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:24.080
Where are you taking me?

00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:25.400
Big bro!

00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:29.920
Big bro...

00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:36.800
Careful, would you?

00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:39.840
I’m tiny—why so rough with me?

00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:42.520
You’ve been way mouthier
since coming back to life.

00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:44.080
Wanna die again or what?

00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:46.080
No, please!

00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:47.120
I don’t wanna die yet.

00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:48.360
Then shut your mouth.

00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:53.280
You guys, go find some food
and water for my brother.

00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:56.520
You’ll be staying here with me.

00:32:56.560 --> 00:32:58.040
No titles, no royal status.

00:32:58.120 --> 00:32:59.120
Can you handle that?

00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:00.240
Of course.

00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:02.080
I’m not obsessed with titles anyway.

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:04.000
Good.

00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:05.840
Then wait for me here.

00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:08.760
I’ve got something
to settle with this guy first.

00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:12.200
Big bro—

00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:14.000
Don’t take too long, I’ll be waiting.

00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:26.440
If you’re gonna kill me, go ahead.

00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:28.640
I could never beat you anyway.

00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:29.800
But...

00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:32.360
Please make sure I die looking pretty.

00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:54.120
Help!

00:33:54.680 --> 00:33:56.280
Help!

00:33:57.520 --> 00:33:58.520
What the—

00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:01.840
Help me!

00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:05.680
You were never scared of my pet before.

00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:07.600
Moo Moo.

00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:08.960
Go outside for now.

00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:19.679
What kinda tiger is named Moo Moo?

00:34:19.719 --> 00:34:21.400
What planet am I even on?

00:34:24.159 --> 00:34:25.320
Worradej.

00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:27.000
What is going on with you?

00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:29.040
Why have you changed so much?

00:34:29.159 --> 00:34:31.080
You’re nothing like the person I knew.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.760
I’m still the same old me.

00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:41.080
Maybe it’s the poison.

00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:43.159
Wasn’t it you

00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:44.800
who broke my heart

00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:46.679
and made me take poison to die?

00:34:46.679 --> 00:34:48.120
Me? I broke your heart?

00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:50.280
The day I left for the port city,

00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:52.000
we were still on good terms.

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:53.639
But when I came back,

00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:55.920
I heard you’d already taken poison.

00:34:55.920 --> 00:34:58.120
I seriously doubt it was because of me.

00:34:58.560 --> 00:34:59.600
Wait—

00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:02.080
So Worradej didn’t die from heartbreak?

00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:03.600
Was it because of that Kosol guy?

00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:05.480
So Kosol wasn’t Worradej’s lover after all.

00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:07.800
But what confuses me more is—

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:10.280
why are you suddenly accusing me

00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:12.080
of killing Chaiyached?

00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:14.560
Didn’t we agree already

00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:16.640
that we’d overthrow him

00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:18.480
but not kill him?

00:35:18.840 --> 00:35:21.480
Oh my god.

00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:25.520
So she actually conspired
with Kosol to start a rebellion?

00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:26.720
Why are you quiet now?

00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:28.840
Talking to yourself again?

00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:31.920
Well, um...

00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:34.480
I’ve been kind of spaced out lately.

00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:37.000
I can’t really remember anything.

00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:40.720
Give me a sec to process all this.

00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:44.200
Tell me—

00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:46.760
what are you really plotting?

00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:48.480
Why are you accusing me?

00:35:50.120 --> 00:35:51.600
I’m sorry.

00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:55.760
I’m just really confused right now.

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:57.840
Please don’t hurt me.

00:35:57.840 --> 00:35:59.160
Please.

00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:03.280
Then let me help jog your memory.

00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:28.560
Well? Starting to remember anything yet?

00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:30.120
Tell me—

00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:32.000
what exactly are you planning, Worradej?

00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:34.680
Still can’t really remember.

00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:37.400
Go ahead then, Kosol.

00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:39.760
Still playing tough?

00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:41.080
Let me see what I can do.

00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:43.440
Let’s see if this softens
that mouth of yours.

00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:47.880
Who's that?

00:36:48.040 --> 00:36:49.040
It’s me.

00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:50.680
What are you doing, bro?

00:36:50.680 --> 00:36:52.240
I’m handling some business.

00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:53.640
Wait for me.

00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:55.680
I’ll come find you once I’m done.

00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:56.840
Nope.

00:36:56.840 --> 00:36:57.920
I’m bored.

00:36:57.960 --> 00:36:59.840
Why are you always so busy talking?

00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:01.320
Can I join in?

00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:02.360
No.

00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:03.800
Don’t even think about it.

00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:05.640
Then you come talk to me.

00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:07.120
Come on, now.

00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:09.600
- Come on
- Alright, alright.

00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:11.400
I’m coming, hold on.

00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:15.240
If you try to escape—

00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:18.400
Moo Moo will drag you back to me.

00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:20.840
Between my fangs and Moomoo’s—

00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:23.040
you better choose wisely.

00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:32.320
Four moods in three minutes.

00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:34.600
Is he insane or just misunderstood?

00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:35.960
Ugh.

00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:41.400
Don’t.

00:37:43.360 --> 00:37:45.400
How many times do I have to tell you—

00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:46.840
don’t play with fire.

00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:48.880
Still scary as ever, bro.

00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:53.840
You really came all
the way here to find me?

00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:55.440
Then spit it out already.

00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:59.200
If it's nonsense, I'm sending you back.

00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:01.040
Since I ascended the throne—

00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:03.720
and pardoned you out of prison—

00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:05.600
it’s been almost a year now.

00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:09.080
I just wanted to visit you as a brother would. That’s all.

00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:10.960
Are we really that close?

00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:12.720
Cause I don’t remember that.

00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:18.680
Well, if you’ve visited me already,

00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:22.480
then you can go back now.

00:38:24.080 --> 00:38:25.440
Wait, there’s one more thing.

00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:27.960
I want you to be my royal bodyguard again.

00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:31.680
I’ll restore your title
and name you Chao Phraya.

00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:33.600
Are you interested?

00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:36.160
No.

00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:37.560
I’m not.

00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:40.400
I’ve got important business here.

00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:42.160
Important business...

00:38:42.680 --> 00:38:44.160
Like taking my throne?

00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:47.400
So you already know.

00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:50.360
You act like a child—

00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:53.280
but I didn’t think
your thoughts were childish too.

00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:56.560
Trying to recruit your rival to be your guard?

00:38:57.120 --> 00:38:58.440
Is that what you’re doing?

00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:02.480
I thought maybe giving you a grand title—

00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:04.400
you’d give up the plan.

00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:06.400
But I never thought—

00:39:06.680 --> 00:39:08.400
you’d be this power-hungry.

00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:10.600
Tell me honestly—

00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:12.600
if you got my throne...

00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:14.280
Would you kill me for it?

00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:19.080
Hard to say.

00:39:19.520 --> 00:39:21.240
Guess it depends on the moment.

00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:24.760
Go stay at the Singhapiman Palace.

00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:28.840
If you stay here,
I might just kill you in my sleep.

00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:51.600
You two.

00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:53.480
Keep an eye on my brother.

00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:57.240
While he’s in Singhanakhon,
don’t let him out of your sight.

00:39:57.320 --> 00:40:00.360
Protect him.
Don’t let anyone lay a finger on him.

00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:01.480
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:11.200
Moomoo, you did well.

00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:13.120
I’ll reward you later.

00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:25.720
Moomoo, where did Worradej go?

00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:39.920
We can’t sit around waiting
for that psycho to come back.

00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:41.920
We need to run.

00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:43.720
Run, Prince.

00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:45.080
Run!

00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:01.400
This is insane.

00:41:01.440 --> 00:41:02.840
Of all things to raise—

00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:04.520
he raises a tiger!

00:41:25.160 --> 00:41:26.160
No idea who that is—

00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:28.120
but it’s a man calling.

00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:29.480
Better go for now.

00:41:58.880 --> 00:42:00.160
A...

00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:01.880
H...

00:42:02.040 --> 00:42:03.320
W...

00:42:37.320 --> 00:42:38.720
Hello, Officer.

00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:40.440
Hello, Miss Nat.

00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:42.040
You’re the manager—

00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:45.000
of Mr. Pinyapat,
the singer who goes by Prince, correct?

00:42:45.320 --> 00:42:47.000
Yes. And…

00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:49.600
Has the doctor spoken to the doctor yet?

00:42:49.760 --> 00:42:51.320
Actually, I'm not here about that.

00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:52.960
Here.

00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:56.080
This is a fine notice for Mr. Pinyapat

00:42:56.120 --> 00:42:59.000
for presenting a gender identity
not matching his birth sex

00:42:59.160 --> 00:43:01.000
on last night’s “Sanya Tonight” show.

00:43:01.080 --> 00:43:02.440
Please sign on his behalf.

00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:06.400
What about the case
where Prince got drugged?

00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:08.040
Please sign the document.

00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:09.400
Um…

00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:17.960
Yes?

00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:19.760
Wait, officer.

00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:21.560
– Yes?
– What about the case?

00:43:22.240 --> 00:43:24.600
That’ll have to be
transferred to another unit.

00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:26.840
I’ll be straight with you.

00:43:27.320 --> 00:43:29.440
The escort Prince hired that night

00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:30.960
was working illegally.

00:43:31.240 --> 00:43:33.280
Once things went down, they all ran off.

00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:35.480
Now there’s no evidence left.

00:43:35.520 --> 00:43:37.200
Tracking them down will be tough.

00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:39.760
And Prince has a lot of haters too.

00:43:39.960 --> 00:43:41.520
If he wants to go against his gender,

00:43:41.560 --> 00:43:42.800
then he has to deal with it.

00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:44.120
Excuse me.

00:44:00.520 --> 00:44:02.240
Hey, you.

00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:04.320
Where are we going?

00:44:04.600 --> 00:44:06.040
Taking you home, of course.

00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:07.800
Hurry and get on the boat.

00:44:08.920 --> 00:44:10.880
Wait—hey, wait a sec!

00:44:11.080 --> 00:44:12.800
And who even are you?

00:44:13.160 --> 00:44:14.440
How do you know where I live?

00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:15.960
Why are you helping me?

00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:18.440
And how do I know I can trust you?

00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:20.240
What if you’re some criminal

00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:23.320
trying to kidnap me
or sell me off to a brothel?

00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:25.320
Do I really look like someone who’d do that?

00:44:26.040 --> 00:44:27.400
I’ll explain later.

00:44:27.800 --> 00:44:29.320
For now, we have to run.

00:44:29.640 --> 00:44:32.520
If Kosol’s tiger picks up
our scent, we’re done.

00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:43.680
Just now, when you landed on me

00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:46.080
and shouted “A.H.W.”—

00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:48.720
What does that mean?

00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:50.680
Oh…

00:44:51.040 --> 00:44:52.240
It’s nothing.

00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:54.800
I was just… rambling.

00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:57.120
It just slipped out. Don’t mind it.

00:44:57.720 --> 00:44:59.200
Even if it slipped out,

00:44:59.480 --> 00:45:01.520
it must’ve meant something.

00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:05.280
Is it some kind of abbreviation
or secret code?

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:08.000
Well…

00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:10.760
It stands for…

00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:14.680
“Oh-ho, glasses.”

00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:16.840
Oh-ho, glasses.

00:45:17.800 --> 00:45:20.280
I saw your glasses
and it just came out.

00:45:20.320 --> 00:45:21.720
Total reflex.

00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:26.440
You’re the sun,

00:45:26.600 --> 00:45:28.080
I’m the moon,

00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:29.720
across the vast sky—

00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:31.840
in the light of day.

00:45:32.200 --> 00:45:34.880
I shine bright, you drift away.

00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:39.760
When I fade, then you appear
to light the night.

00:45:41.680 --> 00:45:43.320
It’s always been this way—

00:45:43.520 --> 00:45:45.200
never changing,

00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:47.200
endlessly repeating.

00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:51.200
Wow, that’s gorgeous.

00:45:51.280 --> 00:45:52.800
Whose poem is that?

00:45:54.240 --> 00:45:55.240
No one’s.

00:45:56.200 --> 00:45:57.200
Just...

00:45:58.120 --> 00:46:00.040
a little verse by a humble poet.

00:46:04.600 --> 00:46:05.600
Actually—

00:46:06.040 --> 00:46:08.240
I worked with your father for quite a while.

00:46:09.040 --> 00:46:10.880
You and I knew each other well.

00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:14.480
You really don’t remember anything about me?

00:46:17.120 --> 00:46:18.120
Really?

00:46:18.160 --> 00:46:21.240
We’ve known each other for that long?

00:46:22.640 --> 00:46:24.240
I’m sorry.

00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:26.080
I’m the worst.

00:46:26.120 --> 00:46:28.680
I drank some kind of poison—

00:46:28.720 --> 00:46:30.120
then I passed out.

00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:33.280
When I woke up, all my memories were gone.

00:46:36.440 --> 00:46:39.160
Do you remember why

00:46:39.640 --> 00:46:42.160
you took the poison in the first place?

00:46:43.840 --> 00:46:45.640
Jade told me—

00:46:45.680 --> 00:46:47.200
I was heartbroken.

00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:49.200
So I tried to end my life.

00:46:49.360 --> 00:46:51.120
And then some...

00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:52.920
Some official or something—

00:46:52.960 --> 00:46:56.000
found my body and brought it back home.

00:46:57.200 --> 00:46:59.320
That was Banjong.

00:46:59.720 --> 00:47:02.000
Yes, Banjong!

00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:04.560
How did you know?

00:47:05.520 --> 00:47:06.520
It was me.

00:47:07.040 --> 00:47:08.320
Banjong.

00:47:08.800 --> 00:47:10.640
Royal Scribe of Calligraphy.

00:47:11.240 --> 00:47:12.240
Whoa.

00:47:12.520 --> 00:47:14.800
So you were the one who found me.

00:47:14.840 --> 00:47:16.440
Then tell me—

00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:18.000
Worradej’s lover...

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:21.560
The one I was in love with—who was it?

00:47:21.560 --> 00:47:23.400
Who broke my heart?

00:47:25.160 --> 00:47:26.560
I really don’t know.

00:47:27.160 --> 00:47:29.280
All I know is you were devastated by love.

00:47:30.840 --> 00:47:32.280
Then tell me...

00:47:32.600 --> 00:47:34.400
Before I died,

00:47:36.760 --> 00:47:39.080
did I say anything? Any last words?

00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:42.320
When I found you...

00:47:44.040 --> 00:47:45.560
you were already gone.

00:47:48.320 --> 00:47:49.840
This sucks.

00:47:55.840 --> 00:47:57.080
Was it really true?

00:47:57.560 --> 00:48:00.200
Or do you actually know
more than you're letting on?

00:48:00.240 --> 00:48:02.000
And just not telling me?

00:48:04.560 --> 00:48:05.560
Come on—

00:48:06.560 --> 00:48:08.000
Why would I lie to you?

00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:13.040
Honestly...

00:48:13.480 --> 00:48:15.440
you don’t seem like the lying type.

00:48:15.720 --> 00:48:17.440
You’ve got this innocent face.

00:48:17.440 --> 00:48:18.960
I doubt you could fool anyone.

00:48:20.160 --> 00:48:22.200
But...

00:48:23.440 --> 00:48:25.760
seeing your face up close like this—

00:48:26.440 --> 00:48:28.040
your face is...

00:48:28.280 --> 00:48:29.960
seriously heaven-sent.

00:49:12.760 --> 00:49:16.320
Jade, do you know what kind
of relationship I had with Banjong?

00:49:16.320 --> 00:49:17.960
Total mess.

00:49:18.360 --> 00:49:21.080
That letter—Banjong definitely
wrote it for Worradej.

00:49:21.120 --> 00:49:23.520
Wait, do we have
two boyfriends now, Worradej?

00:49:23.560 --> 00:49:25.080
While I’m on the run—

00:49:25.240 --> 00:49:27.040
you’ll have to stay here as my hostage.

00:49:27.080 --> 00:49:29.680
Kosol, isn’t he adorable?

00:49:29.680 --> 00:49:31.400
Can I keep him?

00:49:33.200 --> 00:49:35.240
You're always forcing people
to do what you want.

00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:37.240
You think the whole world
revolves around you or what?

00:49:39.520 --> 00:49:41.480
What just hit my leg?

00:49:42.440 --> 00:49:44.000
That’s my giant snakehead fish.

00:49:44.360 --> 00:49:45.360
Kosol.

00:49:45.640 --> 00:49:48.200
Can I play with the baby for a bit?

00:49:48.480 --> 00:49:49.720
Wait… is that a person’s name?

00:49:49.760 --> 00:49:50.960
(Probably, Mom.)

00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:52.040
What the—

00:49:52.040 --> 00:49:53.800
- Why didn’t you say anything?
- Why didn’t you?

00:49:53.800 --> 00:49:55.920
(I thought you were asking him.)

00:49:59.320 --> 00:50:01.640
That scared me for real.

00:50:02.200 --> 00:50:04.480
- Just stay still for a sec.
- Stay still, baby.

00:50:05.880 --> 00:50:07.680
I’ll help you get your memory back.

00:50:08.680 --> 00:50:10.280
Take it slow.
(This is off-script.)

00:50:10.280 --> 00:50:12.160
(This is off-script.)

00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:13.520
Why are you using that big fan?

00:50:13.560 --> 00:50:14.600
The small one would’ve worked.

00:50:14.600 --> 00:50:16.360
- But I’m hot.
- I’m hot too.

00:50:17.040 --> 00:50:18.760
I’m the hottest of all.
