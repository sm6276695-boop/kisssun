YOU AND EVERYTHING ELSE

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:01.186
She's the unresponsive patient
we called about.

00:01:02.062 --> 00:01:04.189
Vitals are stable,
except for low oxygen at 91.

00:01:04.272 --> 00:01:05.690
Her mental status is unchanged…

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.754
Fortunately, she's in the clear for now,
but this could happen again at any time.

00:01:28.505 --> 00:01:29.547
At this point,

00:01:29.631 --> 00:01:32.425
she's beyond the stage
where treatment would be effective,

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:34.052
let alone lead to a full recovery.

00:01:34.928 --> 00:01:38.431
In my medical opinion,
there is no chance of recovery.

00:01:39.265 --> 00:01:42.352
And the patient herself
does not want any further treatment.

00:01:47.023 --> 00:01:48.566
I felt helpless.

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:04.207
Sang-yeon.

00:02:39.492 --> 00:02:40.493
Stay here.

00:02:53.965 --> 00:02:56.259
Then I'll stay by your side.

00:03:15.528 --> 00:03:16.362
Yeah.

00:03:19.616 --> 00:03:20.742
Okay.

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:00.156
Everything's so different.
I can't tell where anything is anymore.

00:04:02.242 --> 00:04:05.119
It's still the ocean,
which means she'll know you're here.

00:04:06.496 --> 00:04:07.538
You think so?

00:04:21.511 --> 00:04:23.471
That was so typical of me earlier.

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:28.935
When we were struggling
to find Mom's spot.

00:04:29.936 --> 00:04:33.648
It's been 20 years, but I thought
I'd recognize it at a glance.

00:04:38.361 --> 00:04:39.821
I'm always like this.

00:04:42.782 --> 00:04:45.910
I'm the one who insists on walking away,

00:04:46.744 --> 00:04:48.997
but I expect everyone to be
where I left them.

00:04:53.084 --> 00:04:56.170
Still, I'm sure she's pleased
that I came with you.

00:05:00.049 --> 00:05:02.093
She'd be pleased that you're here,

00:05:02.176 --> 00:05:04.053
not because you came with me.

00:05:11.227 --> 00:05:13.771
Did you really think
she loved me more than you?

00:05:18.443 --> 00:05:19.485
Yes.

00:05:19.986 --> 00:05:22.071
How could you ever think that?

00:05:24.407 --> 00:05:27.076
It's not a question
of how I could think that.

00:05:28.661 --> 00:05:31.581
When such thoughts
settle in a child's mind…

00:05:33.583 --> 00:05:35.752
it shapes their entire world.

00:05:48.806 --> 00:05:50.058
You're right.

00:05:56.064 --> 00:05:57.357
It really does.

00:06:01.652 --> 00:06:03.613
Why did you change your mind?

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:16.209
I don't know either.

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:21.464
I never wanted to see you again…

00:06:25.176 --> 00:06:27.720
but I guess you have a strange hold on me.

00:06:34.852 --> 00:06:35.937
I'm sorry.

00:06:37.397 --> 00:06:39.232
I'm sorry for everything.

00:06:47.073 --> 00:06:48.074
Okay.

00:06:53.204 --> 00:06:54.914
I have something to give you.

00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:58.501
What is it?

00:07:03.756 --> 00:07:05.299
I'm finally returning it to you.

00:07:14.183 --> 00:07:16.352
How do you still have this?

00:07:19.856 --> 00:07:21.774
Because I'm spiteful and wicked.

00:07:24.444 --> 00:07:27.572
I refused to sell it
even when I was cold and hungry.

00:07:28.364 --> 00:07:30.491
And now I finally get to return it to you.

00:07:33.536 --> 00:07:34.370
But…

00:07:36.581 --> 00:07:38.207
are you sure I should have this?

00:07:38.291 --> 00:07:40.126
It was yours to begin with.

00:07:40.209 --> 00:07:41.752
My brother's gift to you.

00:07:43.045 --> 00:07:45.798
And who else should have it if not you?

00:07:47.675 --> 00:07:50.344
The joy it brought my brother

00:07:51.137 --> 00:07:55.057
and the comfort I felt knowing
that I've held onto it all these years…

00:07:55.641 --> 00:07:57.268
You're the only one who gets it.

00:08:04.775 --> 00:08:05.776
Thanks.

00:08:08.696 --> 00:08:10.072
I'll have this, then.

00:08:14.952 --> 00:08:16.370
I need to switch out my patch.

00:08:21.626 --> 00:08:22.543
I'll take that.

00:08:44.148 --> 00:08:46.901
Don't you have work? I know you're busy.

00:08:47.652 --> 00:08:49.403
We're securing
the source material license,

00:08:49.487 --> 00:08:50.571
so I'm good for now.

00:08:51.322 --> 00:08:53.616
Yay! Lucky me.

00:08:54.242 --> 00:08:55.868
I'm ill at the perfect time.

00:08:56.786 --> 00:08:57.620
Hey.

00:08:58.704 --> 00:09:00.873
I'm just happy, that's all.

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:06.587
Are you sure that you don't want it?

00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:09.257
The building in Seongsu.

00:09:10.716 --> 00:09:13.052
Yes, I don't need it.

00:09:15.263 --> 00:09:16.806
I have no one else to give it to.

00:09:19.225 --> 00:09:20.560
How futile.

00:09:21.978 --> 00:09:24.063
That's all that will be left of me.

00:09:29.527 --> 00:09:31.571
That's not true.

00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:35.366
You produced 11 films, remember?

00:09:39.412 --> 00:09:41.163
You'll come again tomorrow, right?

00:09:55.094 --> 00:09:56.262
When are you coming?

00:10:09.817 --> 00:10:11.652
Is this really Mrs. Jang's broth?

00:10:12.987 --> 00:10:16.198
The dough is also your favorite.
It was made by my mom.

00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:20.870
Eat up.

00:10:21.370 --> 00:10:24.540
So I can finally stop hearing about
you craving hand-torn noodles.

00:10:39.555 --> 00:10:40.473
Are you okay?

00:10:46.103 --> 00:10:47.355
Sang-yeon told me

00:10:48.773 --> 00:10:50.941
that this happened all the time.

00:11:12.171 --> 00:11:13.255
What is this?

00:11:13.339 --> 00:11:15.925
INTERNET EXPLORER IS NOT RESPONDING

00:11:17.134 --> 00:11:17.968
What the…

00:11:18.636 --> 00:11:19.762
This is bad.

00:11:21.389 --> 00:11:22.765
Is something not working?

00:11:24.642 --> 00:11:26.560
Gosh, that's a relief.

00:11:27.061 --> 00:11:28.437
I only lost ten lines.

00:11:28.938 --> 00:11:29.772
What is it?

00:11:30.523 --> 00:11:31.607
Just some simple stuff.

00:11:32.108 --> 00:11:35.319
The original author wants to know
how their work will be adapted.

00:11:36.404 --> 00:11:37.446
Good luck.

00:12:18.988 --> 00:12:19.989
Are you done?

00:12:27.455 --> 00:12:29.123
What was that just now?

00:12:32.668 --> 00:12:36.046
What do they mean
about two people being prepared

00:12:36.547 --> 00:12:38.048
to accompany you as requested?

00:12:44.513 --> 00:12:46.682
-Eun-jung.
-You said you wouldn't go.

00:12:47.475 --> 00:12:48.434
To Switzerland.

00:12:55.399 --> 00:12:57.151
You don't have to go.

00:13:02.323 --> 00:13:03.741
But you will?

00:13:12.416 --> 00:13:14.293
I'm sorry for not telling you.

00:13:18.589 --> 00:13:19.548
But…

00:13:22.051 --> 00:13:23.761
I'm in so much pain.

00:13:27.598 --> 00:13:28.891
You still have time.

00:13:30.476 --> 00:13:32.812
You can still talk and walk.

00:13:33.687 --> 00:13:34.980
You're still breathing--

00:13:35.064 --> 00:13:37.066
That's precisely why I want to go now,

00:13:37.566 --> 00:13:38.776
while I'm still

00:13:40.236 --> 00:13:41.612
myself.

00:13:53.207 --> 00:13:54.750
You said that if I stayed,

00:13:56.335 --> 00:13:59.255
you would stay by my side
until the very end, didn't you?

00:14:02.633 --> 00:14:05.427
I know that you will do just that.

00:14:08.514 --> 00:14:09.598
But…

00:14:12.893 --> 00:14:15.062
I can't ask that of you.

00:14:19.567 --> 00:14:21.277
When my mom was dying…

00:14:25.364 --> 00:14:28.367
I witnessed the lowest depths of pain.

00:14:34.748 --> 00:14:39.086
The feeling of helplessly watching,
knowing that your hands are tied…

00:14:45.467 --> 00:14:46.844
I know it all too well.

00:14:53.017 --> 00:14:54.268
Still, stay.

00:14:57.813 --> 00:14:58.814
No.

00:15:14.747 --> 00:15:15.748
Eun-jung.

00:15:20.252 --> 00:15:21.670
I'm going to die.

00:15:27.009 --> 00:15:29.970
It was hard for me
to come to terms with that too.

00:15:33.015 --> 00:15:34.600
Of course I want to live.

00:15:37.561 --> 00:15:40.230
If there were even
a 1% chance of surviving,

00:15:41.690 --> 00:15:44.276
I would have been willing to try anything.

00:15:46.236 --> 00:15:47.780
But there isn't.

00:15:51.575 --> 00:15:52.493
Sang-yeon…

00:15:52.576 --> 00:15:54.036
The thing about hope…

00:15:57.873 --> 00:16:00.084
is that it drains the life out of you.

00:16:04.505 --> 00:16:06.215
I want to end this suffering

00:16:08.050 --> 00:16:11.053
while I am still
holding onto my sense of self.

00:16:11.845 --> 00:16:15.265
Is that so wrong and selfish a thing
to ask for?

00:16:20.521 --> 00:16:24.066
At the very least, shouldn't I have
the right to end this pain?

00:16:35.536 --> 00:16:36.996
There, all fixed.

00:16:45.546 --> 00:16:46.505
Did you send it?

00:16:47.006 --> 00:16:48.132
Yes. Did you fix it?

00:16:49.008 --> 00:16:50.467
You sure are impressive.

00:16:50.551 --> 00:16:53.429
Please, I just removed
a couple of antivirus programs.

00:16:53.512 --> 00:16:54.722
Do you want a beer?

00:16:55.431 --> 00:16:56.515
Is Ha-yun asleep?

00:16:56.598 --> 00:16:59.101
Yes, and my husband's coming home late.

00:16:59.184 --> 00:17:00.644
What a treat.

00:17:02.730 --> 00:17:04.440
Are you starting a new series?

00:17:04.523 --> 00:17:05.357
Yes.

00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:07.776
Congratulations.

00:17:08.402 --> 00:17:09.528
It's finally happening.

00:17:12.781 --> 00:17:13.949
But why the long face?

00:17:15.534 --> 00:17:16.785
Did something happen?

00:17:20.956 --> 00:17:22.291
You can't go.

00:17:23.125 --> 00:17:25.294
Do you really think you could handle it?

00:17:30.883 --> 00:17:32.968
I can't think properly.

00:17:33.677 --> 00:17:35.262
Everything feels so surreal.

00:17:35.345 --> 00:17:38.057
Is she out of her mind,
asking you for something like this?

00:17:40.267 --> 00:17:42.728
She says I don't need to go with her.

00:17:43.228 --> 00:17:44.188
You're kidding.

00:17:44.688 --> 00:17:47.608
Then why did she mention it to you
in the first place?

00:17:47.691 --> 00:17:49.318
What does she expect from you?

00:17:50.569 --> 00:17:52.154
If I felt like…

00:17:57.117 --> 00:17:58.577
I was slowly losing

00:17:59.703 --> 00:18:01.747
my sense of self…

00:18:12.299 --> 00:18:14.927
I think I would want to leave as well.

00:18:19.848 --> 00:18:21.016
So would I.

00:18:21.809 --> 00:18:25.646
If I were in her position,
I might have had those thoughts too.

00:18:27.397 --> 00:18:29.149
But this isn't your burden to bear.

00:18:29.733 --> 00:18:31.735
You'd be tied to someone else's death.

00:18:34.071 --> 00:18:37.491
Take me, for example.
It's been six years since my dad passed,

00:18:37.991 --> 00:18:39.660
but even to this day,

00:18:39.743 --> 00:18:43.664
I still haven't gotten over our decision
to take him off life support.

00:18:46.083 --> 00:18:48.544
It's too agonizing to even think about.

00:18:50.254 --> 00:18:52.923
Do you understand
what you're considering doing here?

00:18:53.674 --> 00:18:57.136
This could haunt you forever,
especially someone like you.

00:19:52.608 --> 00:19:53.984
I read

00:19:55.611 --> 00:19:57.279
that only a few follow through

00:19:58.447 --> 00:20:00.866
when faced with the moment of truth.

00:20:03.744 --> 00:20:07.748
For some, leaving is surprisingly easy.

00:20:09.708 --> 00:20:11.210
While others

00:20:12.377 --> 00:20:14.129
stop midway

00:20:14.838 --> 00:20:15.964
and live on for weeks,

00:20:16.965 --> 00:20:17.966
even months.

00:20:18.634 --> 00:20:20.052
SWITZERLAND ASSISTED DYING

00:20:20.135 --> 00:20:22.137
Some even live on for several years.

00:20:22.221 --> 00:20:25.224
10 KOREANS DIE BY ASSISTED SUICIDE
IN SWITZERLAND

00:20:25.307 --> 00:20:28.060
Those people discover new ways
to face their pain

00:20:29.770 --> 00:20:31.855
that help them cope.

00:20:36.026 --> 00:20:37.694
Knowing that there is a way out…

00:20:37.778 --> 00:20:39.279
TO LIVE WITH DIGNITY
TO DIE WITH DIGNITY

00:20:40.113 --> 00:20:42.908
…can ease people of the pressure

00:20:44.451 --> 00:20:46.828
of having to end their suffering.

00:20:53.210 --> 00:20:56.171
As for which side Sang-yeon would be on,

00:20:57.339 --> 00:21:00.133
I can't say for certain.

00:21:02.177 --> 00:21:03.178
No.

00:21:04.638 --> 00:21:05.681
Perhaps

00:21:06.765 --> 00:21:08.934
I already know the answer.

00:21:11.103 --> 00:21:13.272
Maybe that's why I feel so anxious.

00:21:19.319 --> 00:21:20.362
But still…

00:21:22.864 --> 00:21:24.783
I don't think I can

00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:27.077
let you go alone.

00:21:28.578 --> 00:21:29.871
For the flights…

00:21:32.207 --> 00:21:34.042
we're getting round-trip tickets.

00:21:35.877 --> 00:21:38.046
For both of us.

00:21:48.307 --> 00:21:49.641
If you really

00:21:50.851 --> 00:21:52.811
end up coming with me…

00:21:56.189 --> 00:21:59.026
let's leave as though
we're going on a real trip.

00:22:01.111 --> 00:22:02.362
Smiling and all.

00:22:06.992 --> 00:22:10.162
We never got the chance…

00:22:13.498 --> 00:22:16.501
to go on a trip together.

00:22:20.756 --> 00:22:22.716
But don't ever forget this.

00:22:23.967 --> 00:22:25.093
Until the very end…

00:22:27.429 --> 00:22:29.639
I will keep hoping for us
to return together.

00:22:32.476 --> 00:22:34.227
You know what a trip is, right?

00:22:36.730 --> 00:22:38.065
You leave

00:22:39.107 --> 00:22:40.525
and then come back home.

00:23:01.213 --> 00:23:03.298
I never imagined it would be this hard.

00:23:08.970 --> 00:23:10.806
That it would be this terrifying.

00:23:15.644 --> 00:23:18.438
I hadn't fully comprehended
what it meant to be going there.

00:23:23.527 --> 00:23:24.986
How afraid

00:23:26.405 --> 00:23:27.906
and terrified I would be.

00:23:31.243 --> 00:23:33.328
Only after I had made the choice to go…

00:23:35.622 --> 00:23:36.832
did I realize.

00:24:09.072 --> 00:24:10.323
I wonder if those people…

00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:15.662
have found their answers.

00:24:27.048 --> 00:24:29.885
I packed some pickled cucumbers
and a little bit of everything.

00:24:30.927 --> 00:24:33.346
Will she call you old-fashioned
if you take this?

00:24:34.848 --> 00:24:36.391
No, she'll love them.

00:24:36.975 --> 00:24:39.352
Does Producer Choi like Korean food too?

00:24:39.436 --> 00:24:40.270
Yes.

00:24:40.770 --> 00:24:42.481
So the flight's tomorrow at 12:00?

00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:44.816
It's 12:20 p.m.

00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:45.775
I see.

00:24:45.859 --> 00:24:49.070
Well then, you should leave
by 10:30 at the latest.

00:24:53.825 --> 00:24:54.826
Mom.

00:24:57.287 --> 00:24:58.914
When Dad got into that accident,

00:25:00.707 --> 00:25:02.417
how did you manage?

00:25:04.127 --> 00:25:07.088
What sort of silly question is that?

00:25:07.172 --> 00:25:10.175
He left for work with a smile,
just like any other day,

00:25:10.258 --> 00:25:12.844
and less than an hour later,
you saw him like that.

00:25:15.430 --> 00:25:17.349
Weren't you scared at all?

00:25:18.016 --> 00:25:19.726
When you first saw him like that.

00:25:20.810 --> 00:25:24.064
I wasn't scared, so to speak,
maybe because he was my husband.

00:25:24.648 --> 00:25:25.941
I was dumbfounded though.

00:25:27.234 --> 00:25:30.487
When something like that happens,
your mind goes blank.

00:25:31.488 --> 00:25:32.572
You get through it

00:25:33.198 --> 00:25:35.075
because it happens to you.

00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:38.036
I didn't have a choice.

00:25:41.498 --> 00:25:44.376
There were preparations
I still needed to make.

00:25:47.629 --> 00:25:49.714
There was a chance that I might be alone.

00:25:52.801 --> 00:25:53.969
I still needed…

00:25:55.845 --> 00:25:56.930
to brace myself

00:25:57.514 --> 00:26:00.100
for the possibility
that I would be returning alone.

00:26:34.843 --> 00:26:37.178
EUN-JUNG

00:26:43.768 --> 00:26:47.522
Attention, please.
Passengers for Korean Air Flight 917

00:26:47.606 --> 00:26:52.027
departing for Switzerland,
boarding will begin shortly.

00:26:52.110 --> 00:26:55.322
Please proceed to the departure gates
as soon as possible.

00:27:18.219 --> 00:27:21.139
I know there is no right answer.

00:27:23.350 --> 00:27:24.392
Even so,

00:27:25.769 --> 00:27:27.479
I will choose

00:27:27.562 --> 00:27:29.147
to spend this time with you.

00:28:26.913 --> 00:28:29.040
Wow, it's a river view.

00:28:29.916 --> 00:28:32.293
I didn't know they had a river in Zurich.

00:28:34.546 --> 00:28:36.089
My goodness.

00:28:36.589 --> 00:28:38.258
You didn't even look it up?

00:28:39.968 --> 00:28:42.887
Come on, this is the Limmat River.

00:28:42.971 --> 00:28:44.681
I like it more because it's a surprise.

00:29:06.202 --> 00:29:07.078
It's a crane.

00:29:10.206 --> 00:29:11.332
How random.

00:29:12.834 --> 00:29:13.918
You're right.

00:29:17.088 --> 00:29:19.466
I've never stayed in a suite before.

00:29:20.675 --> 00:29:22.594
Way to go, Eun-jung.

00:29:23.845 --> 00:29:25.221
You lost the chance

00:29:26.014 --> 00:29:27.432
to own a building.

00:29:27.932 --> 00:29:30.018
I'm getting to stay in a suite, aren't I?

00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:34.773
Sang-yeon, look here.

00:29:34.856 --> 00:29:38.067
-These rooms seem to be connected.
-Yes?

00:29:38.151 --> 00:29:39.068
Oh really?

00:30:06.304 --> 00:30:08.515
It was set to happen four days later.

00:30:10.517 --> 00:30:11.976
Before then,

00:30:12.060 --> 00:30:14.562
Sang-yeon needed to have
two medical interviews.

00:30:16.147 --> 00:30:20.610
Sang-yeon was free to schedule
the first interview whenever she liked,

00:30:21.528 --> 00:30:25.490
but the second one had to be scheduled
for the night before.

00:30:26.366 --> 00:30:27.742
For the final time…

00:30:29.953 --> 00:30:32.997
the doctor would make sure
she hadn't changed her mind.

00:30:43.716 --> 00:30:44.843
It's another crane.

00:30:46.845 --> 00:30:47.720
Did you know?

00:30:48.221 --> 00:30:50.640
I'm a swallow, and my brother's a crane.

00:30:52.559 --> 00:30:54.644
The "hak" in your brother's name
means "crane"?

00:30:54.727 --> 00:30:57.105
Yes, Cheon Sang-hak.

00:30:57.981 --> 00:30:59.107
Your first love.

00:31:02.944 --> 00:31:05.071
"This short middle school kid would,

00:31:05.154 --> 00:31:07.699
three years later, become my first love."

00:31:10.201 --> 00:31:12.161
Hey, do you have a death wish?

00:31:18.126 --> 00:31:19.669
Jeez, you scaredy-cat.

00:31:29.888 --> 00:31:32.056
How did you decide to get married?

00:31:36.978 --> 00:31:39.314
I got a divorce three years ago.

00:31:40.982 --> 00:31:41.983
I heard.

00:31:43.109 --> 00:31:44.027
But

00:31:44.569 --> 00:31:49.616
I was more shocked to hear about
your marriage than your divorce.

00:31:50.742 --> 00:31:52.452
How did it happen so quickly?

00:31:53.202 --> 00:31:54.704
And why with Han Jae-jun?

00:31:58.833 --> 00:32:01.127
He was successful, had a lot of money,

00:32:01.836 --> 00:32:03.046
and liked me.

00:32:05.298 --> 00:32:08.509
But there were so many other guys
that liked you.

00:32:08.593 --> 00:32:10.219
He liked me more.

00:32:10.303 --> 00:32:11.930
He was really into me.

00:32:12.805 --> 00:32:16.184
Plus, there was a strangely
innocent side to him

00:32:16.267 --> 00:32:20.939
that made me believe
he would cherish me for a lifetime.

00:32:21.606 --> 00:32:22.690
How wrong I was.

00:32:23.608 --> 00:32:25.818
He wanted to split
within a year of our marriage.

00:32:27.362 --> 00:32:30.740
He said he'd never felt
so much as a hint of warmth from me.

00:32:32.867 --> 00:32:34.285
You sort of get that, right?

00:32:37.163 --> 00:32:38.498
So from that moment on,

00:32:38.581 --> 00:32:42.502
I poured every ounce of effort I had
into our relationship.

00:32:43.419 --> 00:32:48.758
I knew it was all a facade,
but I kept up the act for six long years.

00:32:52.595 --> 00:32:54.263
Why did you try so hard?

00:32:56.307 --> 00:32:57.141
"Who would

00:32:58.518 --> 00:33:00.186
accept you in the end?"

00:33:05.566 --> 00:33:06.943
Those words

00:33:08.194 --> 00:33:10.863
haunted me all throughout my thirties

00:33:11.864 --> 00:33:13.908
like an unshakable curse.

00:33:18.454 --> 00:33:20.123
I needed to prove you wrong.

00:33:20.206 --> 00:33:23.668
That I had been accepted by someone

00:33:24.293 --> 00:33:26.170
and that I was being loved.

00:33:30.883 --> 00:33:33.302
Then I became fixated
on the idea of having a child.

00:33:33.886 --> 00:33:35.805
If I had a child,

00:33:35.888 --> 00:33:40.018
I was confident
that I could become a good mother.

00:33:40.852 --> 00:33:42.186
But it never happened.

00:33:43.646 --> 00:33:45.356
Then came the cancer.

00:33:54.657 --> 00:33:55.658
Hey.

00:33:56.492 --> 00:33:58.911
You don't have to get so upset.

00:34:00.788 --> 00:34:03.708
I'm simply being honest with you.

00:34:10.548 --> 00:34:12.133
Did you pack warm clothes?

00:34:14.761 --> 00:34:16.763
I asked for the rental car
to come a little earlier.

00:34:24.979 --> 00:34:27.732
It really felt like we were on a trip.

00:34:27.815 --> 00:34:29.942
Whoa, look at the sky.

00:34:31.402 --> 00:34:35.364
Do you finally get why people rave about
how amazing Switzerland is?

00:34:37.450 --> 00:34:39.077
It's straight out of a postcard.

00:34:45.208 --> 00:34:47.502
Sang-yeon told me that, at some point,

00:34:48.211 --> 00:34:51.297
she had developed a new habit
of saying goodbye to everything.

00:34:53.091 --> 00:34:54.425
Because every moment

00:34:55.093 --> 00:34:56.177
felt so precious.

00:35:28.167 --> 00:35:30.253
I can't believe
I'm seeing the Alps with you.

00:35:33.673 --> 00:35:35.591
From now on, when we think of Switzerland,

00:35:36.467 --> 00:35:37.593
let's think of the Alps.

00:35:40.930 --> 00:35:44.267
Let this moment be
how we remember Switzerland.

00:35:47.186 --> 00:35:48.146
Okay.

00:35:52.275 --> 00:35:53.442
Let's take a photo.

00:35:59.157 --> 00:36:00.700
I can't say no to a selfie.

00:36:05.371 --> 00:36:06.372
Ta-da!

00:36:08.374 --> 00:36:10.293
-You packed this yourself?
-Yes.

00:37:00.593 --> 00:37:01.594
Suddenly,

00:37:02.136 --> 00:37:05.097
I felt a sense of relief.

00:37:09.310 --> 00:37:10.436
I'm so glad.

00:37:11.062 --> 00:37:11.896
What?

00:37:13.356 --> 00:37:14.732
That I came here with you.

00:37:19.237 --> 00:37:22.448
So there's no reason for you
to bear any guilt, okay?

00:37:24.867 --> 00:37:26.035
You really can't.

00:37:27.495 --> 00:37:29.664
My therapist told me this once.

00:37:30.706 --> 00:37:31.916
Guilt is…

00:37:34.126 --> 00:37:36.545
a deep and relentless emotion.

00:37:38.214 --> 00:37:40.800
So when the pain is unbearable,

00:37:40.883 --> 00:37:43.261
some people end up
inventing their own guilt.

00:37:49.267 --> 00:37:52.270
No matter how hard I tried,
I couldn't go to sleep.

00:37:53.813 --> 00:37:55.273
Sang-yeon's words

00:37:56.565 --> 00:37:57.817
lingered in my mind.

00:38:00.361 --> 00:38:02.071
Had the pain been so unbearable

00:38:02.947 --> 00:38:05.449
for Sang-yeon over the years

00:38:05.950 --> 00:38:09.412
that she had created
her own feelings of guilt?

00:38:59.337 --> 00:39:00.463
Are you feeling okay?

00:39:03.382 --> 00:39:04.216
Yes.

00:39:06.469 --> 00:39:07.845
I'm feeling good today.

00:39:09.764 --> 00:39:11.515
My head barely aches at all.

00:39:14.977 --> 00:39:16.270
Yesterday was tough, wasn't it?

00:39:21.275 --> 00:39:22.568
What should we do today?

00:39:23.319 --> 00:39:24.695
Should we go over there?

00:39:24.779 --> 00:39:27.990
I heard that Chagall designed
the stained-glass windows in that church.

00:39:29.700 --> 00:39:30.868
Let's go scouting.

00:39:32.745 --> 00:39:33.579
"Scouting"?

00:39:35.831 --> 00:39:37.124
To the blue house.

00:39:43.714 --> 00:39:44.965
That was the place

00:39:46.384 --> 00:39:50.096
where Sang-yeon was intending
to end her life.

00:40:22.086 --> 00:40:23.921
Both Sang-yeon and I

00:40:25.714 --> 00:40:27.883
could feel that something was coming.

00:40:33.097 --> 00:40:34.598
All I could do

00:40:35.891 --> 00:40:37.518
was to hope for Sang-yeon

00:40:38.018 --> 00:40:40.104
to have a change of heart.

00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:34.074
Ta-da!

00:41:38.787 --> 00:41:39.747
What do you think?

00:41:45.836 --> 00:41:47.129
Is my dress prettier?

00:41:51.342 --> 00:41:52.468
They're both pretty.

00:41:53.761 --> 00:41:54.845
Let's try them on.

00:41:59.850 --> 00:42:01.268
Are you sure you're all right?

00:42:03.270 --> 00:42:05.064
You were shaking back there.

00:42:10.986 --> 00:42:12.738
I was nervous, of course.

00:42:16.033 --> 00:42:17.576
It was so scary,

00:42:18.661 --> 00:42:20.412
to see that blue door.

00:42:25.793 --> 00:42:29.129
It felt as though
I was looking at the Iguazu Falls.

00:42:29.755 --> 00:42:33.092
It's the most powerful thing
I've ever seen in my life.

00:42:35.386 --> 00:42:37.346
When I saw the Iguazu Falls…

00:42:39.557 --> 00:42:41.100
I was completely overwhelmed.

00:42:41.892 --> 00:42:44.603
I felt scared it would swallow me whole.

00:42:45.688 --> 00:42:47.648
Yet, rather than feel repelled by it,

00:42:48.566 --> 00:42:49.817
I thought, "Oh,

00:42:51.277 --> 00:42:53.028
"I am really here."

00:42:55.239 --> 00:42:58.242
"I am actually seeing this."
And I thought,

00:42:59.618 --> 00:43:00.995
"There, I'm satisfied."

00:43:02.204 --> 00:43:03.998
A hush settled over me.

00:43:14.508 --> 00:43:16.302
I'm so happy right now

00:43:18.012 --> 00:43:19.722
because I get to be here with you.

00:43:25.144 --> 00:43:27.646
In moments when I was writhing in pain,

00:43:28.647 --> 00:43:29.481
I could only see

00:43:30.899 --> 00:43:33.068
two kinds of death before me.

00:43:36.530 --> 00:43:38.282
A death like my mom's…

00:43:42.328 --> 00:43:43.871
or a death like my brother's.

00:43:47.333 --> 00:43:50.836
But when I found out
about this place in Switzerland,

00:43:50.919 --> 00:43:52.588
I felt so comforted.

00:43:55.007 --> 00:43:57.426
I couldn't stop thinking about my brother.

00:44:00.304 --> 00:44:02.348
If he had to go through with that…

00:44:05.893 --> 00:44:08.562
if his life was fated to end like that…

00:44:12.274 --> 00:44:16.070
it would have been nice
if he'd had a Switzerland of his own.

00:44:19.573 --> 00:44:22.117
It would have been nice
if my mom had one too.

00:44:25.454 --> 00:44:26.580
If I only could,

00:44:27.581 --> 00:44:30.417
I would have held their hands
and gone with them.

00:44:38.384 --> 00:44:40.010
But here I am.

00:44:42.971 --> 00:44:45.182
I'm neither up in the cold mountains

00:44:46.308 --> 00:44:48.644
nor completely shattered by pain.

00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:54.316
Nor am I alone,
because you're here with me.

00:45:00.072 --> 00:45:00.989
Eun-jung.

00:45:03.117 --> 00:45:05.744
Nobody could face their death

00:45:06.745 --> 00:45:08.038
as happily as I am.

00:45:11.083 --> 00:45:12.292
That's why I hope…

00:45:14.545 --> 00:45:16.213
we can spend our last night…

00:45:18.882 --> 00:45:20.300
laughing.

00:46:10.934 --> 00:46:13.228
I really don't want
to fall asleep tonight.

00:46:15.522 --> 00:46:16.523
Me neither.

00:46:18.025 --> 00:46:19.276
Let's stay awake.

00:46:21.236 --> 00:46:23.363
I'm totally going to stay awake.

00:46:26.575 --> 00:46:28.744
I'm going to watch the sunrise tomorrow.

00:46:30.496 --> 00:46:32.122
I should say goodbye

00:46:32.748 --> 00:46:34.082
to my last sunrise.

00:46:40.088 --> 00:46:42.049
Let's set five alarms.

00:46:45.260 --> 00:46:46.178
No.

00:46:46.887 --> 00:46:47.721
How about ten?

00:46:54.394 --> 00:46:55.229
I have…

00:46:57.523 --> 00:46:59.233
you to thank for everything.

00:47:00.317 --> 00:47:01.318
How so?

00:47:04.112 --> 00:47:05.405
When I was younger,

00:47:06.824 --> 00:47:08.909
you got me into reading books…

00:47:11.161 --> 00:47:13.497
and sparked my interest in films.

00:47:15.541 --> 00:47:19.086
How I quit university and majored in film…

00:47:21.088 --> 00:47:22.881
Why I ultimately left my job

00:47:23.382 --> 00:47:25.259
to write screenplays for TV series…

00:47:27.469 --> 00:47:30.013
I owe everything to you.

00:47:33.141 --> 00:47:34.142
No way.

00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:38.230
So I practically created you.

00:47:38.730 --> 00:47:42.067
Exactly. I find it absurd too.

00:47:46.321 --> 00:47:47.614
It's the same for me.

00:47:50.742 --> 00:47:53.287
I went offtrack because of you…

00:47:55.330 --> 00:47:57.165
and I became wealthy

00:47:58.375 --> 00:48:00.002
by stealing what was yours.

00:48:03.297 --> 00:48:04.840
I even got married…

00:48:07.342 --> 00:48:08.844
due to your curse.

00:48:12.848 --> 00:48:14.182
I mean it.

00:48:15.517 --> 00:48:17.019
There's truly no one else

00:48:18.437 --> 00:48:19.771
like you.

00:48:24.151 --> 00:48:26.403
You're the only one like you as well.

00:48:35.954 --> 00:48:37.456
I wonder why I acted that way.

00:48:42.669 --> 00:48:45.213
You were the only friend I had.

00:48:48.425 --> 00:48:50.093
I wonder why I let myself…

00:48:52.054 --> 00:48:52.971
lose you.

00:48:55.265 --> 00:48:56.224
But in the end,

00:48:57.225 --> 00:48:58.769
you found me again.

00:49:01.146 --> 00:49:02.105
I did?

00:49:04.441 --> 00:49:05.525
Of course.

00:49:09.905 --> 00:49:12.157
Will you miss me too?

00:49:21.291 --> 00:49:24.544
Of course I'll miss you.

00:49:41.687 --> 00:49:43.772
So you have accepted me…

00:49:47.401 --> 00:49:48.402
in the end.

00:49:50.487 --> 00:49:51.405
You have.

00:49:57.953 --> 00:50:00.247
I think my mom would be so happy…

00:50:02.290 --> 00:50:03.583
to see me here with you.

00:50:09.297 --> 00:50:10.132
Yes.

00:50:15.846 --> 00:50:17.305
She would hug me, right?

00:50:21.685 --> 00:50:22.686
Of course.

00:52:12.420 --> 00:52:14.005
Sang-yeon…

00:52:47.956 --> 00:52:48.957
Eun-jung.

00:52:51.334 --> 00:52:52.169
Yeah?

00:52:53.086 --> 00:52:53.920
What is it?

00:53:10.729 --> 00:53:11.855
How beautiful.

00:53:13.273 --> 00:53:14.274
Yeah.

00:53:19.738 --> 00:53:22.157
Still, I wish we were back in Korea.

00:53:24.868 --> 00:53:26.453
It would have been nice

00:53:27.621 --> 00:53:29.539
to see my last sunrise there.

00:53:43.094 --> 00:53:44.095
Eun-jung.

00:53:45.096 --> 00:53:46.097
Come here.

00:54:01.404 --> 00:54:02.405
What is this?

00:54:07.911 --> 00:54:09.162
The key

00:54:09.871 --> 00:54:11.665
to the top drawer of my desk.

00:54:13.792 --> 00:54:15.126
If you look in there,

00:54:16.544 --> 00:54:18.004
you'll find my diary.

00:54:21.216 --> 00:54:22.634
Use it however you like.

00:54:25.553 --> 00:54:26.846
It was great.

00:54:28.223 --> 00:54:29.683
The story you wrote about us.

00:54:34.938 --> 00:54:36.982
If you finish writing that…

00:54:40.068 --> 00:54:41.278
it would be as though…

00:54:43.280 --> 00:54:45.282
I am living on in your story forever.

00:54:48.285 --> 00:54:49.286
And

00:54:51.079 --> 00:54:52.914
let's just say our farewells here.

00:54:55.709 --> 00:54:57.002
Thank you for everything.

00:54:58.837 --> 00:54:59.713
Truly.

00:55:13.977 --> 00:55:15.770
Just ask me to come with you.

00:55:19.149 --> 00:55:20.859
Say what you really want.

00:55:29.367 --> 00:55:31.411
You want me to come with you, don't you?

00:55:43.006 --> 00:55:43.882
Yes.

00:57:52.260 --> 00:57:53.428
Are you okay?

00:57:55.513 --> 00:57:56.598
Yeah.

00:57:58.683 --> 00:58:00.518
Don't you feel scared?

00:58:04.564 --> 00:58:05.773
I'm not scared.

00:58:09.486 --> 00:58:10.820
That's good to hear.

00:58:14.032 --> 00:58:15.241
Give me a hug.

00:58:33.134 --> 00:58:34.844
When we meet again…

00:58:37.347 --> 00:58:39.390
I promise I'll be a good friend.

00:58:41.684 --> 00:58:42.519
Okay.

00:58:44.103 --> 00:58:45.438
Let's meet again.

00:59:38.741 --> 00:59:40.076
Sang-yeon

00:59:40.660 --> 00:59:42.287
opened the valve.

00:59:44.747 --> 00:59:46.332
With resolve

00:59:47.542 --> 00:59:49.252
and without a moment's hesitation.

01:00:11.107 --> 01:00:12.025
Sang-yeon…

01:00:15.278 --> 01:00:16.738
you did well.

01:00:18.197 --> 01:00:19.907
You did so well.

01:00:21.868 --> 01:00:23.202
You held on so well.

01:00:30.585 --> 01:00:32.337
Everything is okay now.

01:02:29.996 --> 01:02:33.124
It took a long time…

01:02:35.668 --> 01:02:37.086
before I could finally…

01:02:39.672 --> 01:02:42.759
place a picture of you on my desk.

01:02:47.305 --> 01:02:51.350
Before I could finally bid you farewell.

01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:55.563
Goodbye…

01:02:59.817 --> 01:03:01.068
my friend…

01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:05.323
whom I hated…

01:03:10.328 --> 01:03:11.829
and loved.

01:03:16.667 --> 01:03:17.835
Cheon Sang-yeon.

01:08:05.748 --> 01:08:10.753
