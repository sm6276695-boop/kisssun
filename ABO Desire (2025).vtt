00:02:12.733 --> 00:02:13.533
drive

00:02:14.133 --> 00:02:15.066
Don't lose track

00:02:15.666 --> 00:02:17.566
The one in their car is my Al

00:02:31.333 --> 00:02:33.966
Brother, we're going to kill him now.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.266
Or should I remove the gland first?

00:02:36.766 --> 00:02:38.066
Let's remove the gland first.

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.366
If you can record the slaughter video after glandular defect

00:02:41.533 --> 00:02:43.166
Employer is willing to pay more

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.600
I woke up

00:02:50.766 --> 00:02:51.800
Oh shit

00:02:51.866 --> 00:02:54.600
Isn't it said that the dosage can make an elephant unconscious for a whole day?

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.566
Is this the physique of SGL?

00:02:58.733 --> 00:03:00.233
Like a fucking monster

00:03:01.933 --> 00:03:05.000
Why are you panicking? It's just right.

00:03:06.333 --> 00:03:08.233
Just let me take a look

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:11.433
You're S-level

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.800
How did he die at the hands of our DJL?

00:03:41.266 --> 00:03:42.500
Two friends

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:44.766
We have never met

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.266
It seems there is no festival.

00:03:59.866 --> 00:04:03.366
The two of us in the Sheng family usually

00:04:04.333 --> 00:04:06.500
Although it can't be said that I have made many good friends

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:08.833
But rarely make enemies

00:04:09.733 --> 00:04:11.500
Two late night visitors

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.666
Most likely for money

00:04:17.333 --> 00:04:18.666
In this case

00:04:19.733 --> 00:04:21.566
Let me go first

00:04:22.733 --> 00:04:25.166
Let's talk calmly

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.766
Shut up and don't talk nonsense to me

00:04:27.966 --> 00:04:29.400
In addition to being strictly

00:04:29.733 --> 00:04:32.200
You have no other choice but to be strict

00:05:20.733 --> 00:05:21.900
Up to you

00:05:22.666 --> 00:05:24.300
Cut me first

00:05:36.566 --> 00:05:40.166
Hahahaha, this is an anesthesia machine with chemicals added.

00:05:40.533 --> 00:05:42.233
Aren't you amazing?

00:05:42.733 --> 00:05:43.966
I got shot

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:45.566
Don't even mention S-level

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.400
Even a Z-level player must die.

00:05:47.733 --> 00:05:49.966
Damn, you dare to plot against me

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.200
I want your life

00:05:52.866 --> 00:05:54.400
Go to hell

00:06:06.666 --> 00:06:09.300
Who are you and how did you get in?

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:13.833
First

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:17.400
There is no Z-level l-room in this world

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.433
S-level is already obedient, right?

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:21.300
second

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:24.300
Your knife flashed in my eyes

00:06:26.066 --> 00:06:27.200
third

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:31.066
He is my law

00:06:32.366 --> 00:06:33.800
Want his life

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:37.966
Who do you think you are?

00:06:43.866 --> 00:06:44.666
ah

00:06:56.333 --> 00:06:57.133
hey

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:02.900
Hahaha

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:10.700
Kneel down and apologize to Mr. Sheng immediately

00:07:10.933 --> 00:07:12.566
I can do it out of humanitarian spirit

00:07:12.566 --> 00:07:13.833
Spare your life

00:07:18.566 --> 00:07:20.066
I have very little patience.

00:07:21.566 --> 00:07:23.000
I count to 3

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:25.300
1

00:07:32.133 --> 00:07:35.266
Sancao is still jumping on the tree

00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:56.200
Who are you?

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:06.433
ha

00:08:07.066 --> 00:08:08.566
Haha, your shooting skills are really bad

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.666
I prepared two bullets.

00:08:10.866 --> 00:08:13.000
You're out of bullets.

00:08:14.466 --> 00:08:15.700
What to do then

00:08:25.533 --> 00:08:27.166
Although I want to die

00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:29.033
but

00:08:33.966 --> 00:08:35.300
Let's just forget it.

00:08:39.733 --> 00:08:41.233
Love words are highly toxic

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:43.066
If you get hit, you'll die.

00:08:44.333 --> 00:08:45.966
Killing is illegal

00:08:46.733 --> 00:08:48.233
Mr. Snake is so kind

00:08:48.966 --> 00:08:51.366
Even if I lied, he would get so angry.

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:54.000
He certainly wouldn't like someone who was being humiliated in front of him.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.500
A murderer who kills people

00:09:02.133 --> 00:09:03.366
You're lucky

00:09:29.733 --> 00:09:30.766
Mr. Sheng

00:09:30.966 --> 00:09:33.800
Permanent markers are supposed to be a wonderful thing.

00:09:35.566 --> 00:09:37.266
I wanted to keep it until after marriage.

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:39.600
But now I have to make up for it later

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:45.200
Mr. Xiong

00:09:45.933 --> 00:09:47.266
You are poisoned

00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:49.466
If I don't mark you forever

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:51.033
I can't save your life

00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:55.700
You must forgive me

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:59.800
Otherwise I will go crazy because of sadness

00:10:06.133 --> 00:10:08.033
cheap attach and your fat

00:10:08.733 --> 00:10:09.600
twist you

00:10:17.466 --> 00:10:18.266
not see

00:10:27.366 --> 00:10:29.266
No one is wrong

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:48.900
Ugly painting

00:10:49.166 --> 00:10:50.666
Eccentric character

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:53.666
Holding lips and leaving them painted

00:10:53.866 --> 00:10:57.266
The remaining injured people are thrown into my fire

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:02.433
I will always treat you well

00:11:02.766 --> 00:11:04.033
I can give you anything

00:11:10.533 --> 00:11:11.566
Target

00:11:41.366 --> 00:11:42.400
So pitiful

00:11:44.133 --> 00:11:46.300
Fever period caused by permanent marker

00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:48.966
Mr. Sheng must be feeling very uncomfortable.

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:14.700
I

00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:19.366
If it hurts, stop struggling.

00:12:19.366 --> 00:12:21.666
At worst, we'll collapse together.

00:12:24.133 --> 00:12:25.600
Do you know who I am?

00:12:50.466 --> 00:12:51.833
Are you sure you don't hate me

00:12:52.733 --> 00:12:54.233
Are you sure you want to pay attention to me?

00:13:00.966 --> 00:13:02.266
You are so annoying

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:04.866
I hate liars

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:07.066
Hate crazy people

00:13:08.333 --> 00:13:09.366
But bad

00:13:11.566 --> 00:13:13.666
I really like you bad

00:13:40.766 --> 00:13:42.466
Make a joke

00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:44.966
Don't be loved again

00:13:44.966 --> 00:13:45.900
How hard it is

00:13:46.066 --> 00:13:49.666
The harmless and hypocritical hug will exaggerate you

00:13:54.466 --> 00:13:56.633
Stop saying that.

00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:24.900
Hello, Mr. Shen

00:14:24.966 --> 00:14:26.466
Do you know where Mr. Sheng is?

00:14:26.533 --> 00:14:27.900
Where is Sheng Shaoyou going?

00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:29.233
How would I know?

00:14:29.366 --> 00:14:31.466
Could you please help me contact them about what they cost?

00:14:33.266 --> 00:14:35.700
Sorry, I can't contact Mr. Sheng.

00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:38.833
I called Mr. Hua but he didn't see me so I took the liberty to call you.

00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:40.633
I haven't contacted anyone.

00:14:40.766 --> 00:14:44.500
Sorry I can't help you.

00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:48.300
ah

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.033
Hey, get the secretary right, Secretary General

00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:55.400
Oh, you're finally back, didn't you know?

00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:58.033
Mr. Shen is not used to your absence these days.

00:14:58.166 --> 00:14:59.600
Other colleagues in the secretarial department

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:01.000
Be careful at work every day

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:01.966
nervous

00:15:02.333 --> 00:15:04.900
Afraid of being caught

00:15:05.366 --> 00:15:06.166
Feel sorry

00:15:07.166 --> 00:15:08.900
There were some accidents a few days ago

00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:11.466
It happened that my sister had surgery

00:15:11.666 --> 00:15:13.000
So I took a few days off.

00:15:13.533 --> 00:15:15.666
Oh, is everything settled now?

00:15:15.666 --> 00:15:17.466
Did your sister's surgery go well?

00:15:17.466 --> 00:15:18.600
All handled

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:20.066
The operation went smoothly

00:15:20.066 --> 00:15:22.633
Thank you Secretary General for your concern for me.

00:15:22.966 --> 00:15:24.500
Secretary Gao, what's wrong with you?

00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:25.900
You don't look well.

00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:28.466
I'm sorry.

00:15:28.866 --> 00:15:30.933
I'm going to the bathroom.

00:15:30.933 --> 00:15:31.833
Hurry up, hurry up

00:16:00.766 --> 00:16:02.300
Secretary Gao, are you okay?

00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:04.300
Did you eat something bad and get gastroenteritis?

00:16:06.933 --> 00:16:08.766
Our neighbor Oumeiga

00:16:08.766 --> 00:16:10.600
I've been vomiting a lot recently.

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:13.833
But he had morning sickness in early pregnancy.

00:16:13.966 --> 00:16:16.766
Secretary Gao, this should be acute gastroenteritis.

00:16:16.766 --> 00:16:18.000
We must pay attention to it.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:19.166
Take medicine on time

00:16:19.166 --> 00:16:22.266
If you feel really uncomfortable, see a doctor

00:16:24.733 --> 00:16:25.533
Um

00:16:26.166 --> 00:16:28.233
I will, thank you.

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:49.366
Okay, anything else you need?

00:16:52.166 --> 00:16:53.833
Our neighbor Oumeiga

00:16:53.933 --> 00:16:55.833
I've been vomiting a lot recently.

00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:59.000
But he had morning sickness in early pregnancy

00:17:02.733 --> 00:17:04.966
Can you get me another box of smoke bath test strips?

00:17:04.966 --> 00:17:06.066
This is

00:17:43.933 --> 00:17:46.166
Secretary Kang Mi, Secretary Kang Mi, let's go.

00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:25.233
Secretary Gao

00:18:26.666 --> 00:18:27.733
Research team report

00:18:27.733 --> 00:18:29.766
Please take it to Mr. Shen's office.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.166
Okay, I'll go right away.

00:19:13.166 --> 00:19:14.400
Good morning, Mr. Shen

00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:22.466
What time is it?

00:19:23.533 --> 00:19:24.866
It's half past twelve

00:19:25.466 --> 00:19:26.466
but

00:19:27.466 --> 00:19:29.400
Mr. Shen has been sleeping for two days

00:19:48.666 --> 00:19:50.166
Is there anything else that is uncomfortable?

00:20:06.533 --> 00:20:07.866
Where are the two kidnappers?

00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:10.600
Sent to the police station

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.666
Mr. Sheng, you have slept for more than 24 hours.

00:20:15.666 --> 00:20:17.466
You must be thirsty. Drink some water.

00:20:21.933 --> 00:20:23.633
You sent him to the police station.

00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:24.600
Um

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.733
I'm afraid Mr. Shen will be unhappy if I handle it privately.

00:20:27.733 --> 00:20:29.866
X Holdings started with arms

00:20:29.966 --> 00:20:32.366
Mr. Hua, who is used to watching the lives of the grass guards

00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:35.033
They actually sent the two kidnappers to the police station.

00:20:36.533 --> 00:20:37.800
Mr. Sheng is exaggerating.

00:20:37.866 --> 00:20:39.066
What Cao sees the people

00:20:39.766 --> 00:20:41.500
x Holdings has been operating for many years

00:20:41.566 --> 00:20:42.466
In the batch

00:20:42.733 --> 00:20:45.366
There are indeed some groundless rumors.

00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:48.066
But those are special measures for special times.

00:20:48.866 --> 00:20:50.700
Now the world is ruled by law

00:20:50.766 --> 00:20:53.000
Of course, we have to leave it to the law to resolve.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:54.800
It's decided

00:20:55.266 --> 00:20:56.233
so

00:20:56.866 --> 00:20:58.466
Mr. Hua will call the police

00:20:58.733 --> 00:21:00.566
Let me come back and change your password

00:21:01.100 --> 00:21:01.900
Um

00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:05.600
Slogans I saw in the community

00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:07.766
Should I call the police if I have any trouble?

00:21:09.366 --> 00:21:10.400
No password

00:21:10.666 --> 00:21:11.966
How did you borrow it?

00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:13.900
Just a password

00:21:15.066 --> 00:21:17.433
Small things

00:21:19.133 --> 00:21:20.666
Mr. Sheng ignores me

00:21:20.866 --> 00:21:22.900
This is the biggest problem in my life

00:21:24.133 --> 00:21:26.200
Scammers, stop pretending to be pitiful.

00:21:26.733 --> 00:21:28.033
I didn't pretend

00:21:28.366 --> 00:21:29.766
It's really pitiful.

00:21:34.766 --> 00:21:36.466
Sorry, Mr. Shen

00:21:38.066 --> 00:21:39.766
I didn't mean to deceive you.

00:21:39.766 --> 00:21:41.000
Cheating is cheating

00:21:41.866 --> 00:21:43.766
What's the point of turning it into intentional or not?

00:21:44.933 --> 00:21:45.733
Hanayu

00:21:46.533 --> 00:21:48.666
You are cautious and careful

00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:50.866
What do you want?

00:21:53.266 --> 00:21:55.066
Sorry, Mr. Sheng

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:58.500
Because I like you

00:21:59.466 --> 00:22:02.166
That's why I try hard to be the person you like.

00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:07.433
Make you like me too

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:12.766
Love me so lie to me

00:22:12.866 --> 00:22:15.566
No, I didn't mean to lie to you.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:17.866
only

00:22:18.766 --> 00:22:19.300
Mr. Sheng

00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:21.966
The look I like is so different from mine.

00:22:21.966 --> 00:22:23.466
So I said that?

00:22:23.466 --> 00:22:25.066
I don't like the l method

00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:27.400
But I've marked you forever.

00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:31.000
Mr. Sheng has a fantasy of using acupuncture to treat permanent marks.

00:22:31.133 --> 00:22:34.066
My friend, you really treat me like your sweetheart, don't you?

00:22:35.733 --> 00:22:38.100
I didn't lie to you, Mr. Shen.

00:22:41.166 --> 00:22:43.033
You don't like me lying

00:22:44.166 --> 00:22:46.366
Then I will never lie to you again

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:54.433
Mr. Sheng is hungry.

00:22:54.533 --> 00:22:55.600
fine

00:22:56.266 --> 00:22:57.433
Not very hungry

00:22:58.933 --> 00:23:00.100
I'll take a shower first.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.200
Mr. Shen, let me help you.

00:23:40.133 --> 00:23:40.933
Feel sorry

00:23:41.733 --> 00:23:43.433
I'm so out of control.

00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:49.833
Mr. Sheng, please stop trying to be tough.

00:23:50.733 --> 00:23:53.400
In the end, you are the one who suffers and I am the one who feels sorry for you.

00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:54.833
We both lose

00:23:55.166 --> 00:23:56.200
Not worth it

00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:08.500
jing

00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:25.433
What's wrong

00:24:26.666 --> 00:24:27.833
I have something to say

00:24:28.966 --> 00:24:29.766
oh

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:34.866
Gaotu, if you have something to say, just say it.

00:24:34.866 --> 00:24:36.166
Don't whimper straight

00:24:39.733 --> 00:24:40.533
Mr. Shen

00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:43.866
I have a question for you

00:24:48.266 --> 00:24:50.066
Um, ask.

00:24:54.266 --> 00:24:55.266
if

00:24:56.866 --> 00:24:58.366
I mean if

00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:01.300
If my sister dares

00:25:02.466 --> 00:25:04.166
Pregnant with your child in the future

00:25:04.666 --> 00:25:05.600
what would you do

00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:06.666
I didn't dare

00:25:07.566 --> 00:25:10.100
Pregnant with my child

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:13.433
Of course, I knocked it down.

00:25:13.566 --> 00:25:16.566
Otherwise, it's so disgusting that I'm dying

00:25:17.266 --> 00:25:18.066
oh

00:25:22.366 --> 00:25:23.166
Disciple

00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:26.200
You found us that night

00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:28.966
No

00:25:29.533 --> 00:25:31.300
I'm just asking

00:25:35.133 --> 00:25:37.100
Can you please stop asking such boring questions?

00:25:37.533 --> 00:25:40.566
You know I hate it. I didn't see it.

00:25:42.766 --> 00:25:44.300
Do you have anything else?

00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:49.100
Don't you like children?

00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:49.900
right

00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:51.500
dislike

00:25:54.733 --> 00:25:57.066
But if I didn't dare to have an abortion,

00:25:57.566 --> 00:25:58.366
tell me

00:25:58.933 --> 00:26:01.100
You insist on discussing with me the problem that I dare not download

00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:01.900
Yes or no

00:26:08.133 --> 00:26:09.366
Could it be

00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:12.566
Your guy gets hot all the time, which makes me sensitive.

00:26:12.566 --> 00:26:13.633
A big belly

00:26:13.966 --> 00:26:15.166
I want you to be responsible

00:26:16.466 --> 00:26:18.233
No high support

00:26:18.866 --> 00:26:20.066
You figure it out

00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:21.400
You're a beta

00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:22.566
How many times did Oumeiga get pregnant?

00:26:22.566 --> 00:26:24.633
The odds are even lower than those of a scratch-off lottery ticket.

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.666
Even if that Oumei Ga is really pregnant

00:26:27.766 --> 00:26:30.066
You also have to figure out whose seed it is.

00:26:30.366 --> 00:26:32.066
Don't be fooled into taking responsibility

00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:34.766
After all, it is something that gets hot when you move it.

00:26:35.666 --> 00:26:37.200
Even if I have a big belly

00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:40.400
It's not certain whose child it is, Mr. Shen.

00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:44.666
Please don't always say things that insult us.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.500
This is the relevant provision of the ABO Equal Rights Agreement

00:26:48.533 --> 00:26:49.566
What's wrong, Gao Tu?

00:26:50.666 --> 00:26:53.000
You, a Beta, are going to jump us and sue me.

00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:27.500
You want to resign

00:27:28.333 --> 00:27:30.000
A talented disciple

00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:32.533
Because I didn't say much.

00:27:32.533 --> 00:27:33.866
You're going to resign from me.

00:27:34.333 --> 00:27:35.900
Are you out of your mind?

00:27:35.900 --> 00:27:37.800
Do you know what you are doing?

00:27:39.166 --> 00:27:40.033
I know

00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:42.100
Mr. Shen

00:27:42.733 --> 00:27:44.966
I know exactly what I'm doing

00:27:47.133 --> 00:27:49.200
Thank you very much for your care all the time

00:27:49.933 --> 00:27:51.566
But for personal reasons

00:27:51.700 --> 00:27:52.200
mine

00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:54.666
I can't continue this job now.

00:27:54.666 --> 00:27:57.000
Do we no longer need to pay for Xiaoqin's medical expenses?

00:27:57.400 --> 00:27:59.666
You think it's easy to find a job nowadays, right?

00:27:59.666 --> 00:28:01.266
I know it's hard to find a job nowadays.

00:28:02.466 --> 00:28:04.833
I also know that Xiaoqing will need a lot of expenses in the future.

00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:06.433
but

00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:16.166
My European and American dare to get pregnant

00:28:16.166 --> 00:28:17.466
What did you say

00:28:18.533 --> 00:28:19.800
I have to take care of her

00:28:21.466 --> 00:28:22.833
I just knew it

00:28:22.933 --> 00:28:23.733
Disciple

00:28:24.466 --> 00:28:26.300
For a pregnant European and American dare

00:28:26.366 --> 00:28:28.566
You're leaving the company and me.

00:28:28.566 --> 00:28:30.266
I absolutely won't agree.

00:28:30.266 --> 00:28:32.000
You left your mind at home?

00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:36.266
Get out of here and think it over for me.

00:28:36.466 --> 00:28:38.966
Don't come to see me before you think it through.

00:29:05.766 --> 00:29:06.566
Obviously

00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:10.033
I didn't mean to say this.

00:29:13.566 --> 00:29:15.833
Gray Wolf, seriously.

00:29:16.366 --> 00:29:17.833
Are you secretly in love with Secretary Gao?

00:29:18.100 --> 00:29:21.900
The fart earthquake blew your brain out, huh?

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:23.100
No?

00:29:23.133 --> 00:29:25.200
I think your secret crush is quite obvious.

00:29:27.333 --> 00:29:28.833
He wants my sister to have sex with him

00:29:30.566 --> 00:29:32.100
Who will like him

00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:50.666
Mr. Shen, is your waist sore?

00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:54.000
Okay, let me massage you on the bed.

00:29:54.100 --> 00:29:54.900
Need not

00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:59.000
Or I'm good at massage.

00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:00.366
I want to eat

00:30:00.700 --> 00:30:02.300
I'm starving, I need to eat.

00:30:04.533 --> 00:30:05.700
Don't worry

00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:08.166
Mr. Sheng will never starve to death

00:30:09.266 --> 00:30:11.433
I am very good at reporting Mr. Sheng's

00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:13.700
Don't move

00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:19.166
I hired someone to cook.

00:30:19.566 --> 00:30:20.900
There are only a few bags left

00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:23.166
You definitely don't want me to carry you out.

00:30:23.766 --> 00:30:26.400
But if you don't massage the sore muscles

00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:29.066
How are you going to get out by yourself?

00:30:29.166 --> 00:30:32.000
Humph, who do you think did this?

00:30:34.066 --> 00:30:35.033
I apologize

00:30:35.566 --> 00:30:36.666
It's all my fault

00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:38.900
Mr. Sheng, please punish me.

00:30:39.933 --> 00:30:41.700
I will spend my whole life making amends.

00:30:42.866 --> 00:30:44.500
Go out to eat. I'm hungry.

00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:12.600
Joe

00:31:24.933 --> 00:31:25.866
Mr. Sheng

00:31:26.133 --> 00:31:28.900
Liquid food is particularly friendly to awakening gastrointestinal function

00:31:29.300 --> 00:31:30.866
Just take a sip, okay?

00:31:30.866 --> 00:31:32.066
I hate porridge

00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:33.366
I know

00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:36.266
You know, um, you know

00:31:36.266 --> 00:31:37.966
In the past, she prepared porridge for me every day for breakfast.

00:31:37.966 --> 00:31:39.266
Noodles and buns

00:31:40.366 --> 00:31:43.266
Mr. Sheng, what did you like to eat in the past?

00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:44.900
Or the taste is too strong

00:31:44.900 --> 00:31:46.500
Or the taste is too strong

00:31:48.133 --> 00:31:49.666
You have too little experience

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.766
If you don't take good care of your stomach at this time

00:31:53.533 --> 00:31:55.066
You will have diarrhea

00:31:58.966 --> 00:32:01.100
Is Mr. Hua very experienced?

00:32:01.566 --> 00:32:04.633
I don't have any. I only like Mr. Sheng.

00:32:06.133 --> 00:32:08.833
Mr. Sheng, just take a sip.

00:32:09.066 --> 00:32:10.800
Just keep me company, okay?

00:32:12.166 --> 00:32:12.966
snort

00:32:18.733 --> 00:32:19.533
hmm

00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:32.266
My Omeka is pregnant.

00:32:32.266 --> 00:32:33.366
What did you say

00:32:34.533 --> 00:32:35.766
I have to take care of her

00:32:45.166 --> 00:32:49.066
There are several reasons why subordinates want to resign.

00:32:49.066 --> 00:32:50.000
Salary

00:32:50.933 --> 00:32:52.666
2. Being wronged

00:32:53.866 --> 00:32:55.900
3. Interference from outside

00:32:56.933 --> 00:32:58.566
Want to keep the hearts of colleagues

00:32:58.566 --> 00:33:00.866
Need to find the cause and prescribe the right medicine

00:33:02.866 --> 00:33:04.966
There are mainly the following ways

00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:07.033
One salary to retain employees

00:33:07.333 --> 00:33:08.766
Retain people with affection

00:33:10.966 --> 00:33:12.600
Management card is first-class

00:33:15.133 --> 00:33:16.633
What a mess

00:33:17.266 --> 00:33:20.000
His wife is pregnant and he has to go take care of her.

00:33:20.466 --> 00:33:22.100
What can I do?

00:33:30.333 --> 00:33:31.133
Gaotuo

00:33:32.866 --> 00:33:34.200
Would you still

00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:39.100
Can you please not

00:33:51.266 --> 00:33:52.600
If Secretary Gao leaves

00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:53.666
Our Secretariat

00:33:53.666 --> 00:33:56.266
It is difficult for anyone to take care of Mr. Shen's personal affairs.

00:33:58.366 --> 00:33:59.533
There are nectar trees in

00:33:59.533 --> 00:34:01.000
It's definitely okay.

00:34:01.466 --> 00:34:02.633
Although it is Emei Ga

00:34:03.066 --> 00:34:05.833
But it can be seen that Mr. Shen likes the nectar tree very much

00:34:06.100 --> 00:34:07.433
I like flower pupae

00:34:07.966 --> 00:34:10.666
Oh, Secretary Hua is different from you.

00:34:10.700 --> 00:34:11.666
I think Mr. Shen

00:34:11.666 --> 00:34:12.500
Treating Secretary Gao

00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:14.700
It's more of a spiritual dependence

00:34:14.866 --> 00:34:16.866
Treating Secretary Hua badly

00:34:16.866 --> 00:34:18.166
But I think compared to Hua Secretary

00:34:18.166 --> 00:34:20.033
Mr. Shen prefers Secretary Gao.

00:34:20.900 --> 00:34:22.100
Hey Secretary Gao

00:34:22.100 --> 00:34:25.066
If Mr. Shen personally asked you to stay, would you stay?

00:34:25.300 --> 00:34:26.233
No

00:34:27.066 --> 00:34:29.233
Mr. Shen is always surrounded by capable people.

00:34:32.133 --> 00:34:33.766
In order to keep up with everyone's pace

00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:35.800
I've never had it easy

00:34:36.100 --> 00:34:37.366
to be honest

00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:40.033
I actually planned to resign a long time ago.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:42.700
Oh, that's it.

00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:44.366
But our company's treatment

00:34:44.366 --> 00:34:46.466
It is well-known in the industry

00:34:46.900 --> 00:34:47.666
Secretary Gao

00:34:47.666 --> 00:34:50.666
Wouldn't it be a shame for you to quit now?

00:34:58.100 --> 00:34:59.066
Not a pity

00:35:01.533 --> 00:35:02.900
I think very clearly

00:35:03.300 --> 00:35:05.266
No matter who comes to save me, it won't change.

00:35:06.900 --> 00:35:09.266
Unless unless something

00:35:11.466 --> 00:35:14.800
Unless Mr. Shen is willing to give me 15% of the shares of HS Group

00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:19.033
Then I will consider staying and doing it.

00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:27.700
I'm kidding.

00:35:27.966 --> 00:35:31.500
I didn't expect Secretary Gao to be able to joke hahaha

00:35:46.133 --> 00:35:47.766
No matter who comes to save me, it won't change

00:35:48.066 --> 00:35:49.766
You've been wanting to resign for a long time, right?

00:35:49.866 --> 00:35:52.300
I want 15% of the shares before I stay.

00:35:52.533 --> 00:35:54.633
Get the hell out of here!

00:35:54.733 --> 00:35:55.866
Love to stay or not

00:35:56.300 --> 00:35:57.966
I won't be reluctant.

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:14.500
Hey, have you heard?

00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:16.700
Mr. Shen agreed to Secretary Gao's motivational application

00:36:16.733 --> 00:36:19.066
Secretary Gao was also transferred to the General Administration Office

00:36:19.066 --> 00:36:20.766
Let him go there to hand over the work

00:36:20.766 --> 00:36:22.600
General Administrative Office

00:36:22.733 --> 00:36:24.566
That's not the same level as us.

00:36:24.566 --> 00:36:26.300
Yes, this is clearly Mr. Shen

00:36:26.300 --> 00:36:27.900
I don't want to see Secretary Gao again.

00:36:29.366 --> 00:36:30.966
Hey, keep your voice down.

00:36:32.300 --> 00:36:33.266
Secretary Gao

00:36:35.500 --> 00:36:39.366
Even if I'm not here, you all have to work hard.

00:36:39.933 --> 00:36:41.900
Secretary Gao, we will miss you.

00:36:43.133 --> 00:36:44.000
Thanks

00:36:52.366 --> 00:36:53.566
What did you say

00:36:53.766 --> 00:36:57.966
The boss wants all employees of X Holdings to

00:36:57.966 --> 00:36:58.733
Paid leave

00:36:58.733 --> 00:37:00.633
Why one day

00:37:01.300 --> 00:37:02.666
Said there was a happy event

00:37:03.266 --> 00:37:06.633
x Holdings headquarters and all other subsidiaries

00:37:06.666 --> 00:37:07.866
Everyone has a day off

00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:11.433
He has been crazy for a long time.

00:37:11.733 --> 00:37:13.400
The boss means

00:37:13.666 --> 00:37:18.033
On such a good day, HS should also take a day off.

00:37:18.333 --> 00:37:20.200
He's not crazy enough alone

00:37:20.266 --> 00:37:22.066
I want the whole world to be with me

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:31.300
Is this footbath water?

00:37:31.300 --> 00:37:34.133
Sorry, Mr. Shen, this is Zhilanxiang's Baihao Yinzhen.

00:37:34.133 --> 00:37:35.466
Then Secretary Gao said

00:37:35.466 --> 00:37:36.866
This is your favorite tea

00:37:36.866 --> 00:37:38.600
Uh, can I get you a different drink?

00:37:38.700 --> 00:37:40.266
I only drink boiled white tea

00:37:40.266 --> 00:37:42.066
Sorry, sorry, is this your first day at work?

00:37:42.066 --> 00:37:44.233
I'll go change it right now. Sorry.

00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:50.366
Why are you so angry?

00:37:50.533 --> 00:37:52.200
But I see the boss

00:37:52.266 --> 00:37:54.266
I seem to be in a good mood recently.

00:37:54.266 --> 00:37:55.200
Yeah

00:37:56.266 --> 00:37:57.900
Sheng Shaoyou is willing to see him

00:37:57.900 --> 00:37:58.900
More than just seeing

00:37:59.466 --> 00:38:00.700
Early this morning

00:38:00.900 --> 00:38:03.266
The boss contacted the wedding planner

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:05.900
Said to hold one as soon as possible

00:38:05.900 --> 00:38:08.033
A wedding that satisfies Mr. Sheng

00:38:09.933 --> 00:38:11.600
Then let him marry her.

00:38:11.766 --> 00:38:14.866
I think he is quite suitable for being a gull for love.

00:38:15.366 --> 00:38:18.600
This might be very difficult for that person.

00:38:18.933 --> 00:38:20.233
No matter what

00:38:20.266 --> 00:38:21.300
No more than Hua Yong

00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:23.500
Learning how to cry is more difficult, right?

00:38:23.966 --> 00:38:24.900
Thinking back to those days

00:38:25.133 --> 00:38:27.666
Just because Sheng Shaoyou likes the European and American feeling of crying

00:38:28.066 --> 00:38:30.766
He's almost seen all the psychologists in the ass.

00:38:31.100 --> 00:38:33.200
In the end, I didn't learn to cry like this

00:38:33.333 --> 00:38:35.633
I suspect my tear ducts are damaged.

00:38:35.666 --> 00:38:37.266
I also went to see an ophthalmologist.

00:38:38.933 --> 00:38:40.233
The boss is for the sake of the Saint

00:38:40.500 --> 00:38:41.900
I really suffered a lot

00:38:41.900 --> 00:38:43.900
Oh yeah

00:38:44.533 --> 00:38:46.533
The targeted drug that Sheng Shaoyou wants

00:38:46.533 --> 00:38:48.000
You don't need me to send you anymore.

00:38:48.333 --> 00:38:50.066
Just let Hua Yong give it to him directly

00:38:50.133 --> 00:38:51.800
Just treat it as a token of love

00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:54.166
Saving the Father

00:38:54.300 --> 00:38:55.600
pledge one's life

00:38:55.700 --> 00:38:57.000
Very good, very good

00:39:02.966 --> 00:39:05.300
District leaders came to inspect Mr. Sheng this afternoon.

00:39:05.300 --> 00:39:07.033
Arranged the public relations team to rent and receive orders

00:39:07.100 --> 00:39:09.266
Mr. Sheng called you but you didn't answer

00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:11.500
Will you attend the 10:30 meeting?

00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:14.000
Mr. Sheng, I will arrange for the meeting to proceed normally.

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:15.433
You can participate at any time when you come to the company

00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:17.100
Mr. Sheng, are you okay?

00:39:17.100 --> 00:39:18.200
Why is my phone turned off?

00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:20.200
I'm fine now in Tang

00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:22.866
Cheng Binjiang helped me prepare the car to go back to the company

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:28.900
Mr. Sheng, um

00:39:29.333 --> 00:39:31.400
These few days

00:39:32.100 --> 00:39:33.633
I've been feeling delirious these past few days.

00:39:34.066 --> 00:39:36.266
I don't remember what I said or did.

00:39:36.500 --> 00:39:37.400
We will do

00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:39.166
Nothing happened, okay?

00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:40.700
But

00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:43.266
Mr. Sheng has accepted my mark.

00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:45.033
mark

00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:48.300
My dear flower friend, you really treat me as your sister, don't you?

00:39:48.566 --> 00:39:49.766
I don't

00:39:50.300 --> 00:39:52.766
I know better than anyone that nature wins is Al Law

00:39:54.666 --> 00:39:57.400
Then stop talking about stupid things like labels.

00:39:58.333 --> 00:40:02.400
But it's nothing, but flower friends, I am a l method

00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:03.300
How can I accept it?

00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:05.400
Used as a sense of odd density by another method

00:40:05.400 --> 00:40:06.433
use

00:40:07.100 --> 00:40:08.100
Mr. Saint

00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:10.133
How can you use this obviously

00:40:10.133 --> 00:40:11.500
What are the discriminatory words?

00:40:11.700 --> 00:40:12.500
mineral springs

00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:15.500
Why do I like you?

00:40:16.266 --> 00:40:17.833
It's not that you like me

00:40:22.333 --> 00:40:24.600
I don't want to bother with you about these boring issues anymore

00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:27.166
Are you full? Where are you going?

00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:29.300
Back to the company

00:40:30.533 --> 00:40:32.100
Then I'll go with you.

00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:35.800
Are you free?

00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:37.933
X Holdings is such a large enterprise

00:40:37.933 --> 00:40:39.300
Doesn't the boss have to take care of things?

00:40:39.300 --> 00:40:41.400
Well, I'm currently very free.

00:40:41.666 --> 00:40:43.166
In order to pursue Mr. Sheng

00:40:43.166 --> 00:40:45.100
I specially asked for a three-year long vacation for myself

00:40:49.133 --> 00:40:50.900
Staying in Edo all day to rule the country from behind the scenes

00:40:50.900 --> 00:40:52.366
The sky is high and the emperor is far away

00:40:52.900 --> 00:40:54.600
Be careful that Laos, which split from the country, will be taken over one day.

00:40:54.600 --> 00:40:55.600
I don't know

00:40:56.733 --> 00:41:00.200
Mr. Sheng, you are worried about me.

00:41:00.500 --> 00:41:02.066
Don't flatter yourself

00:41:03.466 --> 00:41:04.600
Um

00:41:05.900 --> 00:41:08.000
If there really is such a day

00:41:08.666 --> 00:41:10.433
Then I will come to Mr. Saint

00:41:10.900 --> 00:41:12.433
Then eat your

00:41:12.466 --> 00:41:13.266
Use your

00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:16.100
I'll stay by your side forever, okay?

00:41:19.100 --> 00:41:20.233
not good

00:41:21.333 --> 00:41:23.366
I hate stray dogs the most.

00:41:23.366 --> 00:41:24.166
oh

00:41:24.666 --> 00:41:27.366
Really? Mr. Shen likes winners.

00:41:27.466 --> 00:41:29.600
Well, I'm good at winning.

00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:30.700
And never lose

00:41:36.600 --> 00:41:38.166
Mr. Sheng, are you okay?

00:41:38.466 --> 00:41:40.566
I'm fine. Is the equipment ready?

00:41:40.566 --> 00:41:43.000
Yeah, we're already in the basement.

00:41:44.966 --> 00:41:45.966
Mr. Sheng

00:41:48.866 --> 00:41:50.400
You don't actually need someone to pick you up.

00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:51.800
I can take you there.

00:41:52.166 --> 00:41:54.166
Chen Bingming has prepared the car

00:41:54.166 --> 00:41:55.866
Don't bother Mr. Hua.

00:41:56.266 --> 00:41:57.966
Okay

00:41:58.000 --> 00:41:59.466
Then let's go change clothes together

00:42:04.933 --> 00:42:06.066
I'll take your car too.

00:42:26.500 --> 00:42:28.233
Mr. Sheng, are you okay?

00:42:28.333 --> 00:42:29.866
If Secretary Chang hadn't sent me a message

00:42:29.866 --> 00:42:31.233
I almost called the police.

00:42:31.900 --> 00:42:33.266
Just some skin and flesh

00:42:33.266 --> 00:42:35.066
I have consulted my family doctor

00:42:35.333 --> 00:42:36.233
No big deal

00:42:38.166 --> 00:42:39.300
How did it become like this?

00:42:39.466 --> 00:42:40.266
Did you call the police?

00:42:40.266 --> 00:42:41.266
Where is the prisoner?

00:42:42.366 --> 00:42:43.866
The prisoner has been caught

00:42:44.366 --> 00:42:45.233
Secretary Chen

00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:46.900
The criminal has been rescued

00:42:46.900 --> 00:42:48.066
You don't have to worry

00:42:49.533 --> 00:42:50.366
Flower Teacher

00:42:52.066 --> 00:42:53.666
Secretary Chen is really good at doing things

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:56.033
The company's security system is a mess

00:42:56.300 --> 00:42:58.433
You don't even know that Mr. Sheng was kidnapped.

00:42:58.900 --> 00:43:01.833
Okay, stop talking about this at the door.

00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:04.500
What other interests are you planning today?

00:43:04.566 --> 00:43:06.366
There's a briefing meeting in half an hour.

00:43:06.966 --> 00:43:07.766
Um

00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:10.666
By the way, Mr. Sheng

00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:14.866
Your father's medicine this month

00:43:18.866 --> 00:43:19.766
Flower lovers

00:43:22.366 --> 00:43:23.900
You want to threaten me

00:44:00.700 --> 00:44:02.233
After the red flowers

00:44:06.766 --> 00:44:08.766
You are gentle enough, don't forget

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:19.066
If you are obedient,

00:45:59.066 --> 00:46:00.666
No talking even when the lights are on

00:46:00.666 --> 00:46:02.566
New fashion is hanging

00:46:49.900 --> 00:46:51.633
Isn't that awesome enough?

00:46:52.066 --> 00:46:53.833
Stop talking

00:46:54.666 --> 00:46:55.900
