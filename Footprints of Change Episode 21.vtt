[Episode 21]

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:57.590
Hello, Mr. Wen.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.759
Hello.

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.150
You're here.

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.660
I called you many times
but couldn't get through.

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.000
I knew you must be busy.

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:20.290
I was planning to visit you
after submitting my manuscript.

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:23.960
Let me make you some tea.

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:26.630
No need.

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.490
I have to leave soon.

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:31.960
In such a hurry?

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.590
I came to see you.

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.800
Besides,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.260
I want to give you a hug.

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:59.840
What happened?

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.190
Nothing.

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:03.970
I've just been too busy lately

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.090
so that I can't visit you often.

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.990
No matter how busy you are,
you should take care of yourself

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:14.470
I will.

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:18.400
You should take good care of yourself too.

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:20.840
I will.

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:41.400
Well,

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:42.840
I have to go.

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:45.500
Let me see you out.

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:46.120
No.

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:48.360
Carry on with your work.

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:21.500
Are you going to sit there?

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:24.430
Here.

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:26.250
Get some fresh air.

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:41.159
Before I came here,

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:42.480
I called Jiang.

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:44.920
Everyone at home is doing fine.

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:45.800
Huzi

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.120
pulled a female classmate's braid

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.650
and got reported to the school
by her parents.

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:54.050
Among all your sons,

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:55.740
Huzi resembles you the most.

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.670
That little rascal takes after me.

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:59.650
He is as mischievous as I am.

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:00.630
In the future,

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:02.870
please help me keep an eye on him.

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:06.310
Yes.

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:07.000
Scholar.

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:09.240
Thank you.

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:10.750
I heard that

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:12.380
for my sake,

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:14.120
you've asked every officer

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.800
in the entire division for help.

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:16.270
Yes.

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:19.080
I've borrowed money
from everyone I know.

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:20.730
I also learned that

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:23.040
as long as I can repay the money,

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:25.390
it will be beneficial for me.

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:27.460
That's right.

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:30.390
I've borrowed most of it already.

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:32.320
I'll figure out how to get the rest.

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:33.650
By the way,

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:35.070
this afternoon,

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:36.810
Ms. Fang mentioned that

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:37.830
she

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:39.600
discussed with Political Commissar Yan.

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.460
He will also help find a solution.

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:43.190
So, don't worry.

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:45.310
Don't carry such a heavy burden.

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:46.830
I'm not worried.

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:48.870
It's fine even if you can't
raise the money.

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:51.130
At worst, I'll stay here a few more years.

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:53.960
I can start over after I get out.

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:56.600
Bullshit! You're such an idiot.

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:00.430
If you had listened to me earlier,
things wouldn't have developed like this.

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:01.240
Alright.

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:03.870
I read your self-criticism letter.

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:05.550
It was quite sincere.

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:07.160
But there are

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:08.390
typos

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:09.920
and grammatical mistakes.

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:12.120
You have correct to them.

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:13.580
The wording is imprecise.

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:14.530
I'll fix it.

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:17.430
I'll make whatever changes you suggest.

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:19.230
Now you're listening to me, huh?

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:21.180
I've always listened to you.

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:23.420
From now on,

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:26.460
I'll seriously reflect on myself

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:27.890
and turn over a new leaf.

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:28.690
Don't worry.

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:30.000
It's a good time

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:30.800
for you

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:32.830
to calm your mind here

00:06:33.159 --> 00:06:34.290
and read more books.

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:37.390
Reading books. You always say

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:42.190
through diligent study,

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:44.140
you can gain wealth and...

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:47.920
Be imprecise again.

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:49.210
Don't misuse phrases.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.530
Ms. Fang said she would visit you
in a few days.

00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:58.390
She'll come here.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.330
Jiang and I will also visit you regularly.

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:03.460
If you need anything, let me know.

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:05.360
I'll bring it for you.

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:07.970
Actually, I'm doing fine here.

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:09.240
I don't need anything.

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:11.240
Chief,

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:12.270
time's up.

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:15.360
Don't worry.

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:18.960
I'll figure everything out.

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:21.300
-Go back.
-Go back.

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:24.680
I'm leaving.

00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:27.510
Scholar.

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:31.100
My watch

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:32.440
has been

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:34.190
running inaccurately.

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:35.720
Fix it for me again.

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:37.930
Okay.

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:40.490
I'll bring it back next time I come.

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:23.630
Hello?

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:24.870
It's me.

00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:26.800
Xiurong.

00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:28.410
Hangong, he...

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:31.460
What happened?

00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:34.320
Hangong passed away.

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.659
He hanged himself with a belt.

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:41.870
He left a note for you,

00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:44.030
saying he couldn't live like this.

00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:45.630
It's too shameful.

00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:54.440
Mrs. San.

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:56.800
Where is Minister Wen?

00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:58.040
He's in the study.

00:09:59.030 --> 00:10:01.230
Once he starts working, he is untiring.

00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:05.330
What's in this bag?

00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:09.510
I brought tablecloths, mattress pads,

00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:10.390
and curtains.

00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:12.920
You should live a decent life.

00:10:13.390 --> 00:10:14.960
We have to change the curtains?

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:16.380
Look, the curtains are torn.

00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:17.330
He doesn't get a say in this.

00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:18.660
I'll make the decision.

00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:22.240
You know, Secretary Zhao

00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:24.710
served in the same troop as Minister Wen.

00:10:24.730 --> 00:10:26.030
Why are they so different?

00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:28.000
Secretary Zhao understands
the principle that

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.510
only by living well can one work well.

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:31.630
Yes, yes.

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:34.070
Come help me.

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:35.790
Let's change the curtains first.

00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:36.360
Okay.

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:01.200
Look, Mrs. San. Isn't it beautiful?

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:02.950
It's beautiful. Very beautiful.

00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:03.830
Right?

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:04.950
In life,

00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:07.110
you should be frugal where necessary.

00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:08.510
But where it's not needed,

00:11:08.510 --> 00:11:10.480
you don't need to be hard on yourself.

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:12.410
Make sure you're comfortable
where it counts.

00:11:12.410 --> 00:11:14.670
How can he keep sleeping on that hard bed?

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:15.790
If he refuses,

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:17.490
when Secretary Zhao comes,

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:19.440
we'll persuade him together.

00:11:25.870 --> 00:11:27.470
Zhao Hangong made a mistake.

00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:29.330
What do you want to learn from him?

00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:30.310
Right is right.

00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:31.410
Wrong is wrong.

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:34.410
A Party member should stand firm
in his position.

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:40.510
What is this? What is this?

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:42.240
I don't need these things.

00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:44.710
I don't need these to decorate my life.

00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:45.960
I don't need these.

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:49.270
I don't need it. I don't need it.

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:52.670
Don't need it.

00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:55.520
Get out!

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:01.950
Get out!

00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:34.380
[Shanghai Municipal People's Government]

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:49.460
Director Fang.

00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:52.670
Come in.

00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:57.720
Remember this.

00:12:58.390 --> 00:12:59.390
How can I help you?

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:08.850
This is Political Commissar Yan,
my husband.

00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:11.240
He was also Wen Pu's former Chief.

00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:12.870
Hello, Mr. Yan.

00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:15.510
Perhaps

00:13:15.870 --> 00:13:17.200
I should come back another day.

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:17.910
It's fine.

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:19.720
There are no outsiders here.

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:21.520
Just tell me what's on your mind.

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:25.630
I wanted to ask

00:13:26.630 --> 00:13:28.830
if something happened to Minister Wen.

00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:32.000
Minister Wen is fine.

00:13:32.430 --> 00:13:33.490
It's Zhao Hangong.

00:13:36.450 --> 00:13:37.820
He passed away

00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:39.140
last night.

00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:40.600
He passed away?

00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:43.030
How could this happen?

00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:44.960
I saw Secretary Zhao a few days ago.

00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:46.790
Did he

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:48.920
have some kind of acute illness?

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:51.980
It seems Minister Wen
hasn't told you anything.

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:54.390
Your mindset

00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:56.840
and Minister Wen's

00:13:57.720 --> 00:13:59.580
have never been on the same level.

00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:02.550
So, he would rather torture himself

00:14:02.630 --> 00:14:04.290
than let you share his burden.

00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:07.940
If Rumei were here,

00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:11.850
Wen Pu would definitely have told her.

00:14:20.570 --> 00:14:21.120
Hello?

00:14:22.630 --> 00:14:23.240
Ms. Xia?

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:24.510
Okay.

00:14:24.510 --> 00:14:26.270
I'll be right there.

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:27.300
What happened?

00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:30.160
Minister Wen has been taken
to the hospital.

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:31.360
What happened to him?

00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:33.750
He might have accidentally fallen

00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:34.840
and hurt his back.

00:14:35.790 --> 00:14:36.480
Yi.

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:38.670
You can't visit him now.

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:41.030
Let him have some peace

00:14:41.510 --> 00:14:42.600
and recover.

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:46.300
It's an old injury from his time
on the battlefield.

00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:47.040
It's fine.

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:53.120
You didn't know about this, did you?

00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:57.050
Why do you know nothing?

00:14:58.550 --> 00:15:00.000
Alright, go back now.

00:15:00.430 --> 00:15:01.960
I need to go check on him too.

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:13.160
[All this time,]

00:15:13.890 --> 00:15:16.750
[I thought I understood
Wen Pu better than anyone.]

00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:19.000
[I believed we were partners]

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.130
[facing all difficulties together.]

00:15:21.930 --> 00:15:24.190
[But when he was at his most vulnerable,]

00:15:24.490 --> 00:15:26.300
[he chose to hide it from me.]

00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:30.690
[Whether it's the death of
his close friend]

00:15:30.690 --> 00:15:32.300
[or his physical pain,]

00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:35.420
[he chose to bear it alone.]

00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:38.790
[I realized I've never entered]

00:15:39.870 --> 00:15:41.120
[his inner world.]

00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:49.550
Madam.

00:15:52.170 --> 00:15:52.890
Excuse me,

00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:54.290
who are you?

00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:55.440
I'm Zhou Yunqing.

00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:58.290
I'm bringing something for Minister Wen.

00:15:59.290 --> 00:16:00.440
Come in, come in.

00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:02.010
Please.

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:02.910
Thank you.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:05.670
Sir.

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:06.800
Zhou.

00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:10.360
my sister asked me to bring you something.

00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:15.600
Where is she?

00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:17.120
She left.

00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:19.010
Where did she go?

00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:22.810
Northwestern region.

00:16:27.750 --> 00:16:30.120
She left the plasters for your back pain.

00:16:30.530 --> 00:16:32.790
She also made some clothes
for Yuanyuan and Changjiang.

00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:34.390
Which part of the Northwest?

00:16:38.510 --> 00:16:39.570
She didn't tell me.

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:41.780
When did she leave?

00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:44.150
This morning.

00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:46.210
I took her to the train station.

00:16:48.390 --> 00:16:49.030
Sir.

00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:50.340
I'll leave these things here.

00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:51.200
I'll leave now.

00:18:13.790 --> 00:18:15.830
Because I feel those heroes and gods

00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:17.360
are all too distant from me.

00:18:17.510 --> 00:18:18.720
Apollo

00:18:19.210 --> 00:18:20.240
loved Marpessa.

00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:22.160
He promised her immortality.

00:18:22.550 --> 00:18:24.150
But she gave up immortality.

00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:26.070
She chose her own kind.

00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:28.830
She said she was just an ordinary person.

00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:31.920
She wanted to grow old with her husband.

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:33.480
I think the ancient Greeks

00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:34.920
are truly remarkable

00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:36.180
to have such awareness

00:18:36.550 --> 00:18:37.750
in love and marriage.

00:19:02.430 --> 00:19:05.420
[Six months later]

00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:37.090
Who is it?

00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:39.550
Mr. Yang, it's me.

00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:46.000
Coming.

00:19:53.810 --> 00:19:54.810
Comrade Yunqing,

00:19:55.210 --> 00:19:55.920
hello.

00:19:57.160 --> 00:19:59.280
I come to visit you
on behalf of the committee.

00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:00.140
Please come in.

00:20:05.310 --> 00:20:07.260
Comrade Yunqing, you must be hungry.

00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:08.150
If you haven't eaten,

00:20:08.150 --> 00:20:09.000
I can cook for you.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:09.680
No need.

00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:11.850
I brought you some food.

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:12.850
I made it myself.

00:20:13.670 --> 00:20:14.950
I can cook now.

00:20:17.810 --> 00:20:18.970
Comrade Yunqing,

00:20:19.730 --> 00:20:20.650
I'm so glad

00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:22.640
that

00:20:23.310 --> 00:20:24.350
you came to see me.

00:20:25.550 --> 00:20:26.810
Did you hear anything?

00:20:27.690 --> 00:20:28.950
You must have heard it.

00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:31.610
I won't hide it from you.

00:20:32.170 --> 00:20:32.970
The committee

00:20:32.980 --> 00:20:34.640
asked me to take a few days off.

00:20:34.930 --> 00:20:36.610
But I think it's unnecessary.

00:20:36.830 --> 00:20:37.880
You know me well.

00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:40.480
Not being allowed to work
will make me sick.

00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:42.750
It's really absurd.

00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:46.110
The committee moved my home
from the fourth floor to the first floor

00:20:46.110 --> 00:20:48.670
in the name of caring about me.

00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:49.830
What kind of care is that?

00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:51.360
Mr. Yang, please calm down.

00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:53.750
The committee cares about you very much.

00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:54.950
You need to rest well.

00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:57.900
Only with proper rest can you
work effectively.

00:20:59.030 --> 00:20:59.790
Yes.

00:21:00.590 --> 00:21:02.390
But I'm feeling perfectly fine.

00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:04.070
Comrade Yunqing.

00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:06.100
I want to apologize to you.

00:21:08.610 --> 00:21:09.680
Last time,

00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:11.790
you mentioned my mother.

00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:14.680
Due to that,

00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:16.210
I lost my temper.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:18.070
I spoke harshly

00:21:18.350 --> 00:21:19.590
and said some harsh words to you.

00:21:19.590 --> 00:21:20.830
I want to apologize to you.

00:21:20.830 --> 00:21:21.400
But

00:21:21.820 --> 00:21:22.730
my apology

00:21:22.830 --> 00:21:24.160
is not meant to salvage anything.

00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:24.960
Mr. Yang.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.160
You are with great inner strength.

00:21:28.750 --> 00:21:30.480
No matter what difficulties you face,

00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:32.280
I believe you can overcome them.

00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:37.420
I brought you a folk remedy for insomnia.

00:21:37.750 --> 00:21:38.550
Give it a try.

00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:40.550
If you still can't sleep,

00:21:40.550 --> 00:21:42.480
I'll search for another solution.

00:21:45.310 --> 00:21:46.960
I have something to attend to.

00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:47.960
I'll be going now.

00:21:48.790 --> 00:21:50.850
I'll visit you again when I have time.

00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:52.480
Yunqing.

00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:09.400
I'm a bit scared.

00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:14.700
When you're not working,

00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:19.070
please spend more time with me

00:22:19.070 --> 00:22:20.270
and talk with me more,

00:22:22.110 --> 00:22:22.790
okay?

00:22:28.590 --> 00:22:31.120
The doctor said you should not
drink alcohol.

00:22:31.510 --> 00:22:32.970
Wait until you're better.

00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:39.010
Take care, Mr. Yang.

00:22:54.110 --> 00:22:55.510
How did I end up like this?

00:23:25.750 --> 00:23:26.440
Qing.

00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:28.320
Yi, you're back!

00:23:28.350 --> 00:23:29.440
-Xiurong.
-Yi.

00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:31.290
We've been waiting for you to come back.

00:23:31.290 --> 00:23:32.330
Did you miss me?

00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:33.570
Missed you terribly!

00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:34.880
Yi.

00:23:34.970 --> 00:23:35.750
On your trip to the Northwest,

00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:37.280
which places did you visit?

00:23:37.570 --> 00:23:39.400
I traveled all over
the Northwest this time.

00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:40.200
Was it fun?

00:23:40.310 --> 00:23:42.160
The local people are simple and sincere.

00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:43.570
They were all very kind to me.

00:23:43.570 --> 00:23:46.030
It gave me many new inspirations
for my work.

00:23:46.030 --> 00:23:47.360
Was the food delicious?

00:23:47.550 --> 00:23:49.210
You only care about food, huh?

00:23:49.270 --> 00:23:49.790
Yi,

00:23:49.790 --> 00:23:50.850
congratulations.

00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:52.640
Your design at the exhibition

00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:54.070
received unanimous praise.

00:23:54.070 --> 00:23:54.880
Many senior leaders will

00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:56.270
attend the meeting.

00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:57.000
Really?

00:23:57.590 --> 00:23:58.310
Ms. Yi.

00:23:58.340 --> 00:23:59.530
I'm really sorry.

00:23:59.830 --> 00:24:01.350
After you left, this place

00:24:01.350 --> 00:24:03.480
became a reading room
for the female workers.

00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:04.440
But don't worry.

00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:05.900
I'll have them clean it up soon

00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:07.270
and restore it to how it was for you.

00:24:07.270 --> 00:24:08.110
Don't bother.

00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:09.680
I'll leave after the meeting.

00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:10.680
For these few days

00:24:11.590 --> 00:24:13.050
I'll stay at Qing's place.

00:24:13.790 --> 00:24:14.680
I went on a field trip.

00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:16.300
The factory has been giving me funds
for research trips.

00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:17.960
It makes me feel a bit embarrassed.

00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:19.960
The factory doesn't have the money.

00:24:20.460 --> 00:24:22.860
It must be from someone
who cares about you.

00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:26.850
You'll leave right after the meeting?

00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:29.790
I got accepted into graduate school.

00:24:29.790 --> 00:24:30.480
Really?

00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:32.130
You're going back to school?

00:24:32.130 --> 00:24:33.790
I like the campus environment.

00:24:33.790 --> 00:24:34.660
I have class this afternoon.

00:24:34.660 --> 00:24:36.110
Come with me and look around?

00:24:36.110 --> 00:24:36.640
Okay.

00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:37.480
Let's go now.

00:24:37.830 --> 00:24:38.590
Now?

00:24:38.590 --> 00:24:39.120
Come on.

00:24:39.150 --> 00:24:40.130
Goodbye, Xiurong.

00:24:40.130 --> 00:24:41.020
Bye, Xiurong.

00:24:44.270 --> 00:24:45.610
This is your classroom.

00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:46.900
They're having class.

00:24:47.070 --> 00:24:47.980
Go to class.

00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:49.200
I'll just look around by myself.

00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:49.960
No,

00:24:50.270 --> 00:24:51.480
I want to show you someone.

Today's lecture

See?

00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:55.720
is about Chinese traditional culture

00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:57.550
and ancient Greek civilization.

00:24:57.550 --> 00:25:00.350
Minister Wen sometimes teaches
at the university

00:25:00.350 --> 00:25:02.510
because someone told him the story

00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:04.480
of

Was it you who told him that story?

Some students ask me a question.

00:25:20.110 --> 00:25:21.200
We are Chinese。

00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:23.570
China has 5,000 years of civilization.

00:25:23.570 --> 00:25:26.570
Why do we need to study
ancient Greek civilization?

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:28.110
What I want to say is

00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:30.070
that ancient Greek civilization

00:25:30.070 --> 00:25:32.330
is the origin of European civilization.

00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:35.290
And in the course
of historical development…

00:34:58.510 --> 00:34:59.760
Nothing to brag about.

00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:01.070
There's nothing to be modest about.

00:35:01.070 --> 00:35:02.670
Your friend is quite honest.

00:35:03.670 --> 00:35:05.480
Xining is also quite remarkable.

00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:07.590
The position
of Shanghai Textile Bureau headquarters

00:35:07.590 --> 00:35:08.840
never accepted female candidates before.

00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:10.770
But they made an exception for her.

00:35:12.590 --> 00:35:13.920
You're too remarkable.

00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:16.210
Why don't you stay for dinner?

00:35:16.210 --> 00:35:16.890
No need.

00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:18.280
I have some matters
to attend to at school.

00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:19.630
Come on, we've all been busy all day.

00:35:19.630 --> 00:35:20.730
You've worked hard too.

00:35:20.730 --> 00:35:22.160
Next time.

00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:23.840
Alright then,

00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:25.190
next time.

00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:25.670
Okay.

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:26.530
I'll leave now.

00:35:26.530 --> 00:35:27.130
Okay.

00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:28.280
Bye.

00:35:29.550 --> 00:35:30.840
Let's have dinner together next time.

00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:31.480
Okay.

00:35:32.190 --> 00:35:33.000
Let's go.

00:35:35.850 --> 00:35:37.190
Is this dress really okay?

00:35:37.190 --> 00:35:38.760
Doesn't it make my waist look thick?

00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:39.400
Not at all.

00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:41.130
Your proportions are perfect.
It looks beautiful.

00:35:41.130 --> 00:35:42.520
Isn't this color too bright?

00:35:42.520 --> 00:35:43.380
Not at all.

00:35:43.510 --> 00:35:45.260
You'll be the most beautiful bride.

00:35:45.260 --> 00:35:47.710
I was worried I wouldn't look good
in this dress.

00:35:47.710 --> 00:35:48.760
Look at your perfect figure.

00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:50.190
If it were me, I couldn't even
fit into it.

00:35:50.190 --> 00:35:51.550
You're teasing me.

00:35:52.140 --> 00:35:53.670
It really looks beautiful.

00:35:54.030 --> 00:35:55.590
I do love this place.

00:35:56.510 --> 00:35:58.510
Your grandmother used to live here.

00:36:00.070 --> 00:36:02.280
Then your grandma must have been
quite wealthy.

00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:04.410
These old Western-style houses,
at the Republican era,

00:36:04.410 --> 00:36:06.070
were all owned by wealthy families.

00:36:06.070 --> 00:36:07.600
Well, from what she told me,

00:36:07.670 --> 00:36:10.000
her family was quite wealthy back then.

00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:12.110
But later her father squandered
their wealth

00:36:12.110 --> 00:36:13.510
and even sold the house.

00:36:13.590 --> 00:36:13.880
However,

00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:15.800
my grandmother worked here for some time

00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:19.000
and this is the place she fell in love
with my grandfather.

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:21.590
I remember you told me

00:36:21.630 --> 00:36:23.880
your grandparents had a happy marriage.

00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:25.190
So if I live here,

00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:26.480
I'll be happy too, right?

00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:27.630
Absolutely.

00:36:29.510 --> 00:36:32.030
I wish you an early arrival
of a precious child.

00:36:32.030 --> 00:36:34.000
I'm not ready yet.

00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:36.150
Although,

00:36:36.440 --> 00:36:38.590
Though
I've been looking forward to this day,

00:36:38.590 --> 00:36:40.000
when it's actually here,

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:41.030
I'm still...

00:36:41.090 --> 00:36:42.350
Still nervous, right?

00:36:43.140 --> 00:36:45.110
You'll understand when it's your turn.

00:36:45.110 --> 00:36:46.480
I'll throw the bouquet to you first,

00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:47.000
okay?

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:47.630
That's great!

00:36:47.630 --> 00:36:49.510
Pass this good luck to me.

00:36:49.510 --> 00:36:51.110
I'll pass it to you right now.

00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:52.940
Everything was fine at first.

00:36:53.590 --> 00:36:55.990
She seemed to cry
in the middle of the night.

00:36:56.840 --> 00:36:57.760
I was so tired

00:36:57.760 --> 00:36:59.110
that I didn't even bother to get up
and comfort her.

00:36:59.110 --> 00:37:00.840
I thought she was just excited.

00:37:04.670 --> 00:37:05.730
If that's the case,

00:37:06.550 --> 00:37:07.920
Shang Yunfei was indeed

00:37:08.070 --> 00:37:10.200
acting a bit strange during that time.

00:37:10.590 --> 00:37:10.960
Once,

00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:13.000
we college classmates
were drinking together.

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:15.400
He was the only one
who didn't touch a drop of alcohol.

00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:17.800
That day, my US visa had just
been approved.

00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:19.710
I was probably too excited

00:37:19.710 --> 00:37:21.440
and didn't pay attention to it.

00:37:22.760 --> 00:37:23.760
Professor Zhong,

00:37:23.930 --> 00:37:25.260
I have good news for you.

00:37:25.540 --> 00:37:27.000
My visa has been approved.

00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:28.450
That's impossible.

00:37:28.630 --> 00:37:30.110
US visas are so hard to get.

00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:34.190
Beichuan, I'm happy for you.

00:37:37.230 --> 00:37:38.230
Shang Yunfei

00:37:38.440 --> 00:37:39.960
borrowed 60,000 yuan from the Faculty

00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:41.760
using my name.

00:37:42.450 --> 00:37:43.550
The Faculty demanded

00:37:43.550 --> 00:37:45.810
that I repay the money within two months.

00:37:46.590 --> 00:37:47.590
Because of this,

00:37:48.590 --> 00:37:50.390
my trip to America fell through.

00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:53.010
The school also suspended my classes.

00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:55.280
That's terrible for you.

00:37:58.510 --> 00:37:59.500
Yahui told me

00:37:59.530 --> 00:38:01.760
that Shang Yunfei needed temporary funds
for his business

00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:03.400
and he could pay it back within a month.

00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:04.510
That's why I guaranteed for her.

00:38:04.510 --> 00:38:06.110
You even guaranteed for her?

00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:07.590
How much did you guarantee?

00:38:07.590 --> 00:38:08.480
50,000 yuan.

00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:09.540
So what happened to the money?

00:38:09.540 --> 00:38:10.480
Did you pay it back?

00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:11.860
My grandmother gave me a pocket watch.

00:38:11.860 --> 00:38:12.820
I sold it.

00:38:13.270 --> 00:38:14.580
No, I pawned it

00:38:15.030 --> 00:38:17.290
and used that money to pay the money back.

00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:20.380
A watch worth 50,000 yuan?

00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:23.300
Seems like your family is well-off.

00:38:23.630 --> 00:38:24.400
If we're comparing,

00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:26.000
you're much luckier than me.

00:38:26.150 --> 00:38:28.080
My monthly salary is only 200 yuan,

00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:30.380
and the school suspended my classes.

00:38:31.840 --> 00:38:32.960
I might soon have to

00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:34.630
ask my classmates

00:38:34.870 --> 00:38:36.200
to help me find a way out.

00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:40.440
Has your work been affected?

00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:42.840
Yes. Things are not good.

00:38:44.110 --> 00:38:45.550
But I have to stay positive.

00:38:45.550 --> 00:38:46.950
Don't follow my example.

00:38:47.930 --> 00:38:49.130
What happened to you?

00:38:49.290 --> 00:38:49.940
I'm fine.

00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:54.480
I just took a swim in Suzhou Creek.

00:38:57.990 --> 00:38:59.190
But I made it to shore.

00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:04.820
Seems like you're a good swimmer.

00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:10.070
Well,

00:39:11.030 --> 00:39:12.230
what should we order?

00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:13.540
Would you like a drink?

00:39:13.810 --> 00:39:15.210
No, thanks. You go ahead.

00:39:15.250 --> 00:39:16.450
Would you like a cola?

00:39:16.650 --> 00:39:17.770
No, thank you.

00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:19.850
Boss, a mung bean popsicle please.

00:39:24.430 --> 00:39:25.880
I'll be going back by the end of the year.

00:39:25.880 --> 00:39:26.800
Don't worry.

00:39:28.510 --> 00:39:31.070
Are you doing well with food and
accommodation there?

00:39:31.070 --> 00:39:32.370
Good. Just tell me if you need more.

00:39:32.370 --> 00:39:34.370
I'll mail it to you right away, okay?

00:39:35.450 --> 00:39:36.600
Excuse me, could you hurry up?

00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:37.860
Why are you rushing me?

00:39:41.660 --> 00:39:42.970
Who were you talking to just now?

00:39:42.970 --> 00:39:43.900
What do you want?

00:39:46.210 --> 00:39:47.270
What are you doing?

00:39:47.730 --> 00:39:48.760
Do you know who I am?

00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:49.550
No, I don't.

00:39:50.230 --> 00:39:52.730
I'm the boss of Junlong Company
on the second floor.

00:39:52.730 --> 00:39:53.600
Got it?

00:39:55.960 --> 00:39:56.820
Anything else?

00:39:57.170 --> 00:39:57.900
No, nothing.

00:39:58.210 --> 00:39:59.070
Then get going.

00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:03.670
I'm sorry.

00:40:03.670 --> 00:40:04.550
What are you sorry for?

00:40:04.550 --> 00:40:05.950
Who are you apologizing to?

00:40:05.950 --> 00:40:08.880
He's apologizing. How dare you talk
to him like that?

00:40:09.230 --> 00:40:10.560
What are you doing here?

00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:12.820
I asked what you're doing here.

00:40:12.820 --> 00:40:13.970
I paged you.

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:15.530
Why didn't you call me back?

00:40:17.230 --> 00:40:19.800
Everyone of importance in Shanghai

00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:21.590
uses a cell phone.

00:40:21.590 --> 00:40:23.260
No one uses pagers anymore, bro.

00:40:23.260 --> 00:40:24.710
Besides, I gave you my number last time.

00:40:24.710 --> 00:40:25.970
Why didn't you call me?

00:40:26.230 --> 00:40:27.590
You never gave me your number.

00:40:27.590 --> 00:40:28.920
Of course I did.

00:40:29.070 --> 00:40:31.040
You were too drunk to remember, right?

00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:32.630
Get a pen and paper.
I'll write it down for you now.

00:40:32.630 --> 00:40:34.150
Okay, okay. No need.

00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:36.360
Besides, when you got here,

00:40:36.360 --> 00:40:38.160
why didn't you come up to find me?

00:40:38.710 --> 00:40:40.150
You only told me where you are.

00:40:40.150 --> 00:40:41.400
You never told me your room number.

00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:43.070
I told you the room number.

00:40:43.670 --> 00:40:45.550
You forget everything when you drink.

00:40:45.550 --> 00:40:47.080
What's with all this stuff?

00:40:47.270 --> 00:40:48.200
What's going on?

00:40:48.260 --> 00:40:49.990
All these bags. Are you moving?

00:40:50.240 --> 00:40:50.840
What's that?

00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:51.760
Don't touch it.

00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:53.480
This is the only

00:40:53.670 --> 00:40:54.930
valuable thing I have.

00:40:55.440 --> 00:40:56.590
You actually have something valuable?

00:40:56.590 --> 00:40:57.360
Let me see.

00:40:57.360 --> 00:40:58.420
Don't mess with it.

00:40:59.150 --> 00:41:01.550
It's the most advanced personal computer.

00:41:01.950 --> 00:41:03.210
You've never seen one.

00:41:05.810 --> 00:41:06.600
Chuan.

00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:09.190
If you had money to buy it,

00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:11.230
you should have bought a cell phone.

00:41:11.230 --> 00:41:13.000
Now that you've left school,

00:41:13.290 --> 00:41:14.770
you need to network.

00:41:15.510 --> 00:41:16.970
How will you contact them?

00:41:17.500 --> 00:41:18.420
By pager

00:41:18.440 --> 00:41:19.600
and then stand around here?

00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:21.080
I told you many times.

00:41:21.110 --> 00:41:22.840
You need brains, business smarts.

00:41:22.840 --> 00:41:23.920
Enough.

00:41:24.440 --> 00:41:25.710
Why are you so nagging?

00:41:26.980 --> 00:41:28.330
Hurry up and take me
to get something to eat.

00:41:28.330 --> 00:41:29.160
I'm starving.

00:41:29.190 --> 00:41:30.340
Sure. Chinese or Western,
whatever you want.

00:41:30.340 --> 00:41:30.780
Let's go.

00:41:30.780 --> 00:41:31.680
You're treating?

00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:32.480
Wait a minute.

00:41:33.230 --> 00:41:34.290
Why should I treat?

00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:37.580
I bought you plenty of meals
when I was in school.

00:41:37.590 --> 00:41:38.960
Now you're a big boss.

00:41:39.070 --> 00:41:40.610
Why don't you treat one meal for me?

00:41:40.610 --> 00:41:41.780
Let's go. You're my bro.

00:41:41.780 --> 00:41:43.030
Let's go.

00:41:44.040 --> 00:41:45.100
Help me carry this.

00:41:45.330 --> 00:41:47.600
I must have owed you a fortune
in a past life.

00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:49.380
Then, help me carry this upstairs.
