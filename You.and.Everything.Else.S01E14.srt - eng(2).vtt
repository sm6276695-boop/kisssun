00:00:12.595 --> 00:00:13.805
I hate that you're fine.

00:00:17.684 --> 00:00:19.561
I want to see you ruined,

00:00:21.104 --> 00:00:22.147
like me.

00:00:25.734 --> 00:00:29.195
We'll pay you a development fee
and credit you accordingly.

00:00:34.409 --> 00:00:35.535
But it's mine.

00:00:36.619 --> 00:00:39.664
-Why would you pay me?
-I told you it's already mine.

00:00:48.256 --> 00:00:50.008
Do you know what I've learned in life?

00:00:56.598 --> 00:00:58.850
No one can resist money.

00:00:58.933 --> 00:01:00.185
The number you have called…

00:01:00.268 --> 00:01:02.854
I've yet to see someone
who has proven otherwise.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.567
Who do you think was the easiest

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.027
for me to convince?

00:01:16.951 --> 00:01:18.369
Director Ju Dong-hyang.

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.081
Director Ju.

00:01:24.417 --> 00:01:26.336
I know you're in there.

00:01:29.339 --> 00:01:30.173
Please?

00:01:32.175 --> 00:01:33.593
But I'll admit that

00:01:34.177 --> 00:01:36.805
I'm curious to see
if he'll change his mind.

00:01:40.308 --> 00:01:41.976
Especially considering

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.729
how you were willing
to give him Young Hearts before leaving.

00:02:28.022 --> 00:02:31.943
YOU AND EVERYTHING ELSE

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.160
Sang-hak.

00:02:42.871 --> 00:02:43.872
Eat up.

00:02:44.914 --> 00:02:46.082
I know you haven't eaten.

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.174
Why are you here?
You're supposed to be filming tomorrow.

00:02:54.924 --> 00:02:56.968
I heard everything from Producer Oh.

00:03:01.097 --> 00:03:04.559
I'll go after we grab a bite,
so don't give me a hard time.

00:03:05.393 --> 00:03:06.686
We owe each other this much.

00:03:07.896 --> 00:03:08.897
Eat up.

00:03:23.328 --> 00:03:24.996
Why would I give you a hard time?

00:03:25.663 --> 00:03:28.666
If something similar happened to you,
I would have been pissed too.

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:33.838
What did Director Ju say?

00:03:36.674 --> 00:03:38.051
I'll know when I talk to him.

00:03:39.093 --> 00:03:42.013
He wouldn't even see you?
When he's clearly there?

00:03:46.267 --> 00:03:47.352
I will see him.

00:03:50.104 --> 00:03:51.314
Don't get worked up.

00:03:51.898 --> 00:03:53.733
That's exactly what Sang-yeon wants.

00:03:57.403 --> 00:03:59.447
I’ve worked with him for four years.

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:02.992
I should give him the benefit of the doubt
until I hear his side.

00:04:16.547 --> 00:04:17.548
Director Ju.

00:04:19.926 --> 00:04:21.219
Hey, Producer Ryu.

00:04:31.145 --> 00:04:32.313
I was told that

00:04:33.314 --> 00:04:35.942
Producer Cheon and the division head
had sorted everything,

00:04:36.025 --> 00:04:38.069
so I assumed you'd agreed to it.

00:04:42.115 --> 00:04:43.116
You did?

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:47.453
You really thought
I’d hand over my project…

00:04:49.831 --> 00:04:52.125
without even discussing it with you?

00:04:56.087 --> 00:04:58.464
I simply took the company's word for it.

00:05:09.392 --> 00:05:10.601
Director Ju.

00:05:11.561 --> 00:05:13.021
Please look at me.

00:05:18.192 --> 00:05:20.778
It isn't too late, Director Ju.

00:05:23.406 --> 00:05:25.491
I know this is torture for you too.

00:05:26.492 --> 00:05:28.703
If I upset you in any way,
please tell me--

00:05:28.786 --> 00:05:29.871
No, stop.

00:05:30.455 --> 00:05:33.791
Did you hear about
the development fee and credit?

00:05:37.795 --> 00:05:38.796
Do you…

00:05:41.382 --> 00:05:44.135
honestly believe that’s all it takes?

00:05:46.304 --> 00:05:49.265
Legally, it's fine
as long as both companies agree.

00:05:54.395 --> 00:05:55.730
"Legally fine…"

00:05:59.942 --> 00:06:01.694
You, of all people,

00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:06.074
shouldn't speak to me like that.

00:06:09.911 --> 00:06:10.745
Why?

00:06:12.914 --> 00:06:14.123
Why not?

00:06:15.249 --> 00:06:17.627
I was switched out
due to that crappy contract.

00:06:18.127 --> 00:06:21.672
Knowing what JD did to me,
you shouldn't be acting like this either.

00:06:22.757 --> 00:06:25.968
Now that you mention it, didn't you
give me a reason to be upset first?

00:06:27.762 --> 00:06:30.890
I heard Gyeong Seung-ju was locked in
for Good Man before you told me.

00:06:31.891 --> 00:06:34.227
You knew,
yet what did you say when I asked?

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:35.645
That nothing was decided.

00:06:35.728 --> 00:06:39.273
Do you have any idea
how betrayed I felt when I found out?

00:06:47.698 --> 00:06:49.617
Why do you think I couldn't tell you?

00:06:51.828 --> 00:06:53.871
You’re just making excuses now.

00:06:54.789 --> 00:06:56.707
You know none of it was my fault--

00:06:56.791 --> 00:06:58.918
Okay, fine. I'm the jerk here.

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:01.462
But what choice do I really have?

00:07:01.546 --> 00:07:03.798
Who says you have no choice?

00:07:04.298 --> 00:07:06.134
You can shut this whole thing down--

00:07:06.217 --> 00:07:07.969
Honestly, I want to go!

00:07:11.139 --> 00:07:14.142
JD offers a measly upfront payment
of 30 million with a 10% share.

00:07:14.225 --> 00:07:15.643
Producer Cheon, however…

00:07:21.899 --> 00:07:22.942
What about her?

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:29.407
I'm the one who told her to pay you,

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:32.410
so you should know that I owe you nothing.

00:07:33.578 --> 00:07:34.787
I'm done talking.

00:07:36.414 --> 00:07:37.540
Director Ju.

00:07:40.209 --> 00:07:41.252
Director Ju!

00:07:42.753 --> 00:07:43.921
Director Ju!

00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:58.060
The development fee is 60 million,

00:07:58.561 --> 00:08:01.522
which means you and I
will each receive 30 million.

00:08:02.565 --> 00:08:05.276
FILM DEVELOPMENT CONTRACT
TERMINATION AGREEMENT

00:08:09.947 --> 00:08:11.282
How do you like the title?

00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:14.202
"Echoes of Summer."

00:08:16.913 --> 00:08:19.624
Let me know if you want to tweak
any of the wording.

00:08:19.707 --> 00:08:21.167
As long as it's not a sole credit--

00:08:35.473 --> 00:08:36.933
You're not taking the offer?

00:08:38.267 --> 00:08:39.894
All the better for me.

00:08:40.686 --> 00:08:44.607
Protecting your pride
won't do you any good, so just take it.

00:08:47.693 --> 00:08:49.612
I'll just let you be a thieving bitch.

00:08:57.119 --> 00:08:59.497
So this is what it takes to change you.

00:09:05.628 --> 00:09:07.755
How truly pathetic.

00:09:09.882 --> 00:09:11.259
You're always like this.

00:09:12.385 --> 00:09:15.429
On your high horse,
acting like you're always right.

00:09:16.556 --> 00:09:17.765
Wake up.

00:09:18.849 --> 00:09:21.102
You're being backstabbed right now.

00:09:21.769 --> 00:09:23.271
Just cuss me out already.

00:09:24.188 --> 00:09:26.023
Call me an evil bitch.

00:09:30.444 --> 00:09:32.280
But you're already doing that

00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:34.240
to yourself.

00:09:38.327 --> 00:09:39.829
I am, too, of course.

00:09:41.747 --> 00:09:43.124
I'll never forgive you.

00:09:44.584 --> 00:09:46.669
You lost a single paltry movie.

00:09:50.339 --> 00:09:53.050
Have you forgotten about
what you took from me?

00:09:56.387 --> 00:09:57.597
I…

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:02.310
truly dislike you.

00:10:04.312 --> 00:10:06.314
You can achieve
all the success in the world…

00:10:08.316 --> 00:10:10.860
but you'll always be
a pathetic, thieving bitch.

00:10:13.904 --> 00:10:16.240
If you understood, even a little,

00:10:17.617 --> 00:10:19.410
how radiant you once were…

00:10:22.622 --> 00:10:24.415
you wouldn't do this to yourself.

00:10:29.253 --> 00:10:31.380
Who would accept you in the end?

00:10:58.741 --> 00:10:59.867
CEO Cheon.

00:11:00.993 --> 00:11:01.994
Welcome.

00:11:03.704 --> 00:11:05.039
It suits you.

00:11:05.831 --> 00:11:06.666
"Swallow."

00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:08.918
A deadbeat drifter?

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:12.296
You're glowing.

00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:15.257
How was the Gangneung shoot?
Did everything go well?

00:11:15.966 --> 00:11:17.051
Just barely.

00:11:23.599 --> 00:11:25.518
I heard you took Director Ju's script.

00:11:26.185 --> 00:11:28.562
Yes, the first manuscript
will be ready next month.

00:11:28.646 --> 00:11:30.189
Was that really necessary?

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:32.233
You snagged Han Jae-jun.

00:11:33.818 --> 00:11:37.196
The more talented directors,
the better, right?

00:11:39.281 --> 00:11:40.616
That's all there is to it?

00:11:42.702 --> 00:11:44.245
Of course not.

00:11:50.084 --> 00:11:51.669
She called me a thieving bitch.

00:11:52.336 --> 00:11:54.755
You can achieve
all the success in the world…

00:11:57.591 --> 00:12:00.094
"But you'll always be a pathetic,

00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:02.138
thieving bitch."

00:12:05.516 --> 00:12:06.350
Feel misjudged?

00:12:07.935 --> 00:12:08.769
Not at all.

00:12:10.104 --> 00:12:11.856
Now that I've become a thieving bitch,

00:12:11.939 --> 00:12:13.774
I intend to taste real success.

00:12:13.858 --> 00:12:16.193
I'm going to buy a building in Gangnam.

00:12:19.155 --> 00:12:20.990
Why are you doing this to Producer Ryu?

00:12:31.417 --> 00:12:32.501
I can't stand her.

00:12:35.296 --> 00:12:37.465
You have no real chance of failure.

00:12:38.466 --> 00:12:39.675
You're smart and talented.

00:12:40.259 --> 00:12:42.803
You didn't have to go that far to succeed.

00:12:44.972 --> 00:12:48.768
You have no idea
how thrilled I am right now, do you?

00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:53.981
What you’ve done
will find its way back to you.

00:12:56.525 --> 00:12:57.693
Then so be it.

00:12:58.903 --> 00:13:02.823
Do you know what it's like
to be the one holding the sword?

00:13:04.784 --> 00:13:06.619
I have nothing to fear now.

00:13:09.497 --> 00:13:12.666
I just hope you won't hurt yourself
while swinging that sword of yours.

00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:15.544
I don't care if I do.

00:13:17.797 --> 00:13:19.215
I couldn't care less

00:13:20.216 --> 00:13:22.009
about what happens to me.

00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:31.936
SONG YU-CHAN

00:13:57.294 --> 00:13:58.462
She must be sleeping.

00:13:58.963 --> 00:14:01.131
That would be a relief, but I doubt it.

00:14:02.883 --> 00:14:06.512
She should take some days off.
She’s still doing it all, isn't she?

00:14:06.595 --> 00:14:09.640
She's doing everything and more.
I feel anxious just watching her.

00:14:10.474 --> 00:14:14.270
No one's surprised by Cheon Sang-yeon,
but what's up with Ju Dong-hyang?

00:14:14.854 --> 00:14:16.397
It must have been a tough blow.

00:14:16.897 --> 00:14:18.983
You should keep a close eye on Eun-jung.

00:14:19.066 --> 00:14:21.735
What could I do? It's not like I can help.

00:14:28.325 --> 00:14:29.159
Okay.

00:14:30.202 --> 00:14:31.453
Cut. We have our shot.

00:14:31.537 --> 00:14:32.746
Time for lunch, everyone.

00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:36.375
Lunch is in the first floor canteen.
Let's regroup here at 2:00 p.m.

00:14:36.458 --> 00:14:38.502
-Enjoy your meal, sir.
-You too.

00:14:39.545 --> 00:14:40.754
What do you think?

00:14:40.838 --> 00:14:42.172
I think it was great.

00:14:43.048 --> 00:14:46.802
I spoke with Manager Lim,
and she says Su-a is feeling much better.

00:14:46.886 --> 00:14:49.388
We can stick to the schedule
for the Chuncheon shoot.

00:14:49.471 --> 00:14:50.472
That's great.

00:14:51.223 --> 00:14:52.808
-Enjoy lunch.
-You too.

00:14:53.851 --> 00:14:54.935
On the first floor, sir.

00:14:57.938 --> 00:14:59.064
First floor.

00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:01.442
Lunch is on the first floor.

00:15:01.942 --> 00:15:02.776
I know.

00:15:43.317 --> 00:15:45.361
Guess what Hayao Miyazaki's motto is.

00:15:55.162 --> 00:15:59.208
"No matter how tough things get,
they eventually come to an end."

00:16:07.508 --> 00:16:08.592
That's nice.

00:16:12.638 --> 00:16:14.640
It sounds like something he'd say.

00:16:17.643 --> 00:16:18.811
That’s why

00:16:20.104 --> 00:16:21.981
you should at least eat.

00:16:25.985 --> 00:16:26.986
Sure.

00:16:30.948 --> 00:16:32.282
Just give me ten minutes.

00:16:35.077 --> 00:16:36.954
I'll be down in ten minutes.

00:17:16.827 --> 00:17:17.953
Everything…

00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:23.500
seemed so distant.

00:17:29.465 --> 00:17:32.968
It marked the entrance
to a dark tunnel ahead.

00:18:01.038 --> 00:18:02.247
God, you scared me.

00:18:04.958 --> 00:18:06.919
I just saw my name, so--

00:18:07.002 --> 00:18:08.712
Why are you looking at my stuff?

00:18:09.713 --> 00:18:10.631
You're one to talk.

00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:13.759
You read my diary, remember?

00:18:14.468 --> 00:18:16.970
I'm almost at the end,
so I might as well--

00:18:17.471 --> 00:18:18.722
Move.

00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:26.647
I just came across it
while checking my email.

00:18:26.730 --> 00:18:28.774
My phone ran out of juice.

00:18:31.318 --> 00:18:33.445
I was feeling misjudged
for a good minute now,

00:18:34.404 --> 00:18:35.739
so can't I just finish it?

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:40.577
This is just your impression of me.

00:18:44.164 --> 00:18:46.834
I'm not going to do anything with this.
Are we good?

00:18:46.917 --> 00:18:50.462
I recently wrote something about you.
Do you want to read it?

00:18:54.091 --> 00:18:55.968
Come on, aren't you a writer?

00:18:56.468 --> 00:19:00.556
Shouldn’t you be interested
in other people's perspectives?

00:19:00.639 --> 00:19:01.682
Move.

00:19:22.411 --> 00:19:23.996
See?

00:19:25.205 --> 00:19:27.791
I knew you'd be concerned.

00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:31.086
Just quit the cold-hearted act already.

00:19:35.007 --> 00:19:36.341
You're unbelievable!

00:19:39.136 --> 00:19:40.137
Get out.

00:19:44.141 --> 00:19:45.517
Please wait for me downstairs.

00:20:00.032 --> 00:20:01.408
It's on the 28th.

00:20:07.247 --> 00:20:08.498
Before then,

00:20:09.666 --> 00:20:12.377
could you please hear me out just once?

00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:20.135
What about Gangneung, then?

00:20:23.347 --> 00:20:25.057
I thought I'd visit Mom.

00:21:10.852 --> 00:21:11.979
Yes, hello.

00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:14.940
I meant to reach out to you.

00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:17.985
Sure, it's rather complex and heavy,

00:21:19.194 --> 00:21:22.823
but it’s rare to find source material
that is even remotely intriguing.

00:21:22.906 --> 00:21:24.408
I have to agree.

00:21:25.784 --> 00:21:27.202
I need a decision this week.

00:21:27.286 --> 00:21:28.203
I'll do it.

00:21:30.914 --> 00:21:31.957
You will?

00:21:33.875 --> 00:21:36.753
What's the matter?
Isn't it better if I decide quickly?

00:21:39.298 --> 00:21:40.549
Yes, it is,

00:21:41.717 --> 00:21:44.428
but I thought you were still considering
writing that story.

00:21:44.511 --> 00:21:46.179
About you and Ms. Cheon.

00:21:49.433 --> 00:21:50.726
I already told you

00:21:51.435 --> 00:21:53.061
that I don't think I can

00:21:54.062 --> 00:21:55.314
write about that.

00:21:57.941 --> 00:21:59.735
Then what were you doing all this time?

00:21:59.818 --> 00:22:02.571
You ignored my emails and messages
for the past five days.

00:22:04.531 --> 00:22:06.074
I was just dillydallying.

00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:09.745
"Dillydallying"?

00:22:09.828 --> 00:22:10.912
Yes.

00:22:15.167 --> 00:22:17.294
Why did Ms. Cheon ask to meet with you?

00:22:22.049 --> 00:22:23.175
Excuse me.

00:22:28.513 --> 00:22:29.514
Hello?

00:22:32.392 --> 00:22:33.477
Who?

00:22:35.604 --> 00:22:36.730
SWALLOW PICTURES
JIN YU-MI

00:22:36.813 --> 00:22:40.442
I'm sorry I called out of the blue
when we only met briefly yesterday.

00:22:42.486 --> 00:22:43.570
Why exactly did you…

00:22:44.488 --> 00:22:48.033
If you don’t mind me asking,
how do you know Ms.Cheon?

00:22:52.913 --> 00:22:54.122
There's not much to say.

00:23:02.547 --> 00:23:04.633
We were friends when we were kids.

00:23:07.677 --> 00:23:09.721
I got in touch out of frustration.

00:23:10.305 --> 00:23:12.015
I thought you might have answers.

00:23:14.559 --> 00:23:15.394
About what?

00:23:15.477 --> 00:23:16.770
About a month ago,

00:23:17.270 --> 00:23:19.564
she told me to take over the company.

00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:23.902
She said she was moving out of the city,

00:23:23.985 --> 00:23:27.072
but she won't share any further details

00:23:28.156 --> 00:23:29.908
on where or what her plans are.

00:23:32.285 --> 00:23:33.745
If I'm honest,

00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:38.750
I’m worried she might be contemplating
something irreversible.

00:23:41.545 --> 00:23:43.130
"Something irreversible"?

00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:44.881
Suicide.

00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:52.597
What is happening on the 28th?

00:23:54.599 --> 00:23:56.393
I didn’t mean to eavesdrop,

00:23:57.519 --> 00:23:59.146
but surely you know something.

00:24:01.815 --> 00:24:03.024
How serious

00:24:04.192 --> 00:24:06.903
is her condition right now?

00:24:11.116 --> 00:24:12.534
It's very serious.

00:24:16.079 --> 00:24:17.581
What exactly do you mean by--

00:24:17.664 --> 00:24:19.833
Her oncologist says three months at best.

00:24:26.214 --> 00:24:28.842
She said she wanted to stay here
for three days,

00:24:28.925 --> 00:24:31.136
so I dropped her off here yesterday.

00:24:32.387 --> 00:24:34.097
But in a single day, her arm…

00:24:37.601 --> 00:24:38.560
Her arm?

00:24:38.643 --> 00:24:42.314
The cancer's affected her bones,
so the lightest pressure can leave marks.

00:24:43.773 --> 00:24:47.819
She must have bumped it somewhere
without even realizing.

00:24:48.403 --> 00:24:49.571
Move.

00:25:09.090 --> 00:25:12.469
Could you please meet with Ms. Cheon?

00:25:22.187 --> 00:25:23.188
Won't you…

00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:26.858
come with me?

00:25:44.793 --> 00:25:45.794
Take a seat.

00:25:52.968 --> 00:25:54.344
It's nothing, really.

00:25:54.427 --> 00:25:56.179
Just picking up a pen will do this.

00:26:06.856 --> 00:26:07.774
Ms. Jin Yu-mi

00:26:09.484 --> 00:26:10.318
came to see me.

00:26:11.361 --> 00:26:12.654
Have you read it?

00:26:15.991 --> 00:26:17.284
So you haven't.

00:26:20.662 --> 00:26:21.997
You don't have to read it--

00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:24.082
If so, why did you leave it there?

00:26:27.294 --> 00:26:28.878
Does Director Han know

00:26:29.504 --> 00:26:30.589
what you're planning?

00:26:35.135 --> 00:26:36.344
He doesn't, does he?

00:26:38.513 --> 00:26:40.599
You haven't even told your husband.

00:26:41.891 --> 00:26:43.560
What do you expect from me?

00:26:44.269 --> 00:26:45.312
I want us…

00:26:48.773 --> 00:26:50.984
to be friends again.

00:26:56.906 --> 00:26:58.241
-What?
-Eun-jung.

00:27:01.995 --> 00:27:03.204
I'm sick.

00:27:05.332 --> 00:27:06.958
I don't have a lot of time.

00:27:13.006 --> 00:27:14.174
Is being sick a weapon?

00:27:16.468 --> 00:27:17.886
Did you expect me to cry

00:27:18.887 --> 00:27:20.305
when I learned that you were sick?

00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:24.684
I'm sorry for every--

00:27:24.768 --> 00:27:25.894
Don't.

00:27:25.977 --> 00:27:28.146
I'm not here to hear your apology.

00:27:30.315 --> 00:27:31.483
Ms. Yu-mi is

00:27:32.859 --> 00:27:34.986
worried that you might die.

00:27:35.779 --> 00:27:37.113
That you might kill yourself.

00:27:38.823 --> 00:27:40.408
So tell them the truth.

00:27:41.576 --> 00:27:43.912
Both Ms. Yu-mi and Director Han.

00:27:45.664 --> 00:27:47.165
I came here to tell you that.

00:27:48.792 --> 00:27:49.793
Eun-jung.

00:27:50.543 --> 00:27:51.961
Eun-jung, just this once…

00:27:53.046 --> 00:27:54.214
Eun-jung, please.

00:28:35.088 --> 00:28:36.089
Seriously!

00:28:37.048 --> 00:28:38.550
-I'm sorry.
-Sorry, ma'am.

00:28:38.633 --> 00:28:39.467
It's fine.

00:28:39.551 --> 00:28:41.511
Seriously, what's wrong with you?

00:28:51.813 --> 00:28:53.189
Mom, I'm home.

00:28:54.941 --> 00:28:56.651
Why didn't you call?

00:28:56.735 --> 00:28:58.653
Today is Parents' Day, Mother.

00:29:02.657 --> 00:29:03.658
Here you go.

00:29:04.492 --> 00:29:06.870
Oh my. I hope you were feeling generous.

00:29:09.456 --> 00:29:11.875
Why are you eating noodles
instead of rice?

00:29:13.418 --> 00:29:16.171
The side-dish-shop auntie
brought some kimchi the other day

00:29:16.254 --> 00:29:18.381
and said that she craved
my hand-torn noodles.

00:29:18.465 --> 00:29:20.925
They're leftovers.
Would you like some? There's more.

00:29:21.676 --> 00:29:23.511
-I already had lunch.
-Right.

00:29:24.179 --> 00:29:25.805
Has Sang-yeon been in touch yet?

00:29:29.517 --> 00:29:30.351
Why would she?

00:29:30.935 --> 00:29:32.270
Well, the side-dish auntie

00:29:32.353 --> 00:29:34.939
showed me a clip
of someone mentioning you on TV,

00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:36.649
and it was Sang-yeon.

00:29:39.694 --> 00:29:42.489
She's unbelievable, that girl.
How unnecessary.

00:29:43.072 --> 00:29:45.033
-Where are you going?
-To wash my hands.

00:29:52.165 --> 00:29:54.417
Message Auntie to thank her.

00:29:54.501 --> 00:29:55.543
Sure.

00:29:55.627 --> 00:29:58.880
And if Sang-yeon does reach out,
you should just forgive her.

00:30:02.801 --> 00:30:04.135
What's with you?

00:30:06.679 --> 00:30:08.431
Why are you telling me to forgive her?

00:30:08.932 --> 00:30:12.185
Why are you saying things
when you don't even know the full story?

00:30:14.813 --> 00:30:15.814
I know.

00:30:16.356 --> 00:30:17.774
I know she did you wrong.

00:30:19.150 --> 00:30:20.026
What do you mean?

00:30:20.527 --> 00:30:21.778
How would you know that?

00:30:22.612 --> 00:30:24.322
Sang-yeon came to see me.

00:30:24.405 --> 00:30:26.533
She said she was a bitch but wanted a hug.

00:30:28.159 --> 00:30:29.160
When?

00:30:30.119 --> 00:30:32.580
Maybe about six months
before you left your job?

00:30:33.081 --> 00:30:35.542
When you were making trips
to Gangneung for that movie.

00:30:38.837 --> 00:30:41.297
So? What did you tell her?

00:30:41.381 --> 00:30:43.675
What do you mean? She just wanted a hug.

00:30:44.259 --> 00:30:45.301
So you hugged her?

00:30:46.469 --> 00:30:47.470
Of course I did.

00:30:48.805 --> 00:30:51.724
Why would you hug her
when she admitted she's a bitch?

00:30:52.308 --> 00:30:55.144
She was standing there,
unable to even look me in the eye.

00:30:55.645 --> 00:30:57.647
I couldn't help but feel for her.

00:30:59.107 --> 00:31:01.568
I told her to come again,
but I knew she wouldn't.

00:31:01.651 --> 00:31:03.653
You being like this is why I…

00:31:04.779 --> 00:31:05.655
Why you what?

00:31:08.283 --> 00:31:09.284
Whatever.

00:31:09.909 --> 00:31:11.661
Remember what you always told me?

00:31:11.744 --> 00:31:15.748
You said mistakes can be forgiven,
but intentionally hurting others is wrong.

00:31:15.832 --> 00:31:17.417
What she did to me was deliberate!

00:31:19.627 --> 00:31:22.630
Keep hating her, then.
That's enough reason for you to hate her.

00:31:22.714 --> 00:31:24.549
I don't hate her. I dislike her.

00:31:24.632 --> 00:31:25.842
That's the same thing.

00:31:25.925 --> 00:31:26.843
It's different.

00:31:53.328 --> 00:31:54.495
What are you doing?

00:31:57.457 --> 00:31:58.750
I'm sorry for everything.

00:31:59.876 --> 00:32:01.127
I told you, didn't I?

00:32:01.711 --> 00:32:03.254
I don't want your apology…

00:32:14.849 --> 00:32:16.768
Why are you being so stubborn?

00:32:20.146 --> 00:32:21.481
I want to apologize.

00:32:21.564 --> 00:32:23.816
You apologizing now changes nothing.

00:32:25.693 --> 00:32:26.736
Are you doing this

00:32:27.445 --> 00:32:30.365
because you genuinely believe
I'll make that trip with you?

00:32:31.699 --> 00:32:33.534
You have a husband.

00:32:34.535 --> 00:32:37.372
If you insist on going,
go tell Director Han.

00:32:38.331 --> 00:32:39.540
It's not like that.

00:32:39.624 --> 00:32:41.209
Then why are you doing all this?

00:32:42.919 --> 00:32:44.462
Because you're still here.

00:32:50.093 --> 00:32:52.178
I never got the chance

00:32:52.679 --> 00:32:54.222
with my mom or my brother…

00:32:57.350 --> 00:32:58.518
To apologize.

00:33:06.234 --> 00:33:07.610
I can still tell you

00:33:08.611 --> 00:33:10.071
that I'm sorry.

00:33:21.374 --> 00:33:22.208
Tell me.

00:33:25.086 --> 00:33:27.296
When you were thriving and still healthy…

00:33:29.966 --> 00:33:31.384
did you ever think of me?

00:33:35.596 --> 00:33:38.850
When your films were breaking
all sorts of box office records

00:33:39.434 --> 00:33:41.602
or when you were partying
and buying buildings…

00:33:44.313 --> 00:33:45.982
did you feel guilt for what you did?

00:33:53.489 --> 00:33:55.366
Don't you think it's a bit late for this?

00:33:59.037 --> 00:34:00.747
If you truly wanted to apologize,

00:34:01.706 --> 00:34:03.291
you should have done it back then.

00:34:05.877 --> 00:34:08.129
Back when I could still blame you.

00:34:10.965 --> 00:34:12.258
Before you fell ill.

00:34:16.262 --> 00:34:17.138
You…

00:34:19.599 --> 00:34:21.225
You're a real bitch.

00:34:36.824 --> 00:34:38.159
If it hadn't come to this,

00:34:38.242 --> 00:34:39.869
I could never have come here.

00:34:42.330 --> 00:34:45.041
Because apologizing isn't nearly enough
for what I did.

00:34:50.630 --> 00:34:53.007
I wish I had liked you wholeheartedly…

00:34:55.676 --> 00:34:56.844
but I didn't.

00:35:05.853 --> 00:35:06.854
I also hated you,

00:35:08.481 --> 00:35:09.565
and I'm sorry for that.

00:36:30.396 --> 00:36:31.480
Hi, Hui-jin.

00:36:31.564 --> 00:36:33.608
Jesus, you saw it too, right?

00:36:33.691 --> 00:36:35.943
What's gotten into Cheon Sang-yeon?

00:36:36.986 --> 00:36:38.321
That's old news.

00:36:38.988 --> 00:36:41.115
You're the 100th person to remind me.

00:36:41.199 --> 00:36:43.576
Really? But I read it just now.

00:36:45.453 --> 00:36:46.746
You read what just now?

00:36:48.289 --> 00:36:49.582
MY START WAS A LIE

00:36:53.544 --> 00:36:56.797
CEO CHEON OF SWALLOW PICTURES
REACHED OUT FOR AN INTERVIEW

00:36:57.632 --> 00:36:59.467
THERE IS SOMETHING I MUST SAY…

00:36:59.550 --> 00:37:02.470
SOMEONE ELSE DEVELOPED THE SCREENPLAY
OF ECHOES OF SUMMER…

00:37:02.553 --> 00:37:04.931
IT HAS WEIGHED ON MY HEART
FOR A VERY LONG TIME

00:37:09.936 --> 00:37:12.063
ALTHOUGH IT IS LATE,
I WISH TO RIGHT MY WRONGS

00:37:12.146 --> 00:37:13.940
"Right my wrongs," she says.

00:37:14.523 --> 00:37:16.651
Why is she suddenly seeking penance?

00:37:19.737 --> 00:37:21.197
Perhaps her time has come.

00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:23.115
She's definitely lost the plot.

00:37:27.203 --> 00:37:29.413
-Did you run the dirt road?
-Yes.

00:37:29.497 --> 00:37:33.042
You're right about running on dirt roads.
I should have moved here sooner.

00:37:36.462 --> 00:37:37.630
How do you feel?

00:37:40.424 --> 00:37:43.761
About all that crap Cheon Sang-yeon said
at the Baeksang Awards.

00:37:49.517 --> 00:37:50.601
She said she was sorry.

00:37:51.727 --> 00:37:53.938
When? Did you meet her?

00:37:55.481 --> 00:37:56.315
Yes.

00:37:56.816 --> 00:37:59.568
You're nuts.
Why would you give her the chance?

00:38:01.404 --> 00:38:03.155
She sure is shameless.

00:38:03.239 --> 00:38:06.659
If she saw you back then,
she wouldn't have been able to apologize.

00:38:06.742 --> 00:38:09.495
If not for her,
you would still be in the film industry.

00:38:09.578 --> 00:38:11.372
Come on, that's a stretch.

00:38:12.123 --> 00:38:15.543
I prefer TV anyway.
I'm glad I got out when I did.

00:38:17.169 --> 00:38:18.587
She should lose everything.

00:38:19.297 --> 00:38:20.923
I wonder when it'll ever happen.

00:38:21.882 --> 00:38:23.843
You don't have to hate her too.

00:38:23.926 --> 00:38:25.261
Oh, but I want to.

00:38:26.595 --> 00:38:28.139
Whenever I think about back then…

00:38:32.101 --> 00:38:34.186
Sang-yeon's sick.

00:38:38.941 --> 00:38:39.942
How?

00:38:43.779 --> 00:38:46.574
Why, is it something serious?

00:38:48.075 --> 00:38:48.909
Yes.

00:38:54.415 --> 00:38:55.958
But I'm not going to dwell on it.

00:38:57.126 --> 00:38:58.210
Good.

00:38:59.045 --> 00:39:00.963
Don't concern yourself with her.

00:39:01.464 --> 00:39:03.215
She’ll manage just fine on her own.

00:39:08.763 --> 00:39:11.724
She is still happily married
to Director Han Jae-jun, right?

00:39:15.728 --> 00:39:19.231
You've really been out of the loop
in the film scene, haven't you?

00:39:34.246 --> 00:39:35.289
They got divorced?

00:39:38.125 --> 00:39:40.002
It’s been about three years now, I think.

00:39:46.008 --> 00:39:47.093
I see.

00:39:48.094 --> 00:39:50.137
Hey, getting divorced is nothing.

00:39:52.264 --> 00:39:54.100
Does she have any siblings?

00:39:55.267 --> 00:39:56.936
Right, she's an only child.

00:40:00.523 --> 00:40:03.275
Yeah, she's alone.

00:40:46.944 --> 00:40:48.446
To me, life is like…

00:40:52.533 --> 00:40:54.785
a box that I cannot bear to open.

00:40:58.706 --> 00:41:00.291
Now, looking back on my life…

00:41:02.751 --> 00:41:04.962
I am left with just a few names.

00:41:07.756 --> 00:41:08.841
Yoon Hyun-sook,

00:41:10.551 --> 00:41:11.677
Cheon Sang-hak…

00:41:14.138 --> 00:41:15.347
and…

00:41:18.058 --> 00:41:19.185
Ryu Eun-jung.

00:41:26.984 --> 00:41:28.819
I remember the one time

00:41:29.487 --> 00:41:31.405
my mother spanked me.

00:41:31.489 --> 00:41:33.365
I did it because the teacher told me to.

00:41:33.449 --> 00:41:34.450
Palms out.

00:41:39.330 --> 00:41:40.623
It felt so unfair.

00:41:40.706 --> 00:41:43.792
It hurts, doesn't it?
Being struck hurts like that.

00:41:44.460 --> 00:41:46.879
Didn't it occur to you
that it would hurt your friend?

00:41:46.962 --> 00:41:48.923
I just did what I was told to do!

00:41:50.591 --> 00:41:53.636
But then Ryu Eun-jung told me…

00:41:53.719 --> 00:41:55.596
Do you know how much this would hurt?

00:41:56.680 --> 00:41:58.474
This is harder than wood.

00:42:02.269 --> 00:42:03.562
That's when I knew.

00:42:04.146 --> 00:42:05.814
That's when I sensed

00:42:06.315 --> 00:42:09.109
that I could never beat her.

00:42:11.153 --> 00:42:12.488
Three, two, one!

00:42:12.571 --> 00:42:15.157
Everyone liked Eun-jung.

00:42:15.658 --> 00:42:16.951
Peace signs?

00:42:17.034 --> 00:42:19.370
-And, to be honest…
-Three, two, one!

00:42:20.287 --> 00:42:21.247
I liked her too.

00:42:23.541 --> 00:42:25.000
-Let's take one together.
-What?

00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:28.003
Let's huddle up.

00:42:28.712 --> 00:42:32.007
I wish I had liked her wholeheartedly.

00:42:32.091 --> 00:42:35.135
Ms. Yoon! Hello.

00:42:35.219 --> 00:42:36.095
Oh my, Eun-jung!

00:42:36.178 --> 00:42:38.806
It's been so long. Give me a hug.

00:42:40.975 --> 00:42:42.101
But I also hated her.

00:42:43.727 --> 00:42:45.187
Well done.

00:42:45.271 --> 00:42:48.732
You two excel in your studies
because you were both born smart.

00:42:49.233 --> 00:42:52.861
That's why you should never believe
your good grades make you special.

00:42:53.904 --> 00:42:55.739
Because with what I had,

00:42:56.991 --> 00:42:59.702
I could never bring joy to my mom…

00:43:04.206 --> 00:43:07.585
nor make my brother smile.

00:43:12.339 --> 00:43:13.757
But despite all that…

00:43:16.969 --> 00:43:17.970
Eun-jung.

00:43:18.470 --> 00:43:21.015
…you were the only one I had.

00:43:21.098 --> 00:43:22.099
Sang-yeon.

00:43:31.984 --> 00:43:34.028
But you didn't know.

00:43:37.656 --> 00:43:38.866
You didn't know

00:43:39.450 --> 00:43:41.076
what that meant to me.

00:43:43.537 --> 00:43:45.080
When did he give this to you?

00:43:47.291 --> 00:43:49.043
The day I slept over at your house.

00:43:58.427 --> 00:44:00.429
I thought it was because of me.

00:44:02.723 --> 00:44:04.933
I believed my brother's death
was my fault…

00:44:07.311 --> 00:44:10.898
which is why he left
without saying a word to me.

00:44:21.283 --> 00:44:22.117
Sang-yeon.

00:44:26.664 --> 00:44:27.539
Can I ask

00:44:29.416 --> 00:44:33.420
why you didn't tell me
you were moving back then?

00:44:36.298 --> 00:44:38.717
Were you upset with me or something?

00:44:42.137 --> 00:44:43.347
It was all because

00:44:44.932 --> 00:44:46.100
I had never been

00:44:46.684 --> 00:44:48.852
loved like you.

00:44:54.024 --> 00:44:55.943
I believe these have been…

00:44:57.945 --> 00:45:01.782
some of the toughest years of your life.

00:45:04.952 --> 00:45:07.454
I'm so glad
we reconnected during this time

00:45:08.497 --> 00:45:11.875
and that I can be of any help,
no matter how small.

00:45:16.839 --> 00:45:20.050
Because I could never be like you.

00:45:22.845 --> 00:45:24.930
Because I did not know how to give

00:45:26.140 --> 00:45:28.058
nor how to receive unconditionally.

00:45:30.185 --> 00:45:32.187
That's why both my feelings of affection

00:45:33.939 --> 00:45:35.190
and hatred toward you…

00:45:37.401 --> 00:45:39.945
were all too much for me to bear.

00:45:43.574 --> 00:45:45.159
So I destroyed us instead…

00:45:47.536 --> 00:45:49.455
because I wanted to destroy you.

00:45:50.914 --> 00:45:52.541
I hate that you're fine.

00:45:54.168 --> 00:45:56.795
Because I wanted to destroy myself.

00:45:57.504 --> 00:45:59.757
I want to see you ruined, like me.

00:46:19.359 --> 00:46:21.111
It had been hard for me too.

00:46:21.904 --> 00:46:23.781
I don't hate her. I just dislike her.

00:46:23.864 --> 00:46:24.948
That's the same thing.

00:46:25.032 --> 00:46:25.866
It's different.

00:46:26.950 --> 00:46:30.120
Disliking someone is easy
because they rarely cross your mind,

00:46:30.204 --> 00:46:32.289
but hating someone means they linger.

00:46:45.052 --> 00:46:46.637
Let's pay Ms. Yoon a visit.

00:46:47.930 --> 00:46:49.556
I'm not doing this for you.

00:46:50.474 --> 00:46:51.975
I'm doing this for me.

00:46:57.189 --> 00:46:58.357
What's the matter, ma'am?

00:47:01.527 --> 00:47:02.653
I'm just glad.

00:47:09.117 --> 00:47:10.953
I hope it doesn't rain.

00:47:19.211 --> 00:47:21.755
CANCER PATIENT TRAVEL PRECAUTIONS

00:47:21.839 --> 00:47:25.259
WHAT SHOULD CANCER PATIENTS
WATCH OUT FOR WHEN TRAVELING?

00:47:28.971 --> 00:47:30.806
FOODS GOOD FOR CANCER PATIENTS

00:47:49.700 --> 00:47:50.909
I'm heading out now.

00:47:51.410 --> 00:47:53.287
I'll call you when I arrive.

00:47:54.162 --> 00:47:55.497
CHEON SANG-YEON: OKAY!

00:48:20.439 --> 00:48:22.649
CHEON SANG-YEON

00:49:06.026 --> 00:49:08.320
Ma'am! What's going on?

00:49:08.403 --> 00:49:10.447
She collapsed and stopped breathing.

00:49:10.530 --> 00:49:12.908
I'll go. My number's on my car window.

00:49:14.785 --> 00:49:15.786
Sang-yeon!

00:49:17.079 --> 00:49:20.165
42-year-old female,
unconscious, en route now.

00:49:20.248 --> 00:49:23.502
Patient only responding to pain stimuli
and has terminal cancer…

00:49:27.089 --> 00:49:29.007
Her blood pressure is at 150…

00:49:30.634 --> 00:49:32.636
Please don't die. I beg you.

00:49:36.890 --> 00:49:37.891
Cheon Sang-yeon.

00:53:03.096 --> 00:53:08.101
