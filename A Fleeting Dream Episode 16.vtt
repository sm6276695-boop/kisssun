00:01:08.839 --> 00:01:10.919
Xinruo, hold me tight!

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.358
Pei Yuze, why am I here?

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:15.279
Stop talking and hold me tight.

00:01:17.319 --> 00:01:18.279
Don't let go!

00:01:18.559 --> 00:01:19.759
Yuze!

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:25.279
Xinruo!

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:32.719
Xinruo.

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:38.199
Second Master.

00:01:46.279 --> 00:01:47.319
Xinruo.

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:49.999
Have some ginger soup.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.440
No thanks.

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.320
I don't feel like eating.

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:13.719
Do you remember

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.040
what happened?

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.200
Come with me, okay?

00:02:22.279 --> 00:02:23.879
Don't leave me alone.

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:28.879
Not at all.

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:31.279
I just remember I had a dream.

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:32.879
Then

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.360
when I came round,

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.400
I was in midair.

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:39.639
Could it be schizophrenia?

00:02:40.119 --> 00:02:41.759
Xinruo suffers from schizophrenia?

00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:45.359
But I hadn't had a relapse

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.360
ever since Pei Yujie's death.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.760
Besides, I never had

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:51.959
such a serious relapse before.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:10.720
I'm alright.

00:03:21.039 --> 00:03:21.959
Xinruo.

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:25.359
That wasn't a relapse.
There's something wrong with this incense.

00:03:29.279 --> 00:03:31.479
This isn't the mind-calming incense
that I usually use.

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:33.399
Though they smell similar,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.600
I'm sure they've been swapped.

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.160
I bet someone was in here

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:40.600
when you were asleep.

00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:42.799
(Could it be Wu Peirong?)

00:03:43.119 --> 00:03:44.479
I'll send someone to look into that.

00:03:50.359 --> 00:03:52.039
Where have you been at this late hour?

00:03:52.119 --> 00:03:53.038
I...

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:54.159
Jin Se

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:56.118
has gone missing.

00:03:56.119 --> 00:03:56.879
Jin Se?

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:57.959
Calm down.

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:59.360
I've asked Wen Yuan to look for her.

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:00.760
She fights well,

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:02.240
so she should be safe.

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.440
How crafty they are.

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:06.879
They lured Jin Se away

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:08.039
and kidnapped you.

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.280
And now they pulled all this trick
in hospital without us knowing.

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:12.960
That should be Wu Peirong's doing.

00:04:13.119 --> 00:04:14.598
But he's plotting something

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:15.679
behind our back.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.078
What do we do?

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:18.079
Unless...

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:22.519
we lure him out.

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.558
You can't blame for the failure. It was...

00:04:35.559 --> 00:04:37.239
I told you to get rid of Pei Yuze,

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:38.600
not to hurt Xinruo!

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.160
They killed Mr. Pei.

00:04:44.279 --> 00:04:45.879
I'm going to avenge him!

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.960
If you want
to leave Hu City in one piece,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.960
you'd better do as I say.

00:04:52.799 --> 00:04:54.319
Following the failure,

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:55.959
I can't expose myself.

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.680
What can I do now?

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:02.680
What's this?

00:05:03.079 --> 00:05:05.719
I want to see
Pei Yuze breathing his last.

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:16.060
(Pei Residence)

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:18.999
I've looked into all

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.240
who accessed the residence.

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:21.680
None of them is suspicious.

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.999
Haven't the police received any news
regarding Wu Peirong?

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.358
You suspect Wu Peirong
is behind all this?

00:05:28.359 --> 00:05:30.118
Wu Peirong is the only one

00:05:30.119 --> 00:05:32.719
who sees us as nemeses
and has tried to get rid of us.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.120
Xinruo, rest assured.

00:05:34.359 --> 00:05:35.719
I'll have my men look into that.

00:05:39.599 --> 00:05:40.719
Yuze!

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:41.558
Uncle Yuze!

00:05:41.559 --> 00:05:42.879
Where's the medicine? Where...

00:05:49.039 --> 00:05:50.039
Yuze!

00:05:50.359 --> 00:05:52.318
Butler! Butler!

00:05:52.319 --> 00:05:53.959
Quick, let's send him to hospital!

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:00.120
Traces of the venom were found
in his body.

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:02.920
Fortunately, it was nothing serious.
And he was sent here in no time.

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:04.039
He's out of danger now.

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:05.280
Venom?

00:06:06.359 --> 00:06:07.639
Thank you, Doctor.

00:06:09.359 --> 00:06:11.319
That's great! Uncle Yuze is all fine.

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:16.840
Yao, what's the matter?

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:21.960
I was wondering why Uncle Yuze
was poisoned.

00:06:23.079 --> 00:06:26.439
Jiang Yao. There have been misfortunes
in the Pei Residence.

00:06:26.519 --> 00:06:30.079
As the head, you should look into it.

00:06:30.319 --> 00:06:31.639
Xinruo, don't worry.

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:33.200
I won't let them get away with it.

00:06:35.319 --> 00:06:36.359
I'm glad to hear that.

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:38.960
Xinruo, we're off, then.

00:06:40.319 --> 00:06:41.639
Yao, let's go.

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:49.300
(Pei Residence)

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:53.679
How can he be so lucky?

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:55.758
Even the poison failed to kill him.

00:06:55.759 --> 00:06:57.038
Impossible.

00:06:57.039 --> 00:06:59.119
He did take the soup!

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:00.118
How did he survive

00:07:00.119 --> 00:07:02.119
such a big dosage?

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:07.038
I told you not to beat around the bush.

00:07:07.039 --> 00:07:09.439
I'll head to hospital
and get rid of him now.

00:07:10.359 --> 00:07:13.239
I'll kick him when he's down.

00:07:20.799 --> 00:07:22.039
Could it be

00:07:23.319 --> 00:07:24.919
he wasn't poisoned at all?

00:07:27.319 --> 00:07:28.279
This is bad!

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:51.240
Don't move! Put the knife down!

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:52.840
Put the knife down!

00:08:02.279 --> 00:08:03.559
Pei Yuze.

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:06.239
Why weren't you poisoned?

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:07.840
Who said I was poisoned?

00:08:08.179 --> 00:08:10.700
Was it someone from the Pei family
who has been in cahoots with you?

00:08:11.799 --> 00:08:13.159
Someone from the Pei family?

00:08:13.519 --> 00:08:14.679
I tried to kill you

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:16.719
to avenge Mr. Pei.

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:18.718
Come clean

00:08:18.719 --> 00:08:20.799
and we'll consider sparing your life.

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:26.718
What do you want to know?

00:08:26.719 --> 00:08:28.719
Who in the Pei family
is good at making poisons?

00:08:28.759 --> 00:08:29.879
Making poisons?

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:31.599
How would I know that?

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:33.640
Who in the Pei family
has been in cahoots with you?

00:08:38.199 --> 00:08:39.359
Him?

00:08:41.679 --> 00:08:43.799
Wu Peirong? Why is he here?

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:47.040
Why are you here?

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:48.879
I got worried

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:49.960
because you weren't home yet.

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:51.680
We're asking Wu Peirong

00:08:51.799 --> 00:08:55.279
who in the Pei family
he's in cahoots with.

00:08:55.719 --> 00:08:57.679
Wu Peirong, speak!

00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:59.560
Is anyone from the Pei family
in cahoots with you?

00:09:00.159 --> 00:09:01.919
I bought one of the bodyguards off.

00:09:02.319 --> 00:09:04.559
I can tell you about him.

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:06.879
What about Jin Se? Where is she?

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:08.400
I don't know.

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:09.520
You're lying.

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:12.158
I just had my man lure her away.

00:09:12.159 --> 00:09:15.079
And she ended up getting lost
in the woods.

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:15.758
You...

00:09:15.759 --> 00:09:17.279
Since you refuse to cooperate with us...

00:09:17.639 --> 00:09:19.919
Wen Yuan,
send him to the police station.

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:22.360
They have many tricks
to make him tell the truth.

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:23.640
Yes, Second Master.

00:09:24.319 --> 00:09:25.239
Move!

00:09:28.199 --> 00:09:29.400
Don't try anything funny!

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:33.820
(Pei Residence)

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:42.000
Thanks.

00:09:47.719 --> 00:09:49.199
Are you really alright?

00:09:51.279 --> 00:09:52.239
Don't worry.

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:55.920
Ordinary poisons don't work on me.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.599
By the right, what Wu Peirong said...

00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:00.280
It was almost unbelievable.

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:04.079
Besides, Jiang Yao showed up
at a perfect timing.

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:05.600
So you mean

00:10:05.759 --> 00:10:09.159
Wu Peirong has something
to do with Jiang Yao.

00:10:09.279 --> 00:10:10.679
We can't be sure yet.

00:10:12.359 --> 00:10:13.640
Let's see if Wu Peirong

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.280
can give us what we want.

00:10:28.639 --> 00:10:29.638
How's it?

00:10:29.639 --> 00:10:32.399
Master Jiang, Wu Peirong
said nothing yesterday.

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:33.480
However...

00:10:34.239 --> 00:10:35.119
What?

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.480
He was taken away this early morning.

00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:44.560
Got it.

00:10:47.759 --> 00:10:49.159
What happened?

00:10:49.799 --> 00:10:51.319
Wu Peirong has been taken away.

00:10:51.359 --> 00:10:52.520
By whom?

00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:54.160
We couldn't figure that out.

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:55.720
He must be

00:10:56.319 --> 00:10:58.679
hiding something from us.

00:11:00.719 --> 00:11:04.159
You almost ruined our plan
by trying to kill Pei Yuze on your own.

00:11:06.319 --> 00:11:07.678
That useless Pei Yuze

00:11:07.679 --> 00:11:09.079
thinks he can get the best of me.

00:11:10.159 --> 00:11:12.218
I'll take the ferry to Japan tonight.

00:11:12.218 --> 00:11:14.999
Once Hu City and the national chamber
of commerce are under your control,

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.040
I'll be back

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:18.080
to teach that shameless couple
a good lesson

00:11:18.239 --> 00:11:19.719
and avenge Mr. Pei!

00:11:22.159 --> 00:11:23.439
You haven't told anyone

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:25.280
about our deal, have you?

00:11:25.679 --> 00:11:26.639
Rest assured.

00:11:27.159 --> 00:11:28.798
You've saved me twice.

00:11:28.799 --> 00:11:30.638
My lips are sealed.

00:11:30.639 --> 00:11:31.639
Is that so?

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:34.320
If it hadn't been for me,

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:36.800
I'm afraid
you'd have come clean to the police.

00:11:39.719 --> 00:11:40.879
Because I believed

00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:42.999
you'd get me out of there.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.840
I said those words to stall them.

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:47.400
I'm glad to hear that.

00:11:50.719 --> 00:11:51.919
The ferry is leaving soon.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:52.960
I need to go now.

00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:16.680
You

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.600
actually...

00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:41.200
