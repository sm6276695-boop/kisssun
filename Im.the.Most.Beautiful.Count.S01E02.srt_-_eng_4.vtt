00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:28.770
I'm being serious.

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.480
Where exactly am I?

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:32.060
You woke up raving mad, huh?

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:33.600
Might as well have stayed dead.

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:34.990
Jade, who was that man?

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:36.240
That’s Lord Kosol, sir.

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.479
The one rumored to be close with the Count.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:39.660
My dear brother...

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:43.039
Why have you changed so much?

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.100
You're not the man I used to know.

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.710
Then let me help jog your memory.

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.330
So you're the one who found my body.

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.880
Then tell me…who was the one I loved?

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.630
And who was the one who broke my heart?

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:07.430
If you know anything about me,

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.190
you need to tell me right now.

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.120
Of course.

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.260
I want to know who my true love was.

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:15.580
And finally find out

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.200
what really happened to me.

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.190
If I remember anything,
I’ll tell you right away.

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:24.440
For now, please get back on the boat.

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.960
If the Lord sees you,
we’ll be in trouble.

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.829
Then I’ll go for now. See you soon.

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:32.440
Row carefully.

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.829
That guy with the glasses...

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.760
Feels like he's hiding something.

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.210
Or maybe it’s him…

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.540
maybe he’s the one dating Worradej.

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:44.710
Banjong.

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:52.800
Worradej.

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.430
What do you think you're doing?

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:56.480
Oh, please.

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.310
That was nothing
compared to what you just did.

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.400
If someone had seen us...

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.270
we could’ve been jailed.

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.260
For expressing a gender identity
that doesn't match our birth sex.

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.380
You know the law better than anyone.

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:09.870
Huh?

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.210
Just two men kissing on the cheek...

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.480
and we’d get thrown in jail?

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.120
I thought it’d just be a fine or something.

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:18.870
An offense this serious…

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:20.210
it means prison, no exceptions.

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.940
Besides, we’re just friends, nothing more.

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:25.490
You can't show affection like that toward me.

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:29.920
I'm sorry.

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.200
I was only messing with you, that’s all.

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.800
Don’t be mad at me, Banjong.

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:38.540
Please?

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.730
Just don’t do that again, alright?

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:43.910
Alrighty.

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:46.650
I’m heading off.

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:48.690
Alright then.

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.030
Wait, so they’re not dating?

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.000
Then that means...

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:56.800
Worradej’s boyfriend...

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.310
is that creepy Kosol guy?

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.880
Ugh, how could anyone like him?

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:03.660
He’s terrifying.

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:12.340
As of now...

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.400
someone is secretly trying to kill me.

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:16.760
And I know...

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:18.870
they're hiding among you.

00:04:18.899 --> 00:04:21.649
If anyone has a lead,
report to me at once.

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:25.310
And if that person is listening…
drop your plan now.

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.710
Because if I bleed even a single drop...

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:30.190
my brother Kosol

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.040
will cut your head off on the spot.

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:35.200
Just like that petty thief
who died in the woods yesterday.

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.400
But if you all take good care of me,

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.300
I’ll reward every one
of you with a little bonus.

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:07.600
My Lord.

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:09.240
What are you looking for, sir?

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:10.890
You’ve been searching forever.

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:12.590
I’m just poking around, really.

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:15.080
Hoping I might find something
about the one I loved.

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:18.590
And yesterday when Kosol kidnapped you

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:20.300
did you get anything out of it, sir?

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:23.180
Kosol said he had no real issue with me.

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.880
So that can't be
the reason I tried to end my life.

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:30.220
Now that I know that...
I’m even more confused.

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:40.430
You’re the sun,
I’m the moon, in the vast sky.

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:44.970
In the day, I shine while you drift away.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.470
When I fade,
you return to light the night.

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:53.970
And so it goes, unchanged, for all time.

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:56.690
Jade.

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:59.760
Do you know what kind of relationship
I had with Lord Banjong?

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:01.520
You and Lord Banjong...

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:04.010
worked for the Lord together for years.

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:05.990
You two were quite close, sir.

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:07.700
Why do you ask?

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.330
Well, this poem…

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:12.520
Banjong recited it to me last night.

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:15.190
And when I looked like
I didn’t remember it,

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:16.920
he seemed kinda sulky.

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:18.950
Then I found the same poem in this drawer.

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:21.530
So I think...

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:24.760
this must be a love letter
Banjong wrote to me.

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:26.920
I kinda wanna know...

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:29.360
Lord Banjong being your lover...

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:31.810
I honestly never saw that coming, sir.

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:35.030
Jade.

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:37.510
Take me to Lord Banjong’s house, please.

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:45.180
Worradej.

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:47.120
Worradej, you bastard.

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:01.450
Is Worradej in his room?

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:02.980
No, sir. He’s not.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.090
Then where did he go?

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:05.200
I truly don’t know, sir.

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:06.500
Tch…damn it.

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:08.550
How can you not know where your master is?

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:09.990
You want a whipping?

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:11.300
No, sir.

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:13.000
I really haven’t seen him.

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:15.230
I’m out looking for him too, sir.

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:17.580
You lying to me?

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:23.600
Where are you off to, sir?

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:25.410
Your Lordship, he’s not in his room.

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:28.210
Out of my way.

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:51.400
If you find him,

00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:54.050
tell him to get his ass back
and help me work.

00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:55.810
Do something useful for once.

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:58.270
So the villagers stop
talking crap behind his back.

00:07:58.300 --> 00:07:59.920
Yes, Your Lordship.

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:07.900
Oh, and tell him one more thing…

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:10.380
tone down the whole queen act.

00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:12.890
Or I’ll beat it out of him myself.

00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:14.230
Yes, sir.

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:23.010
Sir.

00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:25.390
Are you... really okay?

00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:37.320
Here it is…Lord Banjong’s residence.

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:39.880
- Let’s just go inside.
- Uh...

00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:42.320
Maybe we should call out first, sir.

00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:44.200
If you barge in uninvited,

00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:46.670
he might think we’re burglars.

00:08:47.530 --> 00:08:48.760
Wait.

00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:51.200
Let’s just go in.

00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:53.220
We might find something good.

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:02.430
Jade.

00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:04.000
Do those two know each other?

00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:06.130
It’s my first time seeing them together, sir.

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:07.590
That’s real strange.

00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:10.440
The Count’s basically top-tier nobility.

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:14.450
And Kosol’s basically
one step from being a criminal.

00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:16.750
How the hell did those two get close?

00:09:19.270 --> 00:09:20.860
Let’s move in a little closer.

00:09:20.890 --> 00:09:22.630
Can’t hear a thing from here.

00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:35.260
What are you two up to?

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.930
Is anyone home?

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:44.600
I’m here to see Lord Banjong, that’s all.

00:09:48.810 --> 00:09:50.640
I wasn’t eavesdropping.

00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:53.290
The door was already open...

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:55.550
so I just walked in, that’s all.

00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:57.920
Then I saw the two of you talking,

00:09:57.940 --> 00:09:59.940
so I just stood here waiting.

00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:02.600
I caught you red-handed eavesdropping…

00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:03.860
and you’re still making excuses?

00:10:03.890 --> 00:10:05.040
I’m not making excuses.

00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:08.190
I’m just explaining what happened.

00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:12.390
Don’t push my patience.

00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:14.450
You still owe me one case.

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:17.710
Who gave you permission
to escape last night?

00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:20.340
I haven’t even finished interrogating you.

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:23.280
And who gave you permission to lock me up?

00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:25.910
If you didn’t wait for me to allow it,

00:10:25.930 --> 00:10:29.570
then I don’t need
your permission to escape either.

00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:32.660
You dare talk back to me now, Worradej?

00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:34.510
Damn right I do, Kosol.

00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:35.680
Enough.

00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:37.870
Stop bickering over nonsense.

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:43.280
Worradej.

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:44.990
So why did you come to see me?

00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:46.920
Whatever it is, say it now.

00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:48.680
Well...

00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:51.420
I’d like to stay at your place,
Lord Banjong.

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:52.550
What for?

00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:55.600
Your house is huge
why come live in mine?

00:10:57.660 --> 00:10:59.360
And who’s this?

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:02.720
I’m Pandao, Lord Banjong’s sister.

00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:04.800
I heard your memory’s not
what it used to be,

00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:06.630
but I didn’t think it was this bad.

00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:09.020
You should remember me
in your next life, even.

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:10.200
Pandao...

00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:11.490
How many times have I said…

00:11:11.510 --> 00:11:13.230
don’t say nonsense like that.

00:11:13.650 --> 00:11:16.150
So why do you need to stay here?

00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:17.710
Is there a reason?

00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:25.360
I asked to stay here...

00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:27.390
because I’m scared of
the Lord’s scolding.

00:11:27.970 --> 00:11:30.790
And do you think that’s a valid reason?

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:33.230
Valid or not…I don’t care.

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:35.780
But you have to let Worradej stay here.

00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:38.640
But Worradej once betrayed our group.

00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:40.590
He killed one of our own.

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:42.880
If we let him in...

00:11:43.230 --> 00:11:45.750
he could be a threat
to our operation, Kosol.

00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:48.160
But right now Worradej remembers nothing.

00:11:48.890 --> 00:11:51.800
We just have to slowly feed
his memories back.

00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:53.630
And once he becomes someone new...

00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:55.590
then he can help us with our cause.

00:11:57.070 --> 00:11:59.180
But I still don’t trust him.

00:11:59.690 --> 00:12:01.390
When he saw me,

00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:04.030
he accidentally blurted out “A.H.W.”

00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:06.170
Sounds like some kind of secret code.

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:10.130
I’m telling you…he’s definitely
hiding something from us.

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:12.640
Worradej is faking the amnesia.

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:14.370
He’s here to destroy us from within.

00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:22.020
That Worradej is gone.

00:12:22.270 --> 00:12:24.570
And I believe he’d never do that again.

00:12:24.590 --> 00:12:26.640
I won’t lose another comrade

00:12:26.670 --> 00:12:28.540
because of that man ever again.

00:12:29.610 --> 00:12:32.200
So will you let Worradej stay
at your house or not?

00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:34.140
No. I won’t allow it.

00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:36.680
Allow it or not...

00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:40.710
Fine. I’ll allow it. Happy?

00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:44.450
And let me be very clear…

00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:47.050
Worradej is mine.

00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:49.180
Don’t you dare pull the same stunt again.

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:52.840
Or your fate will be
no different from the last.

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:54.640
Are we clear?

00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:59.190
Fine. We’re clear.

00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:03.120
What’s with the “fine”?

00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:04.810
Okay okay! I got it.

00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:06.580
I understand everything now.

00:13:06.610 --> 00:13:08.900
From now on,
I won’t lay a finger on Worradej.

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:20.030
- Is it pretty?
- Nope.

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:22.650
Wow, brutal comment.

00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:25.420
Hey, Pandao.

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:28.460
You and I were probably besties, right?

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:30.530
I probably came to see you every day.

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:32.370
And we’d gossip like gal pals do.

00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:34.600
Yeah, you came here every single day.

00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:36.620
And I kicked you out every single day.

00:13:36.650 --> 00:13:38.770
Maybe I stayed gossiping till late

00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:40.360
so you worried I’d struggle getting home?

00:13:40.390 --> 00:13:42.850
Nope. I was just annoyed by you.

00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:45.240
I hated how you were
always clinging to my brother.

00:13:50.430 --> 00:13:52.550
So I came to see Banjong every day?

00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:56.250
Then what exactly was I to him?

00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:57.750
Worradej...

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:02.550
Banjong said you can stay here.

00:14:02.830 --> 00:14:04.320
Really?

00:14:04.570 --> 00:14:06.680
No way! I won’t allow it!

00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:09.250
Enough, Pandao. It’s alright.

00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:13.410
Worradej, you’re welcome
to stay here as long as you like.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.380
Thanks, Banjong.

00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:16.680
- Ow!
- Ah!

00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:32.860
Sir, you’re really not
letting me stay with you?

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:35.150
Then who’s gonna feed you?

00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:37.970
I’ll prep your bath, lay out your clothes…

00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:40.500
please let me stay and serve you, sir.

00:14:40.530 --> 00:14:41.840
Please, sir.

00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:44.200
Jade.

00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:46.170
I’m not the same person anymore.

00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:49.110
You don’t have to wait
on me hand and foot now.

00:14:49.310 --> 00:14:51.600
Use your time to keep an eye on Father.

00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:54.510
Don’t let him find out I’ve snuck off here.

00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:58.130
I have to investigate...

00:14:58.150 --> 00:14:59.810
how I actually died.

00:14:59.910 --> 00:15:02.190
And once I’ve solved this whole mess,

00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:04.820
I’ll finally be able to go home.

00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:07.780
Then I’ll be waiting, sir.

00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:34.790
(Register of Conscripts,
by Chao Phraya Singhanakhon)

00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:40.360
It’s exactly the same.

00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:42.250
Like, spot-on.

00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:45.590
Banjong totally wrote
this love letter for that Worradej.

00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:46.930
Oh my god.

00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:49.390
Girl, does this mean
you’ve got two boyfriends?

00:15:49.410 --> 00:15:50.600
Oh my god.

00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:54.070
Worradej.

00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:55.890
Where are you?

00:15:57.100 --> 00:15:58.510
Worradej?

00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:03.630
Worradej!

00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:06.000
What are you doing in Banjong’s office?

00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:08.030
You’re living here now…

00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:10.470
you can’t just wander around aimlessly.

00:16:12.210 --> 00:16:14.210
I was just lost, alright?

00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:16.800
It’s literally my first day here.

00:16:16.830 --> 00:16:19.020
I'm so confused already.

00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:21.190
This isn’t your first day here.

00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:23.160
You’ve been here a hundred times.

00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:24.880
Oh please...

00:16:24.910 --> 00:16:27.210
Don’t scold me, darling.

00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:30.550
Anyway, what brings you to me?
Business or...?

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:32.550
Or did you miss me?

00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:35.150
I saw you moved in here,

00:16:35.390 --> 00:16:37.190
but didn’t bring any of your stuff.

00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:38.940
So I thought I’d take you to the market.

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:40.620
Get you some new things.

00:16:41.130 --> 00:16:42.850
Really? Let’s go, let’s go!

00:16:42.890 --> 00:16:44.230
I love shopping!

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:45.430
Love what?

00:16:45.750 --> 00:16:47.240
Shopping.

00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:49.890
Come on!

00:16:50.070 --> 00:16:51.470
Hurry!

00:16:51.730 --> 00:16:52.920
Right this way!

00:16:52.940 --> 00:16:54.680
- Take a look!
- Go ahead!

00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:56.810
- Come, come!
- Want some limes?

00:16:56.830 --> 00:16:58.710
Buy one, get one free!

00:16:58.730 --> 00:17:01.090
Silk trousers! Trousers here!

00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:02.250
Great fabric, too!

00:17:04.339 --> 00:17:06.780
Bracelets, darling! Pretty bangles!

00:17:14.569 --> 00:17:16.140
I looked around for you.

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:18.079
No such thing as "shopping" like you said.

00:17:18.109 --> 00:17:20.550
Just grilled chicken. Want some?

00:17:21.890 --> 00:17:23.230
It’s fine.

00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:26.530
Hey, Kosol…

00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:28.260
don’t you feel something... off?

00:17:28.650 --> 00:17:30.120
I feel like…

00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:32.500
people at the market
are giving us weird looks.

00:17:32.530 --> 00:17:34.320
You want one, dear? Hurry!

00:17:34.350 --> 00:17:36.250
Of course they are. They know about us.

00:17:36.670 --> 00:17:38.450
The Count, son of the governor,

00:17:38.470 --> 00:17:40.550
fooling around with a filthy ex-con.

00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:43.820
Nothing makes better gossip
than the two of us.

00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:52.150
What are you doing?

00:17:52.180 --> 00:17:54.290
If they’re gonna talk anyway,

00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:57.270
I might as well give them
something juicier to talk about.

00:17:57.710 --> 00:17:59.270
Let it be scandalous.

00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:01.690
Wait.

00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:04.980
Let me ask you something.

00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:06.990
What’s your name?

00:18:07.010 --> 00:18:08.430
Huh?

00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:10.780
My name’s Worradej. Obviously.

00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:12.180
What’s wrong with you?

00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:14.600
Sudden memory loss or something?

00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:16.180
Forgetting my name, seriously?

00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:18.460
I’m just not used to it.

00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:20.760
You never used to be this cheeky before.

00:18:21.790 --> 00:18:23.960
It’s like ever since you drank that poison,

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.580
another spirit’s taken over your body.

00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:30.190
Wow, your imagination…

00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:31.910
it’s kinda next level.

00:18:31.930 --> 00:18:33.980
I’m still the same old Worradej.

00:18:34.010 --> 00:18:36.330
Just with extra sass now.

00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:38.580
You like it?

00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:44.590
Hey! Don’t walk away…answer me first.

00:18:44.610 --> 00:18:46.000
Do you like it or not?

00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:49.740
Kosol.

00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:52.490
If you like it, just say so.

00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:58.480
I don’t get why you’d let
Worradej stay with us again.

00:18:58.660 --> 00:19:01.080
Aren’t you afraid he’ll stir up
trouble in our group?

00:19:02.250 --> 00:19:04.250
Or are you scared of Lord Kosol?

00:19:04.270 --> 00:19:06.070
Did he threaten you?

00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:09.110
Me? Afraid of Kosol?

00:19:09.210 --> 00:19:10.360
Not a chance.

00:19:11.490 --> 00:19:13.150
If he tries anything,

00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:14.590
I can fight back just fine.

00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:16.750
But the reason I gave in…

00:19:17.020 --> 00:19:19.640
Because I want Worradej
where we can see him.

00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:21.880
If he plans anything shady again,

00:19:22.090 --> 00:19:23.610
we’ll shut him down fast.

00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:24.910
Is that so?

00:19:24.940 --> 00:19:26.210
Exactly.

00:19:29.670 --> 00:19:31.090
Could you go easy?

00:19:31.370 --> 00:19:33.370
So what happened to your arm?

00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:35.790
Did Lord Kosol twist it or something?

00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:38.410
No.

00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:40.690
If he had done that to me,

00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:42.630
I’d have punched him right back by now.

00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:45.210
It’s just...

00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:47.760
I stretched wrong when I was yawning.

00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:50.740
Keep massaging, please.

00:20:03.380 --> 00:20:05.150
So damn good.

00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:07.990
Auntie, how much for
these khanom krok?

00:20:08.010 --> 00:20:09.760
Eight pairs for half a pai.

00:20:10.090 --> 00:20:12.240
Then I’ll take half a pai, please.

00:20:13.460 --> 00:20:14.600
Not selling.

00:20:15.930 --> 00:20:18.830
Alright, just one pai it is.

00:20:19.890 --> 00:20:21.890
No matter how many pai, I’m not selling.

00:20:21.910 --> 00:20:24.640
I won’t sell to perverts.
I don’t wanna end up in jail too.

00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:27.340
Are you gonna sell or not?

00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:29.820
No.

00:20:29.950 --> 00:20:32.370
Then I guess I’ll just smash
all your stuff to bits.

00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:34.360
Oh…okay!

00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:36.330
I’ll sell! I’ll sell!

00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:38.240
Let me grab it for you right now.

00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:45.530
Listen up, all vendors.

00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:48.610
If I visit your shop…

00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:51.600
and you refuse to sell to me,

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.180
then get ready to carry the rubble home.

00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:56.420
So scary.

00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:00.300
Kosol...

00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:02.680
This kind of behavior won’t help us.

00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:05.430
It’s only going to make
the villagers hate us even more.

00:21:06.050 --> 00:21:08.120
I never asked anyone to love me.

00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:12.750
Why are you like this?

00:21:15.050 --> 00:21:16.310
Now watch me.

00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:22.070
Dear vendors, every single one of you…

00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:24.020
whatever you brought today...

00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:26.400
I’ll buy it all.

00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:30.770
Here’s the money.

00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:32.610
I, Count Worradej,

00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:36.330
have enough to pay for every single shop.

00:21:36.390 --> 00:21:38.460
And to all the lovely people
shopping here today…

00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:40.860
keep your money in your pockets.

00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:42.710
I’ll cover everything for you.

00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:46.300
I’m footing the bill today.

00:21:56.980 --> 00:21:58.850
- Careful, it’s hot!
- Thanks, love!

00:21:58.870 --> 00:22:00.870
Auntie, those khanom krok…

00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:02.960
keep making them till you run out, okay?

00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:05.400
Just tell me how much when you're done.

00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:07.430
Alright, everyone!

00:22:07.450 --> 00:22:10.380
If you want khanom krok,
come get them!

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:11.960
Hurry up!

00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:13.760
They’ll be gone before you know it!

00:22:16.430 --> 00:22:18.960
See? Winning people over…

00:22:18.990 --> 00:22:20.500
is actually super easy.

00:22:20.530 --> 00:22:21.750
From now on,

00:22:21.770 --> 00:22:23.670
everyone’s gonna talk about this moment.

00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:25.850
It’ll spread through the whole village.

00:22:25.870 --> 00:22:28.000
And our reputation…

00:22:28.030 --> 00:22:30.750
will turn from bad to fabulous.

00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:32.620
Genius, right?

00:22:32.750 --> 00:22:35.100
Where did you even get the money

00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:37.390
to buy out the entire market?

00:22:38.170 --> 00:22:39.490
It’s my own money!

00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:41.380
Been saving it for years…never used it.

00:22:41.870 --> 00:22:43.500
Wow, Jade!

00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:46.270
Am I seriously rich enough
to have a chest of coins?

00:22:46.290 --> 00:22:48.430
The Lord gave it for you to spend, sir.

00:22:48.460 --> 00:22:51.180
But you never touched it…
not for all these years.

00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:52.890
And why didn’t I use it?

00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:55.000
Was I... stingy or something?

00:22:55.410 --> 00:22:57.610
Or was I saving it for something?

00:22:57.640 --> 00:22:59.110
You weren’t stingy, sir.

00:22:59.140 --> 00:23:01.140
And you weren’t saving up
for anything either.

00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:03.800
That money came from the Lord...

00:23:03.830 --> 00:23:06.070
squeezed out of the villagers.

00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:08.690
You said you couldn’t
bring yourself to use it.

00:23:09.070 --> 00:23:11.370
But I found a way to put it back into use…

00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:13.580
to help the people he took it from.

00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:16.290
You should try being nice to them for once.

00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:18.890
With that scowl,
no one wants to come near you.

00:23:19.370 --> 00:23:20.700
Except you, apparently.

00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:27.990
The snacks are for eating…
my hand is not.

00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:36.750
What?

00:23:38.850 --> 00:23:40.080
No, you can’t.

00:23:43.570 --> 00:23:44.860
Worradej, you bastard!

00:23:45.790 --> 00:23:47.210
Worradej!

00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:49.780
Open up, Worradej!

00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:04.340
Hey! Why the hell are you locking doors?

00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:06.190
I told you not to do that!

00:24:06.220 --> 00:24:08.780
This is my house…
no one gets private space here!

00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:09.950
Hey!

00:24:10.110 --> 00:24:12.460
You hear me? Come unlock this door!

00:24:12.490 --> 00:24:14.960
Don’t leave me out here
yelling like a lunatic!

00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:17.690
Open up, damn it!

00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:19.520
Who’s in there?

00:24:19.540 --> 00:24:22.120
If you don’t open up,
I’ll have someone bust that door down!

00:24:22.810 --> 00:24:24.690
It’s me, Jade, sir.

00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:25.970
Jade, you brat.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.710
You think you can mess with me?

00:24:27.730 --> 00:24:29.360
You heard me,
so why didn’t you open up?

00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:31.260
I’ve got business with Worradej.

00:24:31.550 --> 00:24:33.790
Uh… he’s asleep, sir.

00:24:33.820 --> 00:24:35.700
Then wake him up, dammit!

00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:38.250
If you don’t dare wake him,
unlock the door!

00:24:38.270 --> 00:24:40.200
I’ll drag him outta bed myself!

00:24:40.230 --> 00:24:42.620
Please don’t come in yet, sir.

00:24:42.650 --> 00:24:45.170
Uh… he’s sleeping naked.

00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:46.750
Not really something you wanna see.

00:24:46.780 --> 00:24:50.260
I’ve seen him naked since the day
he popped outta his mama.

00:24:50.290 --> 00:24:52.110
What’s the big deal seeing it again?

00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:54.690
Open up! Even you got to see it!

00:24:55.750 --> 00:24:57.630
Papa dear…

00:24:57.650 --> 00:25:01.060
I’m still feeling woozy from when
you hit me with that cane the other day.

00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:04.860
My head’s still spinning, seriously.

00:25:05.110 --> 00:25:09.500
Can you maybe come yell
at me some other time, please?

00:25:10.250 --> 00:25:11.420
What’s up with your voice?

00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:15.910
Um… I got whacked in
the throat with the cane, too.

00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:18.600
Quit acting pitiful.

00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:21.550
You’ve taken plenty of my whacks and lived.

00:25:21.580 --> 00:25:23.580
Now get out here and let me see you!

00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:26.180
Maybe one or two more
whacks and you’ll be cured.

00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:34.710
What’s wrong with you?

00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:36.590
I’m gonna throw up, sir.

00:25:38.890 --> 00:25:41.660
Agh! Jade, go get a cloth…quick!

00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:44.780
Yes, sir! Hold it in, please!
Don’t let it out yet!

00:25:47.950 --> 00:25:49.730
You just puked all over my head!

00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:51.500
Ugh, master!

00:25:51.540 --> 00:25:53.220
What did you even eat, sir?

00:25:53.250 --> 00:25:54.400
That stinks, for real.

00:25:58.140 --> 00:25:59.530
Yeah, yeah.

00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:01.560
You just rest and get better first.

00:26:01.580 --> 00:26:03.830
Then I’ll deal with you properly.

00:26:24.340 --> 00:26:25.820
Hey, Kosol.

00:26:25.850 --> 00:26:27.510
Make sure you eat plenty this meal, alright?

00:26:27.530 --> 00:26:29.130
Count Worradej is footing the bill.

00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:33.860
You sneaked out like this…

00:26:33.990 --> 00:26:35.730
aren’t you scared your dad will freak out?

00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:39.310
If he wants to freak out, let him.
I’m not there anymore.

00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:42.550
Not my business.
I don’t care what happens.

00:26:42.580 --> 00:26:43.800
Why should I be scared?

00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:45.630
You haven’t forgotten, right?

00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:48.290
That your father’s our enemy?

00:26:48.730 --> 00:26:50.100
You’re the son of our rival.

00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:52.680
And then...

00:26:52.820 --> 00:26:55.480
this “group of ours”
you keep talking about…

00:26:55.570 --> 00:26:56.980
So what is this group of yours?

00:26:57.010 --> 00:27:00.050
It was the Viwat People group,
personally founded by Banjong.

00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:02.850
There’s me, you, Pandao…

00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:04.600
and a bunch of others too.

00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:06.550
We all share the same goal:

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.730
to take Chaiyached off the throne.

00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:13.040
Are you saying...

00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:18.380
we’re staging a rebellion?

00:27:18.930 --> 00:27:20.000
Yeah.

00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:22.850
That’s intense.

00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:25.250
So then...

00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:27.020
who’s gonna take the throne?

00:27:27.150 --> 00:27:28.270
No one.

00:27:28.300 --> 00:27:30.100
We’re changing the system.

00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:32.230
Even more intense.

00:27:32.250 --> 00:27:34.800
So what kind of system
are we switching to?

00:27:34.820 --> 00:27:36.130
My lord...

00:27:37.930 --> 00:27:39.660
Thank you so much, sir.

00:27:39.690 --> 00:27:41.690
If I hadn’t gotten this rice today,

00:27:41.710 --> 00:27:44.480
me and my kid would’ve gone
another day without food.

00:27:45.290 --> 00:27:46.750
It’s alright.

00:27:46.780 --> 00:27:49.130
But I can’t come hand out
food like this every day.

00:27:49.230 --> 00:27:50.650
Where’s the kid’s father?

00:27:50.670 --> 00:27:52.350
Didn’t he help raise your child?

00:27:53.270 --> 00:27:55.590
He got drafted to war last year.

00:27:55.620 --> 00:27:57.840
Word is, he died on the battlefield.

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.400
But let’s not dwell on sad stories.

00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:02.490
Don’t wanna bring down your mood, my lord.

00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:03.700
I’ll be off then.

00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:05.600
Sweetheart, bow to the nobleman.

00:28:08.740 --> 00:28:09.910
Wait a sec.

00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:16.980
Thank you, sir.

00:28:25.490 --> 00:28:27.240
Hey, Kosol…

00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:30.140
If her husband died at war like that,

00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:33.380
shouldn’t she get
some sort of compensation?

00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:35.540
Peasants are their master’s property.

00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:38.130
It’s like breaking a drinking glass…

00:28:38.290 --> 00:28:40.270
you just sweep it up and move on.

00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:44.740
So then...

00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:47.590
those people we saw at the market…

00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:49.450
are they all peasants too?

00:28:49.540 --> 00:28:51.200
Who do they even belong to?

00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:53.870
Each one’s got a different owner.

00:28:54.030 --> 00:28:57.680
Today they can earn
a few coins to feed their families,

00:28:57.700 --> 00:28:58.940
but next month…

00:28:58.980 --> 00:29:01.550
they might get conscripted
to work at some noble’s home,

00:29:01.570 --> 00:29:03.190
with no pay at all.

00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:04.710
They’d even have to pack their own rice.

00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:07.020
And stop their own work for a whole month.

00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:09.760
How are they ever
supposed to build a life like that?

00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:12.550
If things stay the way they are…

00:29:12.580 --> 00:29:13.910
they’ll never stand a chance.

00:29:16.780 --> 00:29:18.110
That’s why, isn’t it?

00:29:18.410 --> 00:29:20.480
That we’re trying to change everything.

00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:35.380
Is it urgent business?

00:29:35.890 --> 00:29:38.040
To come disturb my rest like this?

00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:40.450
It’s very urgent, Your Majesty.

00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:42.980
If Your Majesty doesn’t act fast,

00:29:43.220 --> 00:29:45.430
you’ll be in danger yourself.

00:29:45.570 --> 00:29:47.800
I discovered a plot to overthrow the throne

00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:49.530
drawn up by Lord Kosol, Your Majesty.

00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:00.930
(Sorn – Damrong: mastermind)

00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:02.680
(Kosol)

00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:04.530
(Jiam – Kaew – Jerd:
fake news network)

00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:07.350
What is this?

00:30:07.380 --> 00:30:08.570
I don’t understand it at all.

00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:10.390
Didn’t you just make this up?

00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:17.470
I had someone sneak into
Lord Kosol’s house.

00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:19.380
That’s where I found this diagram.

00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:22.010
And it fits the situation.

00:30:22.030 --> 00:30:25.390
You were attacked near
that very house, after all.

00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:31.750
Your Majesty must take action against
Lord Kosol at once.

00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:34.990
Thank you, Count, for your concern.

00:30:35.090 --> 00:30:37.820
I shall summon Lord Kosol
for questioning at a later time.

00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:40.970
If that’s all, you may leave now.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:45.790
If Your Majesty won’t act…

00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:49.370
then I may have to inform
Somdet Saenyakorn as required.

00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:51.530
And by then…

00:30:51.860 --> 00:30:55.130
he’ll bring troops from
the capital to Singhanakhon.

00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:58.210
He’ll personally deal
with Lord Kosol himself.

00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:01.340
That Somdet Saenyakorn...

00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:04.800
he’s the one who proposed the law
punishing same-sex love with jail time.

00:31:04.830 --> 00:31:06.170
Hmm.

00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:07.730
So it’s Saenyakorn.

00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:10.780
He’s the root of it all.
The one who made queers suffer for centuries.

00:31:10.980 --> 00:31:13.250
If we can stop him now…

00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:16.480
then those who come after us

00:31:16.510 --> 00:31:18.620
won’t have to endure
these cruel laws anymore.

00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:20.950
At first, hearing you wanted
to start a rebellion…

00:31:20.970 --> 00:31:22.970
it sounded terrifying.

00:31:23.060 --> 00:31:26.060
But now that I know why,
it’s actually for the people’s good.

00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:29.840
You’re full, aren’t you?

00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:31.280
Let’s go.

00:31:32.130 --> 00:31:33.500
Kosol…

00:31:33.750 --> 00:31:36.340
can I take some khanom krok with me?

00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:37.940
I really like them.

00:31:40.620 --> 00:31:42.410
Wait up, Kosol…

00:31:43.980 --> 00:31:45.800
Carry this for me.

00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:47.850
My hands are full.

00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:56.660
Hold on…what’s this…

00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:58.890
Someone must’ve ratted us out…

00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:02.100
saying the two of us were
walking arm in arm at the market.

00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:04.990
Come on, what’s the big deal…

00:32:05.020 --> 00:32:07.230
two guys linking arms, seriously?

00:32:07.250 --> 00:32:09.030
Ugh, do they have to go this far?

00:32:09.060 --> 00:32:10.700
All tough with commoners…

00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:12.290
but tell me this for real…

00:32:12.310 --> 00:32:14.570
have they ever won a single war?

00:32:18.590 --> 00:32:21.280
Royal decree from King Chaiyached…

00:32:21.310 --> 00:32:24.420
on suspicion that Lord Kosol

00:32:24.450 --> 00:32:27.320
is behind the attempted regicide.

00:32:27.350 --> 00:32:29.450
Therefore, it is commanded…

00:32:29.470 --> 00:32:31.910
that Lord Kosol undergo the firewalk ritual…

00:32:32.110 --> 00:32:34.200
to prove his innocence.

00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:36.340
Receive the royal decree!

00:32:36.410 --> 00:32:38.200
Oh please, brother…

00:32:38.230 --> 00:32:40.480
forcing a living man to walk through fire?

00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:42.690
He’s either gonna burn or… burn.

00:32:42.710 --> 00:32:45.630
And when exactly does innocence get proven?

00:32:46.190 --> 00:32:48.100
Ugh, Kosol…what are you even thinking?

00:32:48.130 --> 00:32:49.310
Are you out of your mind?

00:32:49.420 --> 00:32:50.910
Let them think what they want.

00:33:34.110 --> 00:33:35.950
Tell your master this for me…

00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:38.700
if he wants to capture me…

00:33:38.730 --> 00:33:41.190
he better send soldiers
who can actually fight.

00:33:41.420 --> 00:33:43.270
I’ll be waiting.

00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:50.600
That look…

00:33:50.620 --> 00:33:52.790
we're in trouble for sure.

00:33:55.240 --> 00:33:56.980
Let me go…ouch!

00:33:57.010 --> 00:33:59.250
Where are you dragging me?

00:33:59.270 --> 00:34:01.320
Kosol, I said let go!

00:34:02.970 --> 00:34:04.190
Hey!

00:34:04.210 --> 00:34:06.000
Why so rough?

00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:08.330
Did you call the soldiers on me?

00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:10.940
I didn’t do anything!

00:34:10.969 --> 00:34:12.280
Why would I?

00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:14.480
Besides, the soldiers said it themselves

00:34:14.510 --> 00:34:16.770
it was King Chaiyached’s order.

00:34:16.929 --> 00:34:18.929
You accused me just the other day

00:34:18.949 --> 00:34:21.190
of killing my own little brother.

00:34:21.210 --> 00:34:24.179
So today you might be teaming up
with them to get rid of me.

00:34:25.650 --> 00:34:29.429
I swear…may my face break out forever…

00:34:29.449 --> 00:34:30.960
I didn’t do it!

00:34:30.980 --> 00:34:32.199
And you…

00:34:32.230 --> 00:34:34.600
are you really sure
you didn’t kill Chaiyached?

00:34:36.370 --> 00:34:37.810
Listen carefully.

00:34:38.179 --> 00:34:40.510
Yes, I plan to overthrow him…

00:34:40.540 --> 00:34:42.380
but I don’t need to kill him.

00:34:42.739 --> 00:34:44.320
Why waste the effort…

00:34:44.340 --> 00:34:45.980
on one pathetic boy?

00:34:46.190 --> 00:34:49.159
I just need to chain him up
and throw him in a dung pit.

00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:50.900
But you're the one planning a rebellion.

00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:53.040
If you didn’t assassinate him…
then who did?

00:34:53.060 --> 00:34:54.130
Who else?

00:34:54.159 --> 00:34:56.790
I'm not the only one with
plans to overthrow the throne.

00:34:56.820 --> 00:34:59.700
That bastard Warlord Saenyakorn’s
been eyeing power too.

00:34:59.810 --> 00:35:02.350
And the one serving him loyally…

00:35:02.460 --> 00:35:03.880
you know who it is.

00:35:04.590 --> 00:35:05.910
It’s your father.

00:35:07.850 --> 00:35:09.440
My Lord Father?

00:35:10.010 --> 00:35:11.640
Don’t play dumb with me.

00:35:11.660 --> 00:35:14.150
You’re his son. You know the truth.

00:35:14.630 --> 00:35:16.290
While I’m on the run…

00:35:16.310 --> 00:35:18.690
you’re staying here as my hostage.

00:35:19.730 --> 00:35:21.020
Come here.

00:35:21.050 --> 00:35:23.000
You're the worst!

00:35:23.030 --> 00:35:25.080
I’m nobody’s captive lover, you know!

00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:27.390
Ow! I’ll file a report…

00:35:27.410 --> 00:35:29.030
you're unlawfully detaining me!

00:35:29.050 --> 00:35:30.110
Help!

00:35:35.690 --> 00:35:37.870
Flowers within reach…

00:35:39.470 --> 00:35:41.790
how tempting to hold them close.

00:35:44.130 --> 00:35:46.330
But still I hesitate…

00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:50.770
are you pure or poison?

00:36:04.150 --> 00:36:06.250
Brother Banjong!
It’s bad, Brother Banjong!

00:36:06.270 --> 00:36:08.080
What’s all the commotion, Pandao?

00:36:08.110 --> 00:36:10.200
I'm working here…you scared me!

00:36:10.280 --> 00:36:12.370
Brother Kosol got surrounded by
soldiers at the market.

00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:14.170
They accused him of attempted regicide.

00:36:14.630 --> 00:36:15.630
What?

00:36:15.790 --> 00:36:17.480
What’s happening now?

00:36:17.510 --> 00:36:18.730
Did they catch him?

00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:21.400
Not yet. They say he escaped
into the forest with Worradej.

00:36:21.430 --> 00:36:24.290
Brother Banjong, I’m sure it was Worradej

00:36:24.310 --> 00:36:25.880
he’s the one who called the soldiers.

00:36:25.910 --> 00:36:28.320
I told you we shouldn’t trust him.

00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:40.440
(A flower within reach, tempting to hold close,
but still I wonder, is it sweet or sinister?)

00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:52.540
Are we really doing this?

00:36:52.660 --> 00:36:55.360
Are we seriously gonna live
in the forest like this?

00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:57.440
What are we even gonna eat?

00:36:57.580 --> 00:36:59.620
There's no toilet or anything.

00:37:00.040 --> 00:37:01.570
And wild beasts, too.

00:37:05.380 --> 00:37:06.690
But I forgot…

00:37:06.730 --> 00:37:09.610
you’re more savage than any beast.

00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:13.580
How many days are we stuck out here?

00:37:14.530 --> 00:37:17.180
Don’t even know where we’ll bathe.

00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:20.560
Why does my life have to be this miserable?

00:37:20.590 --> 00:37:22.870
I just want to go home.

00:37:23.220 --> 00:37:25.630
Ugh, and now I’m stuck…

00:37:25.660 --> 00:37:26.960
why...

00:37:29.630 --> 00:37:32.010
Fine, I’m done talking.

00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:35.960
Go cut some banana leaves.

00:37:36.210 --> 00:37:37.770
I’ll use them to build a shelter.

00:37:48.690 --> 00:37:49.750
Seriously?

00:37:49.830 --> 00:37:53.080
From an influencer
with over 3 million followers…

00:37:53.110 --> 00:37:57.010
Now I’m a forest girl
chopping banana leaves for a hut?

00:37:57.040 --> 00:37:58.410
Ugh.

00:37:58.440 --> 00:38:00.600
If I had my phone right now…

00:38:00.620 --> 00:38:04.070
I’d be posting the juiciest TokTok content.

00:38:06.250 --> 00:38:08.170
So? Where are the banana leaves?

00:38:09.190 --> 00:38:11.940
If I can’t find any…

00:38:11.970 --> 00:38:14.240
do I have to grow
a banana tree from scratch,

00:38:14.260 --> 00:38:16.100
wait for it to sprout, then harvest it?

00:38:16.150 --> 00:38:17.440
If I come back empty-handed,

00:38:17.460 --> 00:38:20.570
I’ll get murdered and dumped
in the woods for sure. Ugh!

00:38:26.900 --> 00:38:28.980
What the heck is that?

00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:31.210
A deer? An elk?

00:38:31.230 --> 00:38:33.600
A lion? Or a tapir?

00:38:36.180 --> 00:38:37.960
Don’t you come any closer!

00:38:37.980 --> 00:38:39.590
I’ll fight, I swear!

00:38:48.020 --> 00:38:51.630
Aww, it’s a lil bunny.

00:38:53.380 --> 00:38:55.930
You’re so adorable.

00:38:56.010 --> 00:38:57.850
What’s your name, sweetie?

00:38:57.870 --> 00:39:00.380
Are you lost too?

00:39:00.410 --> 00:39:03.030
Kosol, look…isn’t
this cutie just the sweetest?

00:39:03.050 --> 00:39:05.230
Can I keep the bunny?

00:39:24.110 --> 00:39:26.970
You killed the bunny right in front of me.

00:39:27.220 --> 00:39:29.290
I’m not eating it. No way I could.

00:39:30.470 --> 00:39:32.470
Didn’t I teach you already?

00:39:33.010 --> 00:39:35.010
That the weak

00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:36.580
are prey to the strong.

00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:38.920
But we should still show mercy.

00:39:38.940 --> 00:39:40.220
If you’re stronger,

00:39:40.250 --> 00:39:43.300
you should be protecting the weak,
not hurting them.

00:39:43.330 --> 00:39:45.600
You’re way bigger than that bunny.

00:39:45.620 --> 00:39:46.740
This…

00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:49.180
this is bullying the helpless.

00:39:49.790 --> 00:39:51.610
So are you eating or not?

00:39:52.210 --> 00:39:53.550
I’m not.

00:39:55.570 --> 00:39:56.570
Eat.

00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:33.270
So…

00:40:33.300 --> 00:40:34.790
what about the right thigh?

00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:38.080
Here, take it.

00:40:39.140 --> 00:40:41.260
Tear it for me.

00:40:43.330 --> 00:40:45.190
You’re such a high-maintenance brat.

00:41:00.830 --> 00:41:02.830
What are we doing here, Kosol?

00:41:03.320 --> 00:41:05.940
Stripped down like
this…obviously, we’re bathing.

00:41:06.070 --> 00:41:07.660
Can I skip it?

00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:09.490
I’m cold.

00:41:09.610 --> 00:41:11.030
You go ahead and bathe alone.

00:41:11.910 --> 00:41:13.040
No.

00:41:13.060 --> 00:41:14.510
You have to bathe too.

00:41:14.540 --> 00:41:16.660
Because you’re sleeping next to me tonight.

00:41:16.690 --> 00:41:18.520
And I don’t want to smell your stink.

00:41:18.620 --> 00:41:19.790
What are you doing?

00:41:19.820 --> 00:41:21.470
Are you trying to assault me?

00:41:21.500 --> 00:41:23.000
Let go! Let go!

00:41:23.020 --> 00:41:24.390
Hurry and undress.

00:41:24.410 --> 00:41:27.120
Let go! I said stop! Stop!

00:41:30.530 --> 00:41:32.730
You’re a savage, a power freak.

00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:34.150
Always forcing yourself on people.

00:41:34.180 --> 00:41:35.980
This is pure toxic masculinity.

00:41:36.010 --> 00:41:38.070
Think you’re king of
the world or something?

00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:43.880
What are you so shocked about?

00:41:44.120 --> 00:41:45.990
Acting like it’s your first time seeing one.

00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:51.450
Don’t think I’ll swoon just
‘cause it looks good.

00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:54.010
I’m still not bathing
with you no matter what.

00:41:54.040 --> 00:41:57.160
I don’t know what
I let you get away with before,

00:41:57.190 --> 00:41:59.900
but from now on,
I won’t let it happen again.

00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:03.650
Worradej is not your victim anymore.

00:42:08.030 --> 00:42:09.840
Are you trying to turn me on?

00:42:10.210 --> 00:42:11.940
You say one thing,
but your eyes say another.

00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:14.010
I’m not.

00:42:14.460 --> 00:42:15.600
It’s slippery.

00:42:24.750 --> 00:42:26.190
Help!

00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:29.190
It’s shallow. You won’t drown.

00:42:36.470 --> 00:42:38.470
And in this water...

00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:42.340
Are there snakes or crocs?

00:42:42.750 --> 00:42:44.210
I’m scared.

00:42:45.690 --> 00:42:47.690
Didn’t you say it yourself?

00:42:47.810 --> 00:42:49.150
That in this whole forest,

00:42:49.410 --> 00:42:50.860
I’m the fiercest beast?

00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:53.190
Don’t panic.

00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:56.020
With me, you’ve got nothing to fear.

00:43:02.290 --> 00:43:03.480
Worradej...

00:43:05.550 --> 00:43:07.330
When you’re soaking wet,

00:43:08.720 --> 00:43:11.040
you’re dangerously attractive to me.

00:43:30.770 --> 00:43:34.130
You’re dangerously attractive to me too.

00:43:40.840 --> 00:43:42.190
It feels like...

00:43:42.220 --> 00:43:44.390
something brushed against my leg.

00:43:46.690 --> 00:43:48.570
It’s my snakehead fish.

00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:55.000
Something else just swam into my leg too.

00:43:56.760 --> 00:43:58.860
That’s my striped snakehead.

00:44:00.930 --> 00:44:02.230
Kosol...

00:44:03.550 --> 00:44:05.220
Can I...

00:44:05.330 --> 00:44:08.330
touch the little one for a bit?

00:44:09.090 --> 00:44:10.240
Go ahead.

00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:12.470
Just don’t let it bite.

00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:42.970
Tell me right now…

00:44:42.990 --> 00:44:45.110
about my relationship…

00:44:45.130 --> 00:44:47.250
What exactly is going on
between you and Banjong?

00:44:47.510 --> 00:44:48.720
And where’s Kosol now?

00:44:48.750 --> 00:44:51.920
Last seen hiding
in the western forest, sir.

00:44:51.940 --> 00:44:54.010
This time I’ve finally
caught up with you, brother.

00:44:54.030 --> 00:44:55.650
Turn yourself in peacefully.

00:44:55.880 --> 00:44:58.260
Worradej, where are you hiding Kosol?

00:44:58.280 --> 00:45:00.690
What do you mean?
I don’t know anything!

00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:04.020
Jade’s just a servant…
he wouldn’t dare harm Lord Kosol.

00:45:04.350 --> 00:45:06.900
I bet Kosol’s already been captured.

00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:11.580
(Shooting a water scene in winter)

00:45:11.930 --> 00:45:13.790
(So cold…need a hug)

00:45:13.960 --> 00:45:14.960
(But once filming’s done)

00:45:15.130 --> 00:45:17.380
Wanna hop in and play too?
(Suddenly happy)

00:45:19.230 --> 00:45:21.070
Whoa (Blushing, maybe?)

00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:22.880
Hold on, I hiccupped…just a sec
(Someone get Kosol a glass of water)

00:45:23.090 --> 00:45:24.440
I just learned that

00:45:24.460 --> 00:45:26.380
this kind of coin
was used back in the day.

00:45:26.410 --> 00:45:27.720
Is this shell money?

00:45:27.750 --> 00:45:29.610
- Gonna give in or not?
- Go full force!

00:45:29.630 --> 00:45:31.010
Shove me hard! (Give it your all!)

00:45:32.840 --> 00:45:34.280
(That must’ve hurt)

00:45:34.310 --> 00:45:35.760
Help!

00:45:35.790 --> 00:45:37.400
Somebody help me! Anyone here?
(Easy there with the Count!)

00:45:37.430 --> 00:45:38.470
(Passed the take!)

00:45:38.490 --> 00:45:39.750
(Let me vent a little)

00:45:39.770 --> 00:45:41.400
He just won’t walk!
