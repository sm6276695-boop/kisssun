00:00:11.636 --> 00:00:12.595
You…

00:00:15.724 --> 00:00:17.976
can live without him just fine.

00:00:23.523 --> 00:00:25.191
But I have nobody,

00:00:26.192 --> 00:00:27.235
so please…

00:00:28.611 --> 00:00:30.280
please don't see him.

00:00:33.324 --> 00:00:35.452
What's wrong with you?

00:00:35.535 --> 00:00:38.204
Promise me that you won't see him.

00:00:43.543 --> 00:00:44.878
You're being strange.

00:00:45.962 --> 00:00:48.048
You're acting really strange.

00:00:48.673 --> 00:00:49.549
This isn't normal--

00:00:49.632 --> 00:00:52.427
I had feelings for him first.

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:57.724
If it hadn't been you,

00:00:57.807 --> 00:01:01.186
I wouldn't have cared
if he had a girlfriend or not.

00:01:03.188 --> 00:01:05.148
But I stayed away because of you.

00:01:07.692 --> 00:01:09.778
Because you were more important to me.

00:01:14.783 --> 00:01:16.076
It's been ten years.

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.997
If you loved him so much,
you should have told him by now.

00:01:22.332 --> 00:01:25.502
After all this time,
how was it because of me?

00:01:28.922 --> 00:01:30.048
You don't know how…

00:01:30.965 --> 00:01:33.676
you don't know
how hard I fought to keep going.

00:01:36.471 --> 00:01:38.389
You brought him back into my life,

00:01:38.473 --> 00:01:41.392
so why are you getting in the way now?

00:01:42.644 --> 00:01:44.646
You're the one who got in the way.

00:01:46.856 --> 00:01:48.650
Back then and even now,

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:51.069
it was always you.

00:01:53.488 --> 00:01:56.282
You were the one who first suggested

00:01:57.408 --> 00:01:58.284
we work with him.

00:01:58.368 --> 00:01:59.202
So?

00:02:03.665 --> 00:02:05.458
Are you going to date him again?

00:02:06.334 --> 00:02:07.710
Do I owe you an answer?

00:02:11.422 --> 00:02:12.757
Eun-jung.

00:02:13.258 --> 00:02:14.843
Eun-jung, you're a nice person.

00:02:14.926 --> 00:02:16.719
I'm not nice at all.

00:02:18.555 --> 00:02:19.639
Is that

00:02:21.266 --> 00:02:22.851
your idea of being nice?

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:25.603
What do you want from me?

00:02:25.687 --> 00:02:27.021
Call it what you like.

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:29.774
I don't care if it's out of pity.

00:02:29.858 --> 00:02:31.943
Just please don't date him.

00:02:32.026 --> 00:02:34.028
Why would I pity you?

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:39.617
What you're doing now isn't love.

00:02:42.078 --> 00:02:43.329
It's a twisted obsession.

00:02:43.955 --> 00:02:46.457
You're right. I'm twisted and sick.

00:02:46.541 --> 00:02:50.044
You're right about everything,
so please don't see him.

00:02:50.128 --> 00:02:51.504
I beg you.

00:03:05.518 --> 00:03:08.062
Get it together, Cheon Sang-yeon.

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:13.818
Whatever we decide to do…

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:17.488
It's between him and me.

00:04:20.802 --> 00:04:24.722
YOU AND EVERYTHING ELSE

00:05:22.196 --> 00:05:23.865
What you're doing now isn't love.

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:26.701
It's a twisted obsession.

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:59.192
You have it all.

00:06:01.861 --> 00:06:04.155
You even have a loving mom.

00:06:07.867 --> 00:06:09.535
But I have nothing.

00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:13.831
So please…

00:06:15.625 --> 00:06:17.251
don't see him.

00:06:27.804 --> 00:06:28.805
Seonbae.

00:06:39.649 --> 00:06:40.566
I…

00:06:43.528 --> 00:06:45.071
don't think I can do this.

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:02.839
I understand where you're coming from.

00:07:07.093 --> 00:07:09.720
I've also thought about
how nice it would have been

00:07:10.221 --> 00:07:12.348
if we were meeting now for the first time.

00:07:15.226 --> 00:07:17.186
I tried hard to resist it,

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:19.147
but I'll admit that I was swayed.

00:07:20.731 --> 00:07:22.650
Even so, I--

00:07:22.733 --> 00:07:23.568
Eun-jung.

00:07:28.781 --> 00:07:30.158
You don't have to explain.

00:07:33.703 --> 00:07:35.413
I understand how you feel.

00:07:39.917 --> 00:07:41.627
I must say, I expected this.

00:07:44.213 --> 00:07:45.798
I let my lingering feelings…

00:07:47.884 --> 00:07:49.427
hurt you once again.

00:07:51.554 --> 00:07:52.472
Don't say that.

00:07:56.601 --> 00:07:57.852
I am sorry

00:07:59.604 --> 00:08:01.230
for turning you down.

00:08:01.814 --> 00:08:04.567
At least a weight's been lifted
now that I've told you.

00:08:08.654 --> 00:08:10.615
I think I can finally move on.

00:08:17.747 --> 00:08:20.458
-Where are you headed?
-To check on the equipment. You?

00:08:20.541 --> 00:08:21.751
-The office?
-Yes.

00:08:24.086 --> 00:08:24.962
Ryu Eun-jung.

00:08:26.088 --> 00:08:28.174
Let's finally enjoy being colleagues.

00:08:30.468 --> 00:08:31.469
Sure.

00:08:33.304 --> 00:08:35.056
I hope we get along, Director Kim.

00:08:37.433 --> 00:08:38.309
Likewise.

00:08:39.227 --> 00:08:40.061
Bye.

00:08:53.449 --> 00:08:54.825
Hello, Producer Ryu.

00:08:58.829 --> 00:08:59.914
Where's Ho-cheol?

00:08:59.997 --> 00:09:00.998
In the bathroom.

00:09:01.082 --> 00:09:03.751
Then shall we start
the technical meeting in ten?

00:09:03.834 --> 00:09:05.294
Sure, since we're short on time.

00:09:10.925 --> 00:09:12.468
How's that sound, Producer Cheon?

00:09:12.552 --> 00:09:13.427
Hello?

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:15.555
Yes, hello.

00:09:16.097 --> 00:09:16.931
Yes.

00:09:17.014 --> 00:09:18.182
Did something happen?

00:09:22.103 --> 00:09:25.106
The update for the fifth shoot
is the lead actors' waiting area.

00:09:27.108 --> 00:09:29.485
The waiting area is a bit far
from the parking lot.

00:09:29.569 --> 00:09:30.820
It's fine where it is.

00:09:30.903 --> 00:09:34.031
Even if it's far,
they'll get more privacy during breaks.

00:09:35.992 --> 00:09:39.203
What did the assistant director say
about the actors' call times?

00:09:39.704 --> 00:09:42.164
We'll start at 9:00 a.m.,
so they can come in by 7:30,

00:09:42.248 --> 00:09:43.958
but Lee's always late, so 7:00 a.m.

00:09:44.667 --> 00:09:47.628
I think doing that from day one
might backfire.

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:53.050
I agree that we should start
with a call time of 7:30.

00:09:53.134 --> 00:09:53.968
Okay.

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:58.139
How early does
Director Gyeong usually arrive?

00:10:04.437 --> 00:10:06.314
-Producer Cheon?
-The sixth update.

00:10:09.275 --> 00:10:10.276
Aren't we moving on?

00:10:12.612 --> 00:10:14.739
Shall we move on to the sixth shoot, then?

00:10:15.239 --> 00:10:16.073
Yes.

00:10:20.036 --> 00:10:22.079
-Great work, everyone.
-Great work.

00:10:24.707 --> 00:10:25.791
We need to talk.

00:10:28.461 --> 00:10:29.670
I have a meeting.

00:10:35.676 --> 00:10:36.844
I swear,

00:10:37.845 --> 00:10:40.931
I never told the bastard to invest.

00:10:41.432 --> 00:10:43.851
He practically begged me to include him,

00:10:44.352 --> 00:10:46.896
but he's suing me
now that things have gone south.

00:10:47.605 --> 00:10:49.440
How much did you scam off him?

00:10:49.523 --> 00:10:50.566
Hey, I didn't scam--

00:10:57.365 --> 00:10:58.449
120 million.

00:11:02.244 --> 00:11:03.996
I'm not asking you to cover it all.

00:11:05.915 --> 00:11:06.916
Just 80 million.

00:11:12.004 --> 00:11:13.464
You work at a major company,

00:11:15.132 --> 00:11:17.218
so that's doable for you, right?

00:11:19.887 --> 00:11:23.140
Don't worry too much.
Your old man won't go down too easily.

00:11:23.224 --> 00:11:25.393
I'll pick myself up no matter what

00:11:25.476 --> 00:11:26.310
and repay you--

00:11:55.798 --> 00:11:57.007
I'll give you the money.

00:11:58.467 --> 00:11:59.385
Just wait.

00:12:01.929 --> 00:12:03.889
In return, never show your face again.

00:12:05.808 --> 00:12:06.767
Of course.

00:12:07.393 --> 00:12:09.270
This really is the last time.

00:12:16.235 --> 00:12:17.403
Sang-yeon.

00:12:18.195 --> 00:12:20.406
These are new, damn it.

00:12:21.741 --> 00:12:23.075
When do you think

00:12:23.951 --> 00:12:25.286
you can get the money?

00:12:28.831 --> 00:12:30.374
Dang, it's scuffed.

00:12:35.379 --> 00:12:37.131
How could you afford new shoes?

00:12:40.843 --> 00:12:42.261
I guess she didn't tell you.

00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:47.808
She said she was your colleague.
This fair, young lady.

00:12:53.397 --> 00:12:54.982
You received money from her?

00:12:58.986 --> 00:13:00.321
Please tell me you didn't.

00:13:13.417 --> 00:13:15.294
What's keeping you so busy?

00:13:15.377 --> 00:13:17.213
I'm just brewing some tea.

00:13:19.131 --> 00:13:22.134
Why would I be busy?
You're the one who's busy.

00:13:23.761 --> 00:13:25.805
Why don't you drink the coffee I…

00:13:25.888 --> 00:13:26.764
Right.

00:13:26.847 --> 00:13:28.933
I've been liking tea these days.

00:13:30.142 --> 00:13:31.519
I'll drink this instead.

00:13:33.145 --> 00:13:35.356
Did you say filming starts in two days?

00:13:38.526 --> 00:13:41.111
So, Yeong-seo met Jae-han before Min-ju

00:13:41.195 --> 00:13:43.697
through an online music society
in middle school.

00:13:50.329 --> 00:13:51.580
-Director Ju.
-Yes?

00:13:52.665 --> 00:13:55.334
Did you meet Producer Cheon Sang-yeon?

00:13:57.878 --> 00:14:01.006
Well, yes. She stopped by a few days ago.

00:14:03.926 --> 00:14:06.679
She seemed concerned
that I wasn't attending the ritual.

00:14:07.471 --> 00:14:10.558
She's nicer than I expected
and has plenty of great ideas too.

00:14:32.663 --> 00:14:33.706
It's one million won.

00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:43.257
Why stick your nose in my business?

00:14:44.133 --> 00:14:45.342
You know how much

00:14:46.343 --> 00:14:48.012
I hate it when you do that.

00:14:50.389 --> 00:14:52.182
Keep out of my business for good.

00:14:54.685 --> 00:14:56.312
I was planning on it.

00:14:58.147 --> 00:15:00.399
I heard you went to Director Ju's studio.

00:15:04.570 --> 00:15:06.238
Did you read our treatment?

00:15:07.489 --> 00:15:08.324
Yes.

00:15:09.909 --> 00:15:12.328
He emailed it to me.

00:15:13.787 --> 00:15:16.373
-Without even telling me?
-Should he have?

00:15:19.585 --> 00:15:20.836
Isn't it obvious?

00:15:22.129 --> 00:15:24.840
Sneaking a look at a film treatment,

00:15:24.924 --> 00:15:27.760
especially before our team lead's review,
is out of line.

00:15:27.843 --> 00:15:29.511
I only dropped by

00:15:30.346 --> 00:15:33.307
because he missed the ritual.
The rest just happened.

00:15:34.224 --> 00:15:37.728
I'm sorry if I offended you.
I’ll be more careful going forward.

00:15:55.204 --> 00:15:56.205
And cut!

00:15:56.288 --> 00:15:57.331
-Cut!
-Play that back.

00:15:57.831 --> 00:15:59.959
We're checking the shot, everyone.

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:02.670
Who suggested we call him at 7:30?

00:16:03.504 --> 00:16:05.297
Call him half an hour earlier tomorrow.

00:16:05.381 --> 00:16:07.257
-Okay.
-That won't be nearly enough.

00:16:07.341 --> 00:16:10.469
-He arrived after 8:00 a.m. today.
-Man, he's really something.

00:16:14.390 --> 00:16:16.558
No photos, please! No photos!

00:16:22.356 --> 00:16:24.358
We're filming all day, so I'll be late.

00:16:24.441 --> 00:16:25.859
You have shoots every day.

00:16:26.902 --> 00:16:28.028
It's still early stages.

00:16:29.029 --> 00:16:30.990
Eventually, I'll just attend
the key scenes.

00:16:32.783 --> 00:16:34.785
Have you made up with Sang-yeon?

00:16:38.539 --> 00:16:39.665
How much did you hear?

00:16:40.457 --> 00:16:42.334
Just whatever I could make out.

00:16:43.585 --> 00:16:46.171
Go on and patch things up.
You're not kids anymore.

00:16:46.714 --> 00:16:48.132
There's nothing to patch up.

00:16:48.632 --> 00:16:51.427
When backed into a corner,
people will go to great lengths--

00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:52.344
Mom.

00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:57.182
How is she backed into a corner?

00:16:58.726 --> 00:17:00.686
Whatever. Just don’t even mention her.

00:17:09.361 --> 00:17:11.196
So I can't take out a loan?

00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:15.701
You would be eligible for the government's
Sunshine Loan or New Hope Loan.

00:17:15.784 --> 00:17:17.911
The Sunshine Loan
offers up to ten million won,

00:17:17.995 --> 00:17:19.621
and the New Hope Loan provides…

00:17:19.705 --> 00:17:21.582
I called earlier, but I'll try again.

00:17:21.665 --> 00:17:23.000
-Okay.
-Hi, Producer Ryu.

00:17:25.461 --> 00:17:26.587
Is he still not here?

00:17:26.670 --> 00:17:27.921
Don't get me started.

00:17:28.005 --> 00:17:30.591
If it were up to me,
I'd expose him so badly.

00:17:30.674 --> 00:17:31.508
What about Su-a?

00:17:31.592 --> 00:17:32.801
Already here, of course.

00:17:32.885 --> 00:17:35.846
If it were any other actress,
they would never wait this long.

00:17:40.642 --> 00:17:41.643
There he is.

00:17:49.151 --> 00:17:50.694
Cut. Okay.

00:17:50.778 --> 00:17:52.696
Yes. Okay, let's eat now.

00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:55.115
Enjoy your lunch,
and be back here by 2 p.m., please.

00:17:55.199 --> 00:17:56.408
-Okay.
-Okay, by 2 p.m.!

00:17:56.492 --> 00:17:57.326
Great work, guys.

00:17:57.409 --> 00:17:58.535
Aren't you having lunch?

00:18:00.537 --> 00:18:02.206
I need to clear my head first.

00:18:05.918 --> 00:18:08.253
The company should speak to his people.

00:18:10.214 --> 00:18:12.758
Is this about Seung-jae being late?

00:18:12.841 --> 00:18:13.842
That's one issue.

00:18:14.343 --> 00:18:16.887
He knows we have
back-to-back shoots in Gangneung

00:18:16.970 --> 00:18:18.639
but booked another commercial.

00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:22.434
I understand.

00:18:23.102 --> 00:18:25.938
If you don't feel like having lunch,
shall I buy you something?

00:18:26.021 --> 00:18:27.064
No, I'm good.

00:18:28.398 --> 00:18:30.275
-I'll leave you to it, then.
-Okay.

00:18:30.818 --> 00:18:31.693
Hello?

00:18:34.738 --> 00:18:36.073
Ten million won?

00:18:37.282 --> 00:18:39.118
Okay, I'll take the loan, then.

00:18:39.785 --> 00:18:42.079
Yes, all right. Thank you.

00:18:42.162 --> 00:18:44.414
You're not going to help your dad,
are you?

00:18:45.999 --> 00:18:48.335
It's only right
to cut off leeching parents.

00:18:48.836 --> 00:18:51.463
A dad who can't buy his daughter
a winter coat is no dad.

00:19:07.813 --> 00:19:08.814
Right.

00:19:09.314 --> 00:19:10.149
Okay.

00:19:11.441 --> 00:19:13.610
-What did they say?
-He's coming.

00:19:13.694 --> 00:19:16.530
They didn't specify when
but just said, "Coming," then hung up.

00:19:17.948 --> 00:19:19.283
What was on the schedule?

00:19:19.366 --> 00:19:21.076
What? Wait, Su-a is leaving.

00:19:21.785 --> 00:19:23.287
I'll get Director Gyeong.

00:19:24.204 --> 00:19:25.247
Su-a!

00:19:25.956 --> 00:19:27.416
Su-a, please wait!

00:19:35.966 --> 00:19:36.925
Come on, sir.

00:19:37.009 --> 00:19:38.635
What time do you call this?

00:19:40.012 --> 00:19:41.930
Who sent out the location?

00:19:42.639 --> 00:19:44.975
Who the heck
sent out the location address?

00:19:46.351 --> 00:19:47.186
I did.

00:19:47.269 --> 00:19:48.478
You.

00:19:48.562 --> 00:19:50.397
Do you know where I went, thanks to you?

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:52.149
I went all the way to Ssangmun-dong.

00:19:52.232 --> 00:19:54.526
I texted again
to tell you it was Myeonmok-dong.

00:19:55.027 --> 00:19:57.237
-Didn't you receive my--
-So we got it wrong?

00:19:57.946 --> 00:19:59.323
-Is that it?
-Well, I clearly--

00:19:59.406 --> 00:20:01.116
Seung-jae, you can talk to me--

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:03.076
Did you say "clearly"?

00:20:06.205 --> 00:20:07.331
You clearly didn't.

00:20:07.414 --> 00:20:10.334
Otherwise, why the fuck
did I end up at Ssangmun-dong?

00:20:11.501 --> 00:20:12.544
For fuck's sake…

00:20:15.339 --> 00:20:16.840
Did you just cuss at me?

00:20:17.966 --> 00:20:19.134
I did no such thing.

00:20:20.177 --> 00:20:21.011
You prick.

00:20:24.264 --> 00:20:26.183
Hey, hit me if you want.

00:20:26.767 --> 00:20:28.393
Go on. Hit me!

00:20:29.978 --> 00:20:31.813
What did I even do wrong?

00:20:33.232 --> 00:20:34.274
You little bastard…

00:20:41.615 --> 00:20:42.658
What the…

00:20:42.741 --> 00:20:43.575
Let go.

00:20:44.534 --> 00:20:45.619
I said let go, damn it!

00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:48.956
Director Kim,
what do you think you're doing?

00:20:51.875 --> 00:20:52.918
Let go of him.

00:20:56.546 --> 00:20:58.548
You're not the only one making this movie.

00:20:59.424 --> 00:21:00.801
Please apologize to Ho-cheol.

00:21:03.512 --> 00:21:04.763
Fucking hell.

00:21:07.432 --> 00:21:09.559
I can't act today because my arm hurts.

00:21:10.394 --> 00:21:13.146
I can't do this! Got it, you bastard?

00:21:15.732 --> 00:21:18.402
And don't you fucking dare
apologize to me.

00:21:18.902 --> 00:21:20.570
I won't accept your apology.

00:21:26.034 --> 00:21:27.786
Seung-jae, talk to me.

00:21:30.706 --> 00:21:31.623
Seung-jae.

00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:52.769
Lee Seung-jae's people

00:21:52.853 --> 00:21:55.230
want us to hire another cinematographer.

00:21:58.317 --> 00:21:59.443
What does Gyeong say?

00:22:00.777 --> 00:22:01.820
He won't allow it.

00:22:04.364 --> 00:22:08.744
The agency executive insists that
Director Kim should personally apologize.

00:22:09.661 --> 00:22:11.538
But Director Kim says no way in hell.

00:22:12.664 --> 00:22:14.958
He never said that, actually.

00:22:15.542 --> 00:22:18.295
He's willing to apologize,
but only if Lee Seung-jae

00:22:18.378 --> 00:22:20.130
first apologizes to Ho-cheol.

00:22:20.213 --> 00:22:21.381
It's the same thing.

00:22:25.802 --> 00:22:27.637
His agency has put on a hard front,

00:22:27.721 --> 00:22:30.432
but I'm sure
they're just as anxious as we are.

00:22:32.059 --> 00:22:33.477
Our best course of action

00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:36.772
is to give him a valid reason
to return to set.

00:22:36.855 --> 00:22:39.358
And how on earth will we do that?

00:22:39.441 --> 00:22:41.443
What if Ho-cheol apologizes?

00:22:45.697 --> 00:22:47.115
Ho-cheol is the victim here.

00:22:47.199 --> 00:22:50.619
If he hadn’t reacted
to Lee Seung-jae's initial provocations,

00:22:50.702 --> 00:22:52.371
things wouldn't have blown up.

00:22:52.454 --> 00:22:54.748
Ho-cheol's apology
could be a valid reason.

00:22:54.831 --> 00:22:56.208
I can't agree to that.

00:22:56.291 --> 00:23:00.253
Over 80% of our difficulties on set
are caused by Lee Seung-jae.

00:23:01.088 --> 00:23:04.341
He ignores call times
and adjusts the schedule on a whim.

00:23:04.424 --> 00:23:06.343
We should address everything now.

00:23:06.843 --> 00:23:09.930
Do you really think that will work?
We just don't have time for that.

00:23:10.514 --> 00:23:12.432
This Ho-cheol guy, will he apologize?

00:23:12.516 --> 00:23:13.475
Sir.

00:23:13.558 --> 00:23:15.894
Yes, he feels responsible.

00:23:17.771 --> 00:23:19.981
Are you sure you didn't guilt him into it?

00:23:20.482 --> 00:23:23.568
Even if he’s willing to apologize,
we can’t let him do that.

00:23:23.652 --> 00:23:25.237
The entire crew saw what happened.

00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:27.614
What would they think
if Ho-cheol apologized

00:23:27.697 --> 00:23:29.950
after he was hit by Lee Seung-jae?

00:23:30.033 --> 00:23:30.867
Producer Ryu.

00:23:33.495 --> 00:23:36.665
Who do you think is crucial
in making this movie?

00:23:41.044 --> 00:23:42.003
It’s not me

00:23:42.671 --> 00:23:44.131
nor you, Producer Ryu.

00:23:45.424 --> 00:23:47.717
It's not even Director Gyeong Seung-ju.

00:23:49.678 --> 00:23:51.304
We are all replaceable.

00:23:52.973 --> 00:23:54.558
But not Lee Seung-jae.

00:23:55.851 --> 00:23:59.354
Without him,
this entire project falls apart.

00:24:01.064 --> 00:24:02.315
At this rate,

00:24:02.941 --> 00:24:05.610
we won't finish filming
before he's drafted, anyway.

00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:09.990
Which is why we need this resolved.

00:24:10.490 --> 00:24:12.617
Do you think
Ho-cheol’s apology will be enough?

00:24:13.118 --> 00:24:14.369
Mr. Jeong.

00:24:14.453 --> 00:24:15.662
We'll make it be enough.

00:24:16.955 --> 00:24:17.998
I'll try

00:24:18.707 --> 00:24:20.250
convincing Lee Seung-jae.

00:24:27.466 --> 00:24:28.592
That rude prick.

00:24:30.469 --> 00:24:32.137
Let’s call it a day for now.

00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:34.890
Tomorrow's shoot is canceled,
and maybe even the day after.

00:24:34.973 --> 00:24:36.266
Even the day after tomorrow?

00:24:36.933 --> 00:24:40.187
Ho-cheol has agreed to apologize,
so I’ll keep you all updated.

00:24:40.937 --> 00:24:42.564
Wait, Ho-cheol's apologizing?

00:24:45.692 --> 00:24:46.693
Ho-cheol.

00:24:48.945 --> 00:24:50.989
Did you say that you would apologize?

00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:55.160
What other choice do we have?

00:24:56.203 --> 00:24:57.829
If I get the movie shut down--

00:24:57.913 --> 00:24:59.915
Who said that would happen?

00:25:00.415 --> 00:25:02.042
It won't get shut down.

00:25:03.418 --> 00:25:04.544
And you're the one

00:25:04.628 --> 00:25:07.214
who should be receiving an apology.

00:25:14.179 --> 00:25:15.722
Go and get some rest for now.

00:25:17.015 --> 00:25:18.308
I'll just apologize.

00:25:19.851 --> 00:25:21.061
It's only right.

00:25:21.561 --> 00:25:22.687
How would that be right?

00:25:22.771 --> 00:25:24.397
Once word gets out about this,

00:25:25.565 --> 00:25:26.691
who would hire me?

00:25:26.775 --> 00:25:28.068
I'll hire you.

00:25:29.152 --> 00:25:31.655
Besides, I can find you a project to join

00:25:31.738 --> 00:25:34.282
that's not ours, if need be.

00:25:40.914 --> 00:25:43.291
Director Kim says he'll apologize.

00:25:47.587 --> 00:25:49.130
Are you sure about this?

00:25:49.214 --> 00:25:51.258
I prefer this over Ho-cheol apologizing.

00:25:52.384 --> 00:25:56.429
How could I face Lee Seung-jae again
if Ho-cheol apologizes?

00:25:58.306 --> 00:25:59.224
Thank you.

00:25:59.933 --> 00:26:02.894
Don't thank me.
Where do I need to go tomorrow?

00:26:06.898 --> 00:26:08.191
Look at that fruit basket.

00:26:08.692 --> 00:26:11.444
Do you really need to apologize?
This is pissing me off.

00:26:11.528 --> 00:26:12.988
It's the gesture that counts.

00:26:13.071 --> 00:26:14.698
I'm off. Check on the equipment.

00:26:15.490 --> 00:26:16.491
Damn it.

00:26:21.288 --> 00:26:22.706
Well done for coming.

00:26:23.873 --> 00:26:25.542
Nothing comes easy, does it?

00:26:26.835 --> 00:26:28.003
Let's go inside.

00:26:30.005 --> 00:26:31.006
This way.

00:26:34.467 --> 00:26:35.677
Lee Seung-jae.

00:26:36.177 --> 00:26:37.178
Right here.

00:26:39.514 --> 00:26:41.141
Wait out here for a moment.

00:26:41.766 --> 00:26:42.684
And this.

00:26:43.184 --> 00:26:45.103
Let's just say Director Kim bought this.

00:27:03.246 --> 00:27:04.372
Seung-jae.

00:27:04.956 --> 00:27:06.583
How are you feeling?

00:27:08.418 --> 00:27:10.295
He'll be in the hospital for two weeks.

00:27:11.463 --> 00:27:13.006
My goodness.

00:27:13.089 --> 00:27:15.675
Of course, your recovery
is our highest priority.

00:27:16.259 --> 00:27:19.429
But I think
there's been a misunderstanding.

00:27:20.889 --> 00:27:23.475
He's waiting out there to apologize.
What should we do?

00:27:25.602 --> 00:27:27.312
You said you'd get him fired.

00:27:28.104 --> 00:27:29.022
Come on.

00:27:29.105 --> 00:27:31.941
We need to finish the movie
before you're drafted.

00:27:32.442 --> 00:27:34.069
Damn it.

00:27:34.152 --> 00:27:36.529
Seeing his face might be too triggering.

00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:40.241
You should at least
give him a chance to apologize.

00:27:44.454 --> 00:27:46.081
Let's have him come in.

00:27:56.883 --> 00:28:00.053
Would you look at that?
Director Kim brought you a fruit basket!

00:28:00.553 --> 00:28:01.930
Wow, these look great.

00:28:02.013 --> 00:28:04.474
Vitamins do help with a swift recovery.

00:28:05.392 --> 00:28:07.227
They sure look ripe.

00:28:13.650 --> 00:28:14.901
I'm sorry, Seung-jae.

00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:17.362
I sincerely apologize.

00:28:28.331 --> 00:28:31.042
Come on, Director Kim is apologizing.

00:28:31.543 --> 00:28:32.377
What do you say?

00:28:38.633 --> 00:28:39.676
I apologize.

00:28:40.176 --> 00:28:41.386
Truly.

00:28:46.433 --> 00:28:47.851
You don't seem sorry at all.

00:28:51.855 --> 00:28:52.939
Did you just laugh?

00:28:54.107 --> 00:28:55.692
He's laughing because he's sorry.

00:28:55.775 --> 00:28:57.193
Who apologizes

00:28:58.528 --> 00:28:59.988
while snickering like that?

00:29:02.490 --> 00:29:03.658
Get out.

00:29:10.165 --> 00:29:11.082
Seung-jae.

00:29:19.299 --> 00:29:22.093
-Sang-yeon.
-I should have apologized sooner.

00:29:23.386 --> 00:29:24.471
I'm sorry.

00:29:25.305 --> 00:29:27.640
We gave you the wrong information,

00:29:28.808 --> 00:29:29.893
so please forgive us.

00:29:30.894 --> 00:29:32.312
Why are you…

00:29:39.694 --> 00:29:40.904
Good work, everyone.

00:29:44.115 --> 00:29:45.366
You did well, Director Kim.

00:29:46.576 --> 00:29:47.702
You too, Producer Cheon.

00:29:49.996 --> 00:29:53.291
You guys take the car to set.
I'll just catch a cab.

00:29:56.920 --> 00:29:58.797
He said he'd return, so we're good.

00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:01.466
Lighten up, everyone.
You too, Producer Ryu.

00:30:02.008 --> 00:30:03.134
Start the car, Yu-chan.

00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:04.761
I'm leaving.

00:30:25.573 --> 00:30:26.658
We need to talk.

00:30:34.707 --> 00:30:36.251
Why did you have to go that far?

00:30:36.918 --> 00:30:38.294
Shouldn't you be thanking me?

00:30:38.878 --> 00:30:41.673
-Why would I thank you?
-It was either me on my knees or seonbae.

00:30:43.049 --> 00:30:46.052
You wouldn't let Ho-cheol apologize.
How would you bear it if he--

00:30:46.135 --> 00:30:48.263
It doesn't matter who was apologizing.

00:30:48.346 --> 00:30:50.598
We both know nobody owed him an apology.

00:30:51.099 --> 00:30:53.393
Why would you get on your knees
when he's the one…

00:30:55.228 --> 00:30:56.271
Are you okay

00:30:56.354 --> 00:30:58.565
with Ho-cheol apologizing

00:30:59.232 --> 00:31:01.234
but not with seonbae doing so?

00:31:08.575 --> 00:31:10.493
I get you like him,
but don't stoop so low.

00:31:11.828 --> 00:31:14.956
Don't go so far for anyone,
not even for yourself.

00:31:16.124 --> 00:31:18.209
That's not how to get things done.

00:31:18.293 --> 00:31:21.170
I don't understand what you mean by that,

00:31:21.671 --> 00:31:23.339
but at least I get things done.

00:31:23.423 --> 00:31:24.883
Unlike you, who's all talk.

00:31:24.966 --> 00:31:26.634
What have you resolved?

00:31:27.886 --> 00:31:31.222
What you gave him today
wasn't just a reason to return.

00:31:31.764 --> 00:31:33.516
You handed him a crown.

00:31:34.434 --> 00:31:36.311
One that enables him to do as he pleases.

00:31:36.811 --> 00:31:38.396
To keep being late.

00:31:38.479 --> 00:31:42.358
To act violently toward others
without facing any repercussions--

00:31:42.442 --> 00:31:45.570
But he is the king here.
At the top of the food chain.

00:31:46.779 --> 00:31:50.158
Consider the money we lose
each day that filming is delayed.

00:31:55.330 --> 00:31:58.333
You're lucky you have time
to worry about such petty things.

00:31:59.375 --> 00:32:00.543
Yes, Director.

00:32:01.044 --> 00:32:02.629
Yes, we just got back.

00:32:06.883 --> 00:32:08.593
Is he really that incredible?

00:32:09.677 --> 00:32:10.803
Why would you…

00:32:11.554 --> 00:32:13.681
Why get on your knees because of some guy?

00:32:17.602 --> 00:32:20.438
You're on about that kneeling thing too.

00:32:22.065 --> 00:32:23.691
Can't you just let it go?

00:32:24.192 --> 00:32:26.069
Why the hell would you do such a thing?

00:32:26.653 --> 00:32:28.196
You wouldn't kneel to anyone--

00:32:28.279 --> 00:32:29.864
Precisely.

00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:32.951
So can't you, of all people,

00:32:33.034 --> 00:32:35.370
just say "well done" and move on?

00:32:41.584 --> 00:32:43.336
You don't see him as a man.

00:32:43.836 --> 00:32:47.173
A woman in love doesn't do that.
This is more like an obsession.

00:32:49.425 --> 00:32:50.593
You called me for this?

00:32:50.677 --> 00:32:52.136
Yes, I called you to say this.

00:32:53.262 --> 00:32:55.098
Because I was so stunned.

00:33:00.019 --> 00:33:03.856
When you see Seung-jae tomorrow,
please greet him with a smile.

00:33:08.069 --> 00:33:09.153
A boycott?

00:33:09.237 --> 00:33:11.948
The entire crew is boycotting the shoot.

00:33:12.031 --> 00:33:16.285
They want Lee Seung-jae to apologize
and Producer Cheon to leave the project.

00:33:18.871 --> 00:33:21.374
They were shocked
that she made Ho-cheol apologize,

00:33:21.457 --> 00:33:24.794
which forced Director Kim to step in
and apologize instead.

00:33:25.962 --> 00:33:28.965
First off,
Seung-jae should apologize to Ho-cheol.

00:33:29.048 --> 00:33:32.051
-Then Producer Cheon should drop out--
-I don't need an apology.

00:33:33.553 --> 00:33:34.387
I'm sorry.

00:33:35.221 --> 00:33:36.806
You have no reason to be.

00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:39.308
Where is everyone right now?

00:33:41.060 --> 00:33:42.770
-I'll try to--
-I'll drop out.

00:33:46.315 --> 00:33:47.191
That solves

00:33:48.317 --> 00:33:49.861
at least one problem, right?

00:33:52.780 --> 00:33:54.282
-Producer Cheon.
-I'll go.

00:33:58.327 --> 00:34:00.288
Why won't you tell them the truth?

00:34:00.371 --> 00:34:02.582
They'd change their minds
if they knew what you did.

00:34:02.665 --> 00:34:04.375
For the whole world to know?

00:34:07.712 --> 00:34:08.796
I don't want that.

00:34:12.133 --> 00:34:13.593
Please just let this end

00:34:14.719 --> 00:34:16.137
with me leaving the project.

00:34:18.848 --> 00:34:21.434
Hey! Are you really quitting?

00:34:35.448 --> 00:34:39.660
Upper management insists
we resolve this before any media fallout.

00:34:41.079 --> 00:34:44.540
Lee Seung-jae has agreed to express
his regret, so let's settle it at that.

00:34:44.624 --> 00:34:47.460
Be sure to explain this
at the core staff meeting.

00:34:48.961 --> 00:34:50.421
What about Producer Cheon?

00:34:52.507 --> 00:34:54.550
We'll get her working on another script.

00:34:57.053 --> 00:34:58.012
Don't feel bad.

00:34:58.096 --> 00:35:01.182
It is her fault for suggesting
we make Ho-cheol apologize.

00:35:03.726 --> 00:35:05.645
But you agreed to that as well.

00:35:07.855 --> 00:35:10.233
I'm a father of three.
Should I quit instead?

00:35:11.567 --> 00:35:13.361
The project was yours to begin with.

00:35:13.444 --> 00:35:15.988
See this as a blessing,
and let's make it work.

00:35:16.614 --> 00:35:17.448
Okay?

00:35:40.388 --> 00:35:41.430
You cleared your desk?

00:35:41.514 --> 00:35:44.517
I just gave the division head
my letter of resignation.

00:35:46.227 --> 00:35:48.980
What for?
Did they tell you to resign as well?

00:35:49.063 --> 00:35:51.774
I wasn't fired. I chose to resign.

00:35:53.734 --> 00:35:54.569
Why?

00:35:56.529 --> 00:35:57.905
I'd rather not be pathetic.

00:36:02.827 --> 00:36:04.495
Shouldn't you be happy?

00:36:05.288 --> 00:36:06.455
Lucky you.

00:36:06.539 --> 00:36:08.749
Now you get your project back.

00:36:12.795 --> 00:36:14.338
Do you truly think that

00:36:16.215 --> 00:36:18.050
resolving misunderstandings is pathetic?

00:36:20.428 --> 00:36:21.679
That's just who I am.

00:36:26.142 --> 00:36:27.977
How can you give up on things so easily?

00:36:29.687 --> 00:36:31.564
Is your pride that important?

00:36:34.692 --> 00:36:35.526
Yes.

00:36:38.070 --> 00:36:40.031
It's more important than my life.

00:36:45.745 --> 00:36:47.538
Then what does that leave you with?

00:36:50.333 --> 00:36:52.501
If you give everything up
to protect your pride…

00:36:55.046 --> 00:36:56.797
what does that leave you with?

00:37:01.719 --> 00:37:04.055
Stay on the project
for Director Gyeong's sake.

00:37:04.138 --> 00:37:06.140
I'll persuade the crew.

00:37:08.434 --> 00:37:12.146
God, you're so full of it.

00:37:18.653 --> 00:37:21.030
You think you’re a good person, don’t you?

00:37:26.035 --> 00:37:28.162
You simply got lucky.

00:37:37.421 --> 00:37:38.631
You seem to think

00:37:40.049 --> 00:37:42.468
that you were always unlucky.

00:37:45.554 --> 00:37:47.765
But you're the one who made your own luck.

00:37:48.266 --> 00:37:51.352
I hope that you, at least once,
understand how it feels…

00:37:53.187 --> 00:37:54.146
to be truly alone.

00:37:54.230 --> 00:37:55.648
You chose to walk away

00:37:56.983 --> 00:37:59.026
from those who cherished and loved you.

00:38:02.071 --> 00:38:03.489
Ten years ago…

00:38:05.491 --> 00:38:07.994
because you just had to
protect your pride.

00:38:11.539 --> 00:38:13.416
Your loneliness was caused…

00:38:15.418 --> 00:38:16.419
by you.

00:39:00.338 --> 00:39:02.006
I resigned from JD today.

00:39:03.299 --> 00:39:04.133
What?

00:39:07.928 --> 00:39:10.056
I’m on my way back from meeting the crew.

00:39:10.765 --> 00:39:13.059
I've cleared the air,
so you can come back.

00:39:15.603 --> 00:39:17.063
You cleared the air?

00:39:17.146 --> 00:39:18.731
I didn't tell them the details.

00:39:19.315 --> 00:39:21.233
Just that you apologized for me.

00:39:21.901 --> 00:39:24.612
The entire crew should understand by now,

00:39:25.112 --> 00:39:26.405
so there's no issue.

00:39:27.323 --> 00:39:29.784
In other words,
"We've graciously forgiven you,

00:39:30.743 --> 00:39:32.161
so you can come back now."

00:39:34.538 --> 00:39:36.499
I did nothing wrong.

00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:41.796
So please let them know
that I don't need their understanding.

00:39:42.797 --> 00:39:43.631
Sang-yeon.

00:39:43.714 --> 00:39:45.257
It's already been decided.

00:39:52.515 --> 00:39:54.058
Do you have anything more to say?

00:40:04.777 --> 00:40:05.945
Take care.

00:40:12.535 --> 00:40:14.537
Why, do you think I won't do just that?

00:40:19.083 --> 00:40:20.876
You think the same, don't you?

00:40:22.211 --> 00:40:23.712
You think I'm strange.

00:40:23.796 --> 00:40:25.381
I've never said that.

00:40:26.882 --> 00:40:29.385
You should learn to receive
from others for once.

00:40:30.469 --> 00:40:33.305
I'm saying take care of yourself
and find some stability.

00:40:35.766 --> 00:40:37.184
Like Eun-jung, you mean?

00:40:37.268 --> 00:40:38.102
Yes.

00:40:38.185 --> 00:40:39.562
At the very least,

00:40:39.645 --> 00:40:41.605
Eun-jung always protects herself.

00:40:46.235 --> 00:40:48.529
So you do think that.

00:40:50.698 --> 00:40:52.992
You think I walked away from everything.

00:40:55.161 --> 00:40:56.120
Sang-yeon.

00:40:56.203 --> 00:40:57.872
But let me tell you this.

00:41:02.918 --> 00:41:04.628
I did love you.

00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:09.675
You're the one who walked away.

00:41:14.096 --> 00:41:17.683
Nobody willingly ruins themselves.

00:41:22.980 --> 00:41:25.483
Eun-jung would be the same
if she were in my shoes.

00:41:32.072 --> 00:41:32.948
Go now.

00:41:35.576 --> 00:41:38.120
And I hope we never cross paths again.

00:41:41.373 --> 00:41:43.209
You're truly

00:41:44.627 --> 00:41:46.128
a stranger to me now.

00:41:54.637 --> 00:41:56.430
You think the same, don't you?

00:41:56.514 --> 00:41:57.973
You think I'm strange.

00:41:58.057 --> 00:41:59.391
At the very least,

00:42:00.059 --> 00:42:01.769
Eun-jung always protects herself.

00:42:03.521 --> 00:42:05.689
You're the one who made your own luck.

00:42:07.233 --> 00:42:08.859
You chose to walk away.

00:42:10.694 --> 00:42:12.154
Your loneliness was caused…

00:42:14.156 --> 00:42:15.115
by you.

00:42:22.081 --> 00:42:24.250
Why do you look so concerned?

00:42:24.333 --> 00:42:26.210
Everything's finally as it should be.

00:42:28.837 --> 00:42:29.922
Is it really?

00:42:30.005 --> 00:42:31.173
Of course.

00:42:31.674 --> 00:42:33.551
Whatever the case, it all turned out well.

00:42:35.886 --> 00:42:37.763
But why don't I feel pleased?

00:42:41.225 --> 00:42:42.851
Even if it's just once,

00:42:44.144 --> 00:42:47.314
I wish I could truly understand
how Sang-yeon feels.

00:42:49.441 --> 00:42:52.403
I wish I could know
what I did to anger her.

00:42:53.654 --> 00:42:57.199
It's just her personality.
You can't explain people like her.

00:42:57.283 --> 00:42:59.201
She wasn't like this back then.

00:43:00.744 --> 00:43:01.912
Back when?

00:43:04.582 --> 00:43:05.791
Back then.

00:43:08.252 --> 00:43:09.753
Way back when.

00:43:12.339 --> 00:43:15.050
When I think about her,
my mind always runs in circles.

00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:18.596
Ryu Eun-jung.

00:43:21.098 --> 00:43:24.518
Just walk away, okay?
There’s a reason it never worked out.

00:43:25.185 --> 00:43:27.396
Why keep trying to understand her?

00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:31.775
You seem relieved,
not having to deal with me anymore.

00:43:34.778 --> 00:43:35.613
Of course.

00:43:36.614 --> 00:43:38.073
I am super relieved.

00:43:38.741 --> 00:43:40.367
Don't drink too fast though.

00:43:40.451 --> 00:43:43.370
You shouldn't, but I will.

00:43:45.914 --> 00:43:46.915
I'm free.

00:43:47.750 --> 00:43:50.669
What do you mean you’re free?
You're unemployed now.

00:43:52.671 --> 00:43:54.506
I finally quit

00:43:56.300 --> 00:43:57.593
Kim Sang-hak.

00:44:02.097 --> 00:44:02.931
You did?

00:44:08.812 --> 00:44:10.814
Well done.

00:44:13.025 --> 00:44:14.652
But why quit the company too?

00:44:15.152 --> 00:44:16.445
You need the paycheck.

00:44:18.781 --> 00:44:20.741
A monthly paycheck isn’t nearly enough.

00:44:22.326 --> 00:44:23.535
Just you wait.

00:44:25.079 --> 00:44:25.913
I will…

00:44:31.085 --> 00:44:33.379
make a ton of money.

00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:38.676
And when I do,

00:44:39.843 --> 00:44:42.429
I'll help you make all the films you want.

00:44:45.432 --> 00:44:46.558
I'm grateful.

00:44:47.643 --> 00:44:48.936
You do know, don't you?

00:44:53.774 --> 00:44:55.609
That I can do anything.

00:44:58.612 --> 00:44:59.613
Of course.

00:45:01.699 --> 00:45:02.700
Cheon Sang-yeon

00:45:03.701 --> 00:45:05.202
can do anything.

00:45:07.996 --> 00:45:09.415
Do you really know it though?

00:45:14.795 --> 00:45:17.089
I really can do anything.

00:45:28.684 --> 00:45:30.436
It should take around five minutes.

00:45:36.608 --> 00:45:37.943
Just a little more.

00:45:45.492 --> 00:45:46.326
Hello.

00:45:46.410 --> 00:45:48.036
-Hey.
-Yes, hello.

00:45:48.662 --> 00:45:49.872
Let's do that. Okay.

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:55.210
Let's roll once our body double's ready.

00:45:55.294 --> 00:45:56.128
Yes, sir.

00:45:56.211 --> 00:45:57.212
Yes, we're ready.

00:45:57.296 --> 00:45:58.130
We're ready.

00:45:58.213 --> 00:45:59.590
-On standby.
-Standby.

00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:02.801
There you are.

00:46:03.552 --> 00:46:05.471
It's great seeing you here, Director Han.

00:46:05.554 --> 00:46:07.097
Likewise, sir.

00:46:08.223 --> 00:46:10.476
Were you two always close?

00:46:11.268 --> 00:46:12.311
Well,

00:46:12.811 --> 00:46:15.731
I can't say we're close.
That's giving me too much credit.

00:46:16.231 --> 00:46:17.691
You're too generous.

00:46:18.776 --> 00:46:21.904
A producer as bright and talented
as Producer Cheon is a rare find.

00:46:37.252 --> 00:46:39.171
DIRECTOR JU DONG-HYANG

00:46:43.550 --> 00:46:45.344
I hope you've been well, Director Ju.

00:46:46.345 --> 00:46:50.516
I was in the area and thought of you,
so I figured I should call.

00:46:51.809 --> 00:46:52.643
Yes.

00:46:53.977 --> 00:46:55.687
You're at your studio?

00:46:57.314 --> 00:46:58.899
May I stop by for a moment, then?

00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:01.401
All right.

00:47:07.032 --> 00:47:08.283
What did they say?

00:47:08.784 --> 00:47:10.994
The demolition's been postponed
for five days.

00:47:11.078 --> 00:47:12.538
That's great.

00:47:13.038 --> 00:47:14.957
How on earth did you convince them?

00:47:15.040 --> 00:47:16.458
In the end, they wanted money.

00:47:16.959 --> 00:47:18.669
Why didn't they just say so?

00:47:18.752 --> 00:47:20.212
Now we can finally breathe.

00:47:21.046 --> 00:47:22.589
-Thank you.
-No worries.

00:47:22.673 --> 00:47:24.716
-Director Gyeong, we're ready.
-Okay.

00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:26.051
All right. Shall we roll?

00:47:30.222 --> 00:47:31.223
Sang-yeon?

00:47:32.558 --> 00:47:35.018
-Mrs. Jang.
-So it is you, Sang-yeon.

00:47:35.102 --> 00:47:36.895
What brings you here at this hour?

00:47:36.979 --> 00:47:39.231
Oh, but Eun-jung's in Gangneung.

00:47:39.314 --> 00:47:41.859
I know. I'm not here to see her.

00:47:41.942 --> 00:47:44.611
Really? Then are you here to see me?

00:47:45.737 --> 00:47:46.572
Yes.

00:47:47.239 --> 00:47:49.741
I missed you too. It's good to see you.

00:47:49.825 --> 00:47:51.743
You haven't eaten yet, have you? Let's go.

00:47:55.497 --> 00:47:57.124
I have to leave soon.

00:47:57.708 --> 00:47:59.626
I only came here to see you.

00:48:00.544 --> 00:48:03.380
You're leaving without even having dinner?

00:48:04.298 --> 00:48:05.215
Mrs. Jang.

00:48:05.299 --> 00:48:06.133
Yes?

00:48:10.929 --> 00:48:12.514
I know I'm a bitch…

00:48:15.559 --> 00:48:17.436
but could you give me a hug, please?

00:48:56.350 --> 00:48:57.559
I should go.

00:48:58.226 --> 00:48:59.227
Sang-yeon.

00:49:01.647 --> 00:49:02.856
Come again, okay?

00:49:09.571 --> 00:49:10.489
Yes, Mrs. Jang.

00:49:10.989 --> 00:49:11.823
Good.

00:49:15.661 --> 00:49:16.954
Goodbye.

00:49:22.834 --> 00:49:25.128
-Hello.
-Hey, where are you off to?

00:49:25.212 --> 00:49:26.505
I'm going fishing.

00:49:26.588 --> 00:49:29.549
I'm going to an Internet café
to get some serious gaming in.

00:49:30.050 --> 00:49:31.927
They're pumped to finally get a day off.

00:49:32.010 --> 00:49:34.221
-What are you up to?
-I'm going to eat and sleep.

00:49:35.055 --> 00:49:36.014
Me too.

00:49:36.098 --> 00:49:37.182
-See you.
-Have fun.

00:49:37.265 --> 00:49:38.517
-Bye.
-Goodbye.

00:49:38.600 --> 00:49:39.768
Go on ahead.

00:49:42.938 --> 00:49:44.022
Hey, Hui-jin.

00:49:44.898 --> 00:49:47.067
Me? I'm chilling, of course.

00:49:47.567 --> 00:49:49.695
Did you hear the buzz about our day off?

00:49:51.822 --> 00:49:52.656
What?

00:49:56.076 --> 00:49:57.035
She took what?

00:50:08.171 --> 00:50:10.674
What do you mean she took everything?

00:50:11.299 --> 00:50:13.969
Cheon Sang-yeon and Director Han Jae-jun
launched a company together,

00:50:14.469 --> 00:50:17.973
and JD invested ten billion won
in return for 100% of the company shares.

00:50:18.056 --> 00:50:21.685
The kicker is that Director Ju Dong-hyang
has decided to leave with her.

00:50:22.978 --> 00:50:26.815
I hear her primary condition
was securing Young Hearts.

00:50:49.713 --> 00:50:50.881
There you are.

00:50:58.764 --> 00:51:00.098
How do you like the name Swallow?

00:51:03.268 --> 00:51:04.436
The name of my company.

00:51:06.271 --> 00:51:07.981
Swallow Pictures.

00:51:13.653 --> 00:51:15.822
Is it true
that you'll be taking Young Hearts?

00:51:15.906 --> 00:51:16.907
I already did.

00:51:16.990 --> 00:51:17.949
No.

00:51:20.035 --> 00:51:21.244
You can't take it.

00:51:24.539 --> 00:51:26.124
This is stealing.

00:51:27.834 --> 00:51:29.336
Stealing someone else's project.

00:51:29.419 --> 00:51:31.755
I'm not stealing just anyone's project.

00:51:32.672 --> 00:51:34.841
I'm stealing yours.

00:51:43.308 --> 00:51:44.142
Why?

00:51:45.894 --> 00:51:47.020
Why are you doing this to me?

00:51:52.317 --> 00:51:53.819
I hate that you're fine.

00:52:01.284 --> 00:52:03.161
I want to see you ruined,

00:52:04.621 --> 00:52:05.622
like me.

00:55:43.048 --> 00:55:48.053
