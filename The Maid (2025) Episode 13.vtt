=Episode 13=

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.080
Shen Yuqing.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.040
You killed Que'nu and Lin Jifu.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.440
I thought you were a big deal.

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:50.720
Never imagined

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.320
you would try to fool me

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.320
with such a simple trick of the eyes.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.000
Li Si.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.560
As Chief Constable
of Capital Prefecture,

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.880
you willingly became
the Duchess's hound,

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:10.360
desecrating graves

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.600
and destroying corpses.

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.280
These are capital crimes.

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:17.720
Aren't you afraid

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.640
you'll die a horrible death?

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:21.560
What?

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.320
This isn't your mother's corpse?

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.160
If you were Shen Yuqing,

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:31.480
would you leave

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:32.880
your own mother's corpse here

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.120
to be manipulated?

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.000
You went through all this trouble.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.320
What's your real aim?

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.640
Madam Su is ruthless and sinister.

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.160
She shows neither mercy nor loyalty.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.840
Yet you've served her faithfully
for years.

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.120
She must have dirt on you.

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:57.240
And you

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.360
must have kept an ace up your sleeve,

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.880
right?

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.120
Nonsense!

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.880
Madam Su's kindness to me is immense.

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:08.880
How could I betray her?

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.920
I'm the Prince Regent's favorite.

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:15.720
When His Highness rages,

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.400
many will die.

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.440
Madam Su and Shen Yuanjin

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:21.600
might survive his wrath.

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:23.760
But what about you?

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.080
Will you be killed by His Highness

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.360
or Madam Su?

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.040
I obstructed Shen Yuanjin.

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.920
Madam Su and I are locked
in mortal struggle.

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:42.960
We bear no grudge.

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.480
Give me Madam Su's secrets,

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.200
and I'll grant you 10,000 gold taels

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.440
to flee the capital forever.

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.240
Do I truly resemble

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.640
Shen Yuqing that much?

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:20.440
I killed Qin Xiaoniang

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.160
and captured her child.

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:28.840
If you were Shen Yuqing,

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.160
you wouldn't react like this.

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.080
What if...

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:39.880
Better to kill wrongly

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.520
than let escape.

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:47.680
This woman's cunning.

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.360
I nearly fell for her trap.

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:52.240
I am late.

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:53.520
I beg your punishment.

00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:59.760
Captured suffices.

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:00.880
You should leave.

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:04.120
My lady,

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.280
haven't I always handled disposals?

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:09.440
I'll handle

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:11.040
her remains personally.

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:13.360
Understood.

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:28.090
My lady.

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:29.248
She offered 10,000 gold taels

00:05:29.248 --> 00:05:30.200
to help Li Si escape.

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:31.280
Li Si hesitated

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:32.640
and whispered closely with her.

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:34.040
I couldn't overhear details.

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:37.520
Kill him.

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:39.120
Yes, My lady.

00:05:45.619 --> 00:05:47.740
(Yangque Garden)

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:49.720
This beast starved so fiercely.

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:52.200
It ruined pristine items

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.000
into this wretched state.

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:00.360
You dare hunger strike against me?

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:08.720
Tell me.

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:10.880
If treated likewise,

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:13.640
would humans react worse?

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.360
Beasts calm with food,

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:23.520
forgetting the past.

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:27.040
But humans deeply wronged

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:32.160
demand blood payment.

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:33.840
True.

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:35.400
People

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:37.400
outpace beasts in stubbornness.

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:39.720
Only death

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.160
brings peace.

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:47.200
Do you know?

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:49.600
Excessive killing

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:51.840
dooms one to the abyss.

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:58.560
No amount of sutras will save you.

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:06.520
My lady.

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:09.520
You're not afraid of the underworld.

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:13.880
Instead,

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:17.000
you fear vengeful spirits haunting you,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.000
seeking retribution.

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:22.360
Peel the skin off her bones!

00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:29.600
I'm Prince Regent's noble concubine.

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:31.360
Aren't you afraid
he will come after you?

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:38.000
Noble concubine?

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:41.880
Just a concubine who doesn't even dare
use her real name.

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:44.920
First, you substituted
in the bridal chamber.

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:47.440
Then, you hid your true identity.

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:50.000
You played with his feelings
again and again.

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:53.080
If he were here today,

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:55.040
you'd die even faster.

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:18.520
Your Highness.

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:21.440
The Duchess is determined
to kill Lady Xiyan.

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:23.744
I grew up in the Duke's Mansion,

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.600
where people devour others
without mercy.

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:26.560
Your Highness,

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:28.080
please save Lady Xiyan.

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:48.200
She foresaw this outcome.

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:49.720
Before leaving,

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:52.680
she asked me to deliver this letter

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:54.120
to you.

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:56.681
(Confession Edict)

00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:58.000
What?

00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:00.360
Not pleading for your mistress anymore?

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:03.880
Lady Xiyan had no one to rely on,

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:06.840
yet saved the life

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:08.360
of a stranger like me.

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:11.080
I'll go to the Duke's Mansion

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:13.040
to await her corpse.

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:15.400
After burying her properly,

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:17.960
I'll follow her in death.

00:09:28.032 --> 00:09:29.728
(Confession Edict)

00:09:34.272 --> 00:09:35.616
(Confession Edict)

00:09:40.448 --> 00:09:41.152
(Your Highness.)

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:56.440
(I have drifted through half a life.)

00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:58.600
(Only during my time at the mansion)

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:00.120
(did I find contentment.)

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:02.120
(Yet sadly,)

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:03.800
(the flower yearns for love,)

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:05.560
(but the stream remains cold.)

00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:07.800
(I could never win your heart.)

00:10:09.312 --> 00:10:11.100
(I still remember
our first meeting in Hexi.)

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:14.880
(A young general wore the black armor.)

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:16.880
Our first meeting in Hexi?

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:18.112
(His glance over shoulder)

00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:20.960
(etched itself forever in my memory.)

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:23.960
(In my heart,)

00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:26.560
(you will always be)

00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:29.600
(that cold-faced general
in splendid armor.)

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:42.840
My lady.

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:47.000
I'll serve her thoroughly.

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:53.920
End her breath

00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:56.400
until you pull out her hair.

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:13.480
Yuqing.

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:15.440
Both your intelligence

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:16.280
and beauty

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:18.280
surpass Jin's.

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:19.920
What a pity.

00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:21.400
You were born to the wrong womb.

00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:24.000
Had you come from my belly,

00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:25.720
you'd have achieved

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:27.680
more than Jin.

00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:30.040
If you must hate,

00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:31.760
hate your mother.

00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:36.480
After all, she is just
a lowly country medic.

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:41.000
(Pei Ji,)

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:43.720
(do you truly want me dead here?)

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:46.960
(No.)

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:49.160
(I haven't avenged my mother fully.)

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:51.400
(I can't die before seeing Zhao.)

00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:24.680
Your noble concubine Ye Xiyan
doesn't exist here.

00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:27.880
There's only Shen Yuqing,
the concubine-born daughter of the Duke.

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:29.440
Who is she?

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:31.200
I'll interrogate her myself.

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:33.120
Ji,

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:35.120
women can be replaced.

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:38.680
But ties with the Duke's Mansion
and the Empress Dowager

00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:40.360
would be irreversible.

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:01.160
The Prince Regent's household affairs

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:03.800
don't require your meddling.

00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:17.560
Open it!

00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:26.640
My cold-faced general,

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:30.120
you've come to save me at last.

00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:33.000
I want the truth.

00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:42.760
Ten years ago,

00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:46.440
bandits overran
multiple prefectures in Hexi.

00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:49.080
The imperial army crumbled.

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:51.400
The Ye family was slaughtered.

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:54.080
My mother hid me in a water vat,

00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:57.560
yet rebel soldiers still found me.

00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:00.240
As they pressed a blade to my throat,

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:02.840
flaming arrows

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:04.480
rained from the sky.

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:11.320
Appoint Prince Pei Ji
as fifth-rank Guerrilla General.

00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:12.920
He shall lead thirty thousand troops

00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:15.400
and quell the bandits in Hexi.

00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:18.480
In this famine year,
the Ministry of Revenue lacks supplies.

00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:19.840
The needed provisions

00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:20.840
shall be procured locally

00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:23.680
by the Prince.

00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:26.120
Your Majesty.

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:28.920
The Hexi bandits now number a million.

00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:30.760
Six prefectures have been ravaged,

00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:31.800
farmlands destroyed.

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:34.240
The Minister of War led
300,000 elites to resist,

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:35.280
yet got defeated.

00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:37.056
I won't cage myself

00:14:37.056 --> 00:14:38.258
or fight a battle I can't win.

00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:53.280
(Su Yinghua, The Empress Dowager)
These unruly rebels claim a million men.

00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:54.920
But they're just a disorganized mob.

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:57.440
The Minister of War fell
due to underestimation.

00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:00.000
I see you've made thorough preparations.

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:01.400
You will surely rid the court

00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:02.480
of this menace.

00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:04.040
Your Majesty, please...

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:06.480
The King of Wujiang
is willing to lend troops

00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:08.640
but with one condition.

00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:10.240
Your mother

00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:11.920
must serve him.

00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:15.800
Since you refuse to serve the nation,

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:18.600
then I have no choice...

00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:21.840
I'll do it as your command.

00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:33.800
You saved the people in Hexi

00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:36.200
and me.

00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:40.080
The Hexi folk call you

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:41.960
the cold-faced general.

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:44.880
Later at the orphanage,

00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:46.840
I suffered constant humiliation.

00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:50.360
Your wartime tales kept me going.

00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:53.320
They said

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:55.600
before battle,

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.120
your armor shone silver.

00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:00.680
But through bloodshed upon bloodshed,

00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:02.720
it turned black.

00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:09.000
Why it was three years ago exactly

00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:10.880
when Shen Yuqing vanished

00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:12.760
and you joined Meixiang House?

00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:16.000
Later still,

00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:21.760
the admired cold-faced general

00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:25.080
became the feared Prince Regent,

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:28.360
a ruthless killer.

00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:32.280
But I didn't believe it.

00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:34.480
I came alone to the capital

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:37.360
just to see you.

00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:40.880
Never expecting

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:43.080
to nearly lose my life.

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:54.640
Thankfully, Lady Qingmei saved me.

00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:58.760
But then I grew greedy.

00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:03.880
I thought

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:07.800
if I could be like Lady Qingmei,

00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:10.240
maybe you'd notice me

00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:12.800
and I'd become someone useful to you.

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:20.000
Your Highness,

00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:23.200
have you ever

00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:25.560
felt even a flutter of affection on me?
