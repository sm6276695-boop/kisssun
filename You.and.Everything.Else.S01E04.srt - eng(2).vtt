00:00:46.046 --> 00:00:49.966
YOU AND EVERYTHING ELSE

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.052
I'm telling you, she hit my palms.

00:00:52.635 --> 00:00:53.553
-Really?
-Yes!

00:00:53.636 --> 00:00:56.681
Yes. I hit her really hard.

00:00:57.182 --> 00:00:59.851
And you didn't even know it was me.

00:00:59.934 --> 00:01:02.270
But you got your revenge, didn't you?

00:01:02.771 --> 00:01:05.356
As for her, she always targeted me
during dodgeball.

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:08.610
Fess up.
You did that on purpose, didn't you?

00:01:09.444 --> 00:01:12.739
-Yeah. I think I did.
-Seriously?

00:01:14.991 --> 00:01:17.952
I still can't believe it.
What are the chances we'd meet here?

00:01:18.036 --> 00:01:18.953
I know, right?

00:01:19.454 --> 00:01:23.917
You should have told me earlier
that you had such a beautiful friend.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.126
Your phone's ringing.

00:01:26.586 --> 00:01:28.797
Stop avoiding your girlfriend's calls.

00:01:29.297 --> 00:01:30.882
-Excuse me.
-Yeah, go.

00:01:30.965 --> 00:01:32.842
Sorry, my phone was on silent. What's up?

00:01:32.926 --> 00:01:33.802
-Come here!
-Yeah.

00:01:35.512 --> 00:01:38.348
-See how I look out for you?
-Sure. It's nice to meet you.

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.894
We met at the booth. I'm Kim Sang-hak.
Business management. Class of 2000.

00:01:43.561 --> 00:01:44.395
I know.

00:01:45.271 --> 00:01:47.857
I'm Cheon Sang-yeon.
Engineering. Class of 2002.

00:01:49.734 --> 00:01:51.736
Whenever he would say his name,

00:01:52.237 --> 00:01:54.030
I felt conscious of Sang-yeon.

00:01:54.531 --> 00:01:59.077
But Sang-yeon didn't seem to care at all
about something as trivial as a name.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.872
Why didn't you stay in touch
if you were so close?

00:02:02.956 --> 00:02:05.083
Can't you find old friends
on I Love You School?

00:02:05.166 --> 00:02:06.084
You're right.

00:02:06.584 --> 00:02:09.921
I actually looked you up ages ago.
Didn't you look me up?

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:12.090
I didn't go on those sites.

00:02:12.173 --> 00:02:15.260
Really? Almost everyone has
a profile on I Love You School.

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.766
I never really loved school, you see.

00:02:23.101 --> 00:02:27.021
Also, I wasn't even in school back then.

00:02:27.105 --> 00:02:29.232
So you missed high school entirely?

00:02:29.315 --> 00:02:31.818
I attended for two months or so,
then quit.

00:02:33.194 --> 00:02:35.029
Wait, do you really have a Leica?

00:02:36.114 --> 00:02:37.282
It's my older brother's.

00:02:37.824 --> 00:02:39.075
Is he a photographer?

00:02:39.784 --> 00:02:41.244
As a hobby, I guess.

00:02:41.327 --> 00:02:43.454
How old is he? How can he afford a Leica?

00:02:43.538 --> 00:02:47.834
-I know.
-He's 4 years older than me, so he's 25.

00:02:47.917 --> 00:02:50.461
He just left the military,
so he's still in university.

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:53.882
What's his major?

00:02:54.924 --> 00:02:58.636
Guys, stop asking questions.
What is this, a hearing?

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.222
-Business management.
-No way. Me too!

00:03:01.306 --> 00:03:02.682
Sang-hak here too.

00:03:03.183 --> 00:03:04.934
What university is he at?

00:03:05.018 --> 00:03:06.102
Seoul University.

00:03:08.188 --> 00:03:12.442
Sang-yeon spoke of her brother
with such ease.

00:03:12.942 --> 00:03:17.155
As though Sang-hak were really alive
and well somewhere.

00:03:17.238 --> 00:03:19.699
Eun-jung, have you met her older brother?

00:03:19.782 --> 00:03:20.909
Is he handsome?

00:03:22.202 --> 00:03:24.204
What? Yeah, I've seen him.

00:03:24.704 --> 00:03:26.789
He's handsome. Really handsome.

00:03:26.873 --> 00:03:30.835
Who's more handsome?
Sang-hak oppa here or Sang-yeon's oppa?

00:03:33.463 --> 00:03:35.465
Kim Sang-hak seonbae is far more handsome.

00:03:35.548 --> 00:03:37.634
Jeez, come on.

00:03:37.717 --> 00:03:40.386
I told you to stop bringing up my looks.

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.472
People will think
that's all I have to offer.

00:03:42.555 --> 00:03:46.017
Come on, put him in his place.
Your boyfriend's getting cocky again.

00:03:46.851 --> 00:03:51.606
Okay. Well, your facial features
are well-proportioned,

00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:53.650
but you're not that good-looking.

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.111
Okay, duly noted. I get it.

00:03:57.195 --> 00:03:58.863
God, you're so funny.

00:03:59.447 --> 00:04:01.407
These two are dating, by the way.

00:04:02.533 --> 00:04:05.703
Wow, really? You guys look good together.

00:04:05.787 --> 00:04:07.038
-Do we?
-Yeah.

00:04:07.121 --> 00:04:08.206
That hurt my pride.

00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:10.375
Honestly, you're not that handsome.

00:04:11.834 --> 00:04:14.837
Brilliant. So funny.

00:04:17.131 --> 00:04:18.883
Where do you have to be this late?

00:04:18.967 --> 00:04:20.176
I have a part-time job.

00:04:20.677 --> 00:04:23.054
No one could cover her shift.
How will you get there?

00:04:23.137 --> 00:04:24.847
-Subway.
-I'm taking the subway too.

00:04:24.931 --> 00:04:26.724
-Goodbye, then.
-Bye, guys.

00:04:26.808 --> 00:04:29.686
Dae-kyu, didn't you say
you'd stay for round three?

00:04:29.769 --> 00:04:31.688
-Bye, guys.
-Bye!

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:34.232
Let's go for another round!

00:04:34.899 --> 00:04:37.026
-Are you that happy?
-Yeah.

00:04:38.152 --> 00:04:42.240
But it all feels like a blur.
Maybe because I still can't believe it.

00:04:43.241 --> 00:04:46.202
I think we'll have a lot to talk about
when I see her tomorrow.

00:04:46.286 --> 00:04:50.498
Do you remember that photo
from one of your old exhibitions?

00:04:50.581 --> 00:04:53.418
I thought it was Sang-yeon in that photo.

00:04:53.501 --> 00:04:54.669
-Really?
-Yeah.

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:56.796
Hold up.

00:04:59.299 --> 00:05:00.842
Jeez, Ryu Eun-jung.

00:05:00.925 --> 00:05:04.929
Why didn't you ever mention her to me
if you were so close with her?

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:09.600
Didn't I? I can't really remember.

00:05:09.684 --> 00:05:11.311
You can't really remember?

00:05:12.228 --> 00:05:16.691
You always spoke of Na-mi and Ju-eun,
but I never heard about Cheon Sang-yeon.

00:05:18.401 --> 00:05:19.527
Oh, I don't know.

00:05:21.154 --> 00:05:24.115
It's all so complicated.
I'll tell you next time.

00:05:25.116 --> 00:05:26.326
Will you actually?

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:28.286
Of course I will.

00:05:28.369 --> 00:05:33.958
Because I can't talk about my life
without mentioning Cheon Sang-yeon.

00:05:41.007 --> 00:05:45.011
And going forward, you won't be able to
discuss your life without mentioning me.

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:51.642
That's true even now.

00:05:52.143 --> 00:05:56.939
Even now, I can't talk about my life
without mentioning you, silly.

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:58.399
"Silly"?

00:05:58.483 --> 00:05:59.567
Yes, "silly."

00:06:00.318 --> 00:06:03.404
I bet you didn't know
that's what I call you in my diary.

00:06:03.488 --> 00:06:04.322
-You do?
-Yeah.

00:06:04.405 --> 00:06:07.116
Come here. Bring it on, you.

00:06:10.912 --> 00:06:11.788
Sang-yeon!

00:06:12.538 --> 00:06:13.373
Hey.

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.221
She resigned from school?

00:06:29.013 --> 00:06:32.100
Yeah. Complaints from parents
were pouring in.

00:06:35.353 --> 00:06:36.604
Complaints?

00:06:41.109 --> 00:06:44.695
I guess she was a homeroom teacher
who didn't care about her students.

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:53.329
Ms. Yoon didn't care about her students?

00:06:56.791 --> 00:06:59.085
She's not the Ms. Yoon you remember.

00:07:04.465 --> 00:07:05.383
Really?

00:07:05.466 --> 00:07:07.051
You know we went bankrupt, right?

00:07:07.552 --> 00:07:08.386
What?

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:10.054
Yeah.

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:15.268
What about you? Where do you live?

00:07:17.937 --> 00:07:21.566
I still live in the same neighborhood.
We moved to a different house though.

00:07:22.191 --> 00:07:25.027
It's two streets over from my old house.

00:07:26.529 --> 00:07:28.406
My mom runs a rice cake shop.

00:07:29.282 --> 00:07:31.993
Remember Daeseong's Mill
in your old apartment complex?

00:07:33.244 --> 00:07:34.245
Yeah.

00:07:34.871 --> 00:07:36.164
She runs it with my uncle.

00:07:36.247 --> 00:07:39.083
Right, I see.

00:07:39.584 --> 00:07:41.711
My mom and dad got divorced.

00:07:42.753 --> 00:07:45.840
After the divorce,
Mom and I moved to Gangneung.

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:54.474
And your dad still lives in Seoul?

00:07:56.642 --> 00:07:59.061
I don't know. We don't stay in touch.

00:08:01.022 --> 00:08:01.939
I see.

00:08:05.526 --> 00:08:11.073
I thought we'd have so much to say,
but I was flustered by how awkward it was.

00:08:14.785 --> 00:08:19.457
Perhaps those five years
had taken something away from us.

00:08:22.877 --> 00:08:23.961
See you around.

00:08:24.045 --> 00:08:25.963
Yeah. Good luck with that paper.

00:08:30.176 --> 00:08:31.177
Sang-yeon?

00:08:40.102 --> 00:08:41.062
Can I ask…

00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:47.026
why you didn't tell me
you were moving back then?

00:08:49.779 --> 00:08:51.822
Were you upset with me or something?

00:08:54.617 --> 00:08:56.953
No. Why?

00:08:59.205 --> 00:09:02.750
Ju-eun called me to say
it looked like your family was moving,

00:09:02.833 --> 00:09:06.671
so I rushed over to your place,
but you had already left.

00:09:07.755 --> 00:09:09.507
I paged you, but you never replied.

00:09:10.299 --> 00:09:12.468
You even changed your pager number.

00:09:15.972 --> 00:09:18.140
I told you that we went bankrupt.

00:09:18.975 --> 00:09:22.603
How could I contact you
when we were practically running away?

00:09:24.814 --> 00:09:30.236
Still, I thought that if I waited,
I'd hear from you. But I never did.

00:09:34.532 --> 00:09:39.662
Dad told me not to contact anyone
and got rid of my pager.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.042
I see.

00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:53.467
So you weren't mad at me or something?

00:09:55.303 --> 00:09:56.345
Of course not.

00:09:57.638 --> 00:09:59.390
I'm happy to see you again.

00:10:00.516 --> 00:10:01.350
I mean it.

00:10:03.561 --> 00:10:04.729
I am too.

00:10:07.023 --> 00:10:11.193
My mom's even more excited than I am.
She keeps asking when you’ll come visit.

00:10:11.694 --> 00:10:12.528
Really?

00:10:13.571 --> 00:10:15.656
I'd love to see her too.

00:10:17.158 --> 00:10:19.994
Tell her I’ll come visit
as soon as I get a day off work.

00:10:20.578 --> 00:10:22.330
Sure. Mom would love that.

00:10:23.581 --> 00:10:24.582
I'll see you later.

00:10:24.665 --> 00:10:25.541
See you.

00:10:36.761 --> 00:10:39.138
Where is your friend Cheon Sang-yeon?

00:10:39.639 --> 00:10:41.182
She's working.

00:10:41.265 --> 00:10:44.101
Gosh, she sure has a lot on her plate.

00:10:44.602 --> 00:10:46.937
Does she even have time
for club activities?

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:48.397
Who knows?

00:10:50.941 --> 00:10:52.485
Hurry. The food's delicious.

00:10:53.444 --> 00:10:56.280
I'll take that. Thank you.

00:11:06.957 --> 00:11:08.542
Do you cook at home?

00:11:08.626 --> 00:11:11.295
Yeah. I cook at least one meal a day.

00:11:11.962 --> 00:11:15.633
It's usually just putting rice
in the cooker. I keep it simple.

00:11:15.716 --> 00:11:18.260
It's good you eat
at least one meal at home.

00:11:18.344 --> 00:11:21.931
I tried to stop Mom
in case you might not eat at home.

00:11:22.014 --> 00:11:25.768
She insisted her anchovies aren't salty
and you could eat them without rice.

00:11:27.103 --> 00:11:29.313
I do love your mom's cooking.

00:11:29.814 --> 00:11:33.776
But tell her not to cook for me next time.

00:11:33.859 --> 00:11:36.153
My fridge is tiny,
so I don't have much space.

00:11:36.237 --> 00:11:37.988
I already told her not to.

00:11:39.156 --> 00:11:40.991
Let's stop to use the toilet.

00:11:41.784 --> 00:11:42.827
Okay, go ahead.

00:11:43.536 --> 00:11:44.870
You should come too.

00:11:45.996 --> 00:11:46.956
I don't need to go.

00:11:47.039 --> 00:11:48.582
Come with me anyway.

00:11:49.375 --> 00:11:51.168
I really don't need to go.

00:11:52.336 --> 00:11:54.839
I don't have a toilet at home, that's why.

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:57.258
You don't have a toilet?

00:11:58.718 --> 00:12:01.137
There is one, but it's a squat toilet.

00:12:08.018 --> 00:12:09.145
-Careful.
-Okay.

00:12:12.231 --> 00:12:13.441
That's the toilet.

00:12:21.198 --> 00:12:23.284
I can take back anything you don't want.

00:12:23.367 --> 00:12:24.577
I'm going to eat it all.

00:12:25.745 --> 00:12:26.746
I'm almost done.

00:12:27.997 --> 00:12:29.081
Take your time.

00:12:42.344 --> 00:12:46.265
I couldn't quite believe

00:12:47.433 --> 00:12:49.101
that this was Sang-yeon's room.

00:12:57.193 --> 00:12:59.403
Hey, this is really good.

00:13:00.279 --> 00:13:01.322
Try some.

00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:06.619
-Good, right?
-They're okay.

00:13:10.873 --> 00:13:13.042
Oh, those. The hinge broke.

00:13:13.709 --> 00:13:14.627
I can see that.

00:13:15.544 --> 00:13:16.545
It's all right.

00:13:16.629 --> 00:13:20.299
It's payday today, so I'll buy a new pair
first thing tomorrow.

00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:28.849
Other than the toilet issue,
this place is decent.

00:13:28.933 --> 00:13:30.935
The rent's affordable too. 80,000 won.

00:13:32.061 --> 00:13:33.354
That is affordable.

00:13:35.105 --> 00:13:35.940
This is so good.

00:13:37.191 --> 00:13:40.277
Are you sure it's okay to drink
before your shift?

00:13:40.778 --> 00:13:41.779
It's just a beer.

00:13:43.072 --> 00:13:45.491
I don't have to be there until 9:00,
so it's fine.

00:13:46.450 --> 00:13:49.620
Work won't be a problem,
but going to the toilet will be.

00:13:49.703 --> 00:13:51.247
I'm fine using that toilet.

00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:53.999
We had a squat toilet until fourth grade.

00:13:54.583 --> 00:13:56.126
-Really?
-Yeah.

00:13:58.170 --> 00:14:03.634
I always thought that squat toilets
only existed in places like folk villages.

00:14:05.886 --> 00:14:11.100
I am a little shocked that there's still
a squat toilet here in Seoul in 2002.

00:14:11.809 --> 00:14:16.063
That's why I don't eat after 7 p.m.
To avoid using the toilet.

00:14:16.981 --> 00:14:20.109
The toilets we went to earlier
close at 10:00 p.m.

00:14:20.693 --> 00:14:23.237
You know what was
a real culture shock for me?

00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:25.990
Seeing two bathrooms in your old house.

00:14:28.158 --> 00:14:31.745
Maybe I have zero bathrooms now
because I had two back then.

00:14:35.624 --> 00:14:36.500
The thing is,

00:14:37.376 --> 00:14:40.671
I didn't even know my family was poor
until fourth grade.

00:14:41.547 --> 00:14:46.302
It only hit me after the city developments
and our move to a semi-basement.

00:14:49.722 --> 00:14:52.641
I really liked your old house.

00:14:53.726 --> 00:14:54.768
Don't be ridiculous.

00:14:55.436 --> 00:14:57.146
You said I was the first.

00:14:59.607 --> 00:15:01.567
I was the only one you invited.

00:15:04.028 --> 00:15:05.362
That's why you liked it?

00:15:06.322 --> 00:15:07.156
Yeah.

00:15:07.239 --> 00:15:08.657
How silly.

00:15:09.867 --> 00:15:11.160
Anyway,

00:15:12.578 --> 00:15:15.331
I think being poor is all relative.

00:15:16.457 --> 00:15:18.125
I think it's absolute.

00:15:21.629 --> 00:15:24.882
If you have no money,
there's nothing you can do.

00:15:25.507 --> 00:15:26.967
Absolutely nothing.

00:15:28.594 --> 00:15:30.596
The world is a place

00:15:31.513 --> 00:15:35.601
that offers even less
to those who are most desperate.

00:15:37.353 --> 00:15:41.815
Think about it. I had two bathrooms
when I didn't even need them,

00:15:41.899 --> 00:15:43.192
but now I have none.

00:15:43.275 --> 00:15:47.029
And now I'm at a good university,
but I can't find students to tutor.

00:15:50.699 --> 00:15:52.242
You'll find students.

00:15:53.202 --> 00:15:54.411
I do hope so.

00:16:01.293 --> 00:16:05.297
How could you drink so much
with someone who has to go to work?

00:16:05.381 --> 00:16:08.425
She only had one beer.
I ended up having three beers, maybe?

00:16:08.509 --> 00:16:10.135
That's a lie. I had four.

00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:14.515
Seems like you had fun though.

00:16:15.099 --> 00:16:16.392
Yeah, it was fun.

00:16:19.186 --> 00:16:22.731
But the alcohol was…
Maybe because it all felt a little bleak…

00:16:22.815 --> 00:16:23.857
Bleak? Why?

00:16:27.194 --> 00:16:28.487
Sang-yeon, she…

00:16:34.076 --> 00:16:36.870
Never mind.
I think I'll cry if I talk about it.

00:16:36.954 --> 00:16:38.831
What's new? You always cry.

00:16:38.914 --> 00:16:42.543
Exactly. I absolutely hate crying
while talking,

00:16:43.043 --> 00:16:44.753
but I just can't stop myself.

00:16:45.546 --> 00:16:46.672
So I'd rather not say.

00:16:48.966 --> 00:16:50.134
You'll blab eventually.

00:16:51.093 --> 00:16:52.219
I so won't.

00:16:53.595 --> 00:16:55.389
It all looked a little lonely.

00:16:56.098 --> 00:16:57.391
Sang-yeon

00:16:58.892 --> 00:17:00.394
and her place.

00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:08.318
I'm not going to cry.

00:17:08.402 --> 00:17:10.654
You think I'm a big crybaby, don't you?

00:17:11.155 --> 00:17:12.865
Yikes, you're sensitive.

00:17:12.948 --> 00:17:14.992
Look. No tears, right?

00:17:15.075 --> 00:17:16.577
Why, I'm so proud of you.

00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:19.621
Sang-yeon says she likes your photo.

00:17:20.456 --> 00:17:21.582
-My photo?
-Yes.

00:17:21.665 --> 00:17:22.624
She's seen my photos?

00:17:22.708 --> 00:17:25.502
She must have gone to the clubroom
during some free time.

00:17:25.586 --> 00:17:28.547
She asked who took the photo of the chair
that was on the wall.

00:17:29.965 --> 00:17:32.843
She must have an eye for photography.

00:17:32.926 --> 00:17:33.802
I agree.

00:17:34.303 --> 00:17:36.305
Don't you have some prints of that?

00:17:36.388 --> 00:17:37.473
Yeah, I do.

00:17:37.556 --> 00:17:38.682
Let's give her one.

00:17:39.641 --> 00:17:40.476
Okay, sure.

00:17:41.685 --> 00:17:43.353
And she's coming to the seminar.

00:17:43.937 --> 00:17:47.274
-The seminar?
-I bragged about you presenting.

00:17:47.357 --> 00:17:50.486
If she comes to anything,
she should come on a photography trip.

00:17:50.569 --> 00:17:54.448
No. You're most admirable
when you're leading your seminars.

00:17:57.576 --> 00:17:59.828
Do you want her to admire me?

00:18:01.038 --> 00:18:02.081
Of course.

00:18:02.581 --> 00:18:06.710
Boy, I do hope she doesn't
complicate things by falling for me.

00:18:10.255 --> 00:18:11.632
Don't worry. She won't.

00:18:13.008 --> 00:18:14.009
She won't?

00:18:14.093 --> 00:18:16.261
Yes. She would never.

00:18:16.887 --> 00:18:19.890
Excuse me? I feel strangely offended.
Why wouldn't she?

00:18:19.973 --> 00:18:21.308
She has high standards.

00:18:21.391 --> 00:18:22.392
Hey!

00:18:23.102 --> 00:18:24.812
I'm just saying she'll be there.

00:18:25.312 --> 00:18:27.606
So make sure to do your best.

00:18:29.274 --> 00:18:30.818
Okay, I'll do my best.

00:18:30.901 --> 00:18:34.488
I understand that we cannot verify
the photo's authenticity

00:18:34.571 --> 00:18:38.951
because the photographer,
as well as the witnesses,

00:18:39.034 --> 00:18:40.452
gave inconsistent testimonies.

00:18:40.536 --> 00:18:44.456
But what does that have to do
with the photographer's integrity?

00:18:46.291 --> 00:18:47.918
It has everything to do with it.

00:18:48.919 --> 00:18:53.006
If a photo's authenticity is questionable,
of course, it's a matter of integrity.

00:18:53.090 --> 00:18:55.134
Why is this even a question?

00:18:55.217 --> 00:18:59.054
Okay. Let's say a moment of greed
led to a manipulated photo,

00:18:59.138 --> 00:19:02.558
or they accepted
the editor's manipulation of the photo.

00:19:02.641 --> 00:19:06.645
Regardless, the photographer is
responsible for any deceptive photos.

00:19:07.146 --> 00:19:09.773
No excuses. How can you deny that?

00:19:10.524 --> 00:19:12.860
I don't mean to deny that.

00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:15.988
The point I'm trying to make here is…

00:19:17.614 --> 00:19:21.160
To be honest, the reason I find
your presentation mind-numbingly dull

00:19:22.244 --> 00:19:26.832
is that from the start, you've portrayed
the photographer in a negative light.

00:19:26.915 --> 00:19:28.000
It's irrational.

00:19:28.083 --> 00:19:29.418
Dude, this is crazy.

00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:32.379
I'm irrational?

00:19:35.465 --> 00:19:39.261
Do you really think that artists
can be separated from their art?

00:19:39.344 --> 00:19:41.180
He'd already been outsmarted,

00:19:41.263 --> 00:19:43.682
but I still hoped
he'd turn it around using reason.

00:19:43.765 --> 00:19:46.977
We're talking about war photography here.
It's documentary work.

00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:49.521
People have already accepted
these photos as truth.

00:19:50.022 --> 00:19:52.900
Now, that's completely off the mark.

00:19:53.609 --> 00:19:56.987
How am I off the mark?
This was the point from the beginning.

00:19:57.070 --> 00:19:58.614
How is that even relevant?

00:19:59.448 --> 00:20:00.324
Defeated.

00:20:04.161 --> 00:20:06.205
Did she come here to pick a fight?

00:20:06.288 --> 00:20:09.291
She never shows up for club activities,
then comes to pick a fight?

00:20:09.374 --> 00:20:10.959
She wasn't picking a fight.

00:20:12.878 --> 00:20:14.087
Gosh, my head hurts.

00:20:16.506 --> 00:20:17.591
How embarrassing.

00:20:19.801 --> 00:20:21.428
Who do you think was right?

00:20:23.055 --> 00:20:27.100
You can do better next time.
Don't think about it too much.

00:20:28.727 --> 00:20:30.479
So you agree with her, then?

00:20:32.648 --> 00:20:34.024
She totally crushed me.

00:20:35.192 --> 00:20:36.360
You had fun?

00:20:36.443 --> 00:20:38.445
Yeah. How should I put it?

00:20:38.528 --> 00:20:41.823
It felt like I was finally
a true university student.

00:20:43.116 --> 00:20:45.327
Your boyfriend's presentation
was so interesting.

00:20:46.495 --> 00:20:47.496
Seriously?

00:20:48.247 --> 00:20:51.541
-Didn't you find it interesting?
-It was interesting, all right.

00:20:53.335 --> 00:20:54.836
Did I act like a snob again?

00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:56.213
Yeah.

00:20:56.922 --> 00:20:59.675
Goodness! When did you become so pretty?

00:20:59.758 --> 00:21:01.927
-Have you been well, Mrs. Jang?
-Of course.

00:21:02.010 --> 00:21:03.679
You look so beautiful.

00:21:04.513 --> 00:21:06.223
So will you take the tutoring job?

00:21:06.306 --> 00:21:08.392
Yes. Thank you for the recommendation.

00:21:08.475 --> 00:21:10.769
Oh, don't mention it.
I didn't do anything.

00:21:10.852 --> 00:21:14.189
The piano academy owner upstairs
needed a tutor for her kids,

00:21:14.273 --> 00:21:15.190
so I mentioned you.

00:21:17.317 --> 00:21:18.610
Are they in high school?

00:21:18.694 --> 00:21:20.487
Yes, her daughter is.

00:21:20.570 --> 00:21:23.282
Her son's in middle school,
and he'll be bringing a friend.

00:21:23.365 --> 00:21:26.034
Wow, I didn't know it would be three kids!

00:21:27.536 --> 00:21:28.370
-Seonbae.
-Hello.

00:21:28.453 --> 00:21:29.538
Welcome, Sang-hak.

00:21:31.248 --> 00:21:32.207
Hello.

00:21:32.291 --> 00:21:34.793
Yeah, hi. Long time no see.

00:21:37.963 --> 00:21:41.049
I'm so excited that the three of us
are drinking together.

00:21:48.807 --> 00:21:51.310
Hold up. Are you feeling shy?

00:21:51.977 --> 00:21:52.936
As if.

00:21:56.106 --> 00:21:57.441
You so are!

00:21:59.067 --> 00:22:01.403
No way. Is this because of the seminar?

00:22:01.486 --> 00:22:02.362
Hey.

00:22:04.448 --> 00:22:07.367
Don't talk about the seminar.
The topic is off-limits.

00:22:09.411 --> 00:22:12.706
Sang-yeon said
she found your presentation interesting.

00:22:13.415 --> 00:22:14.458
Isn't that right?

00:22:15.042 --> 00:22:15.876
Yes.

00:22:17.502 --> 00:22:20.005
It was interesting, actually.

00:22:20.589 --> 00:22:25.844
Interesting or not, the point is
that the photo was manipulated.

00:22:26.345 --> 00:22:28.096
I never said that it wasn't.

00:22:29.973 --> 00:22:31.475
If you agree, then why did you--

00:22:31.558 --> 00:22:32.768
That's enough.

00:22:32.851 --> 00:22:35.771
I have to agree with Sang-yeon
about the seminar.

00:22:35.854 --> 00:22:37.105
Let's change the subject.

00:22:37.189 --> 00:22:38.315
Come on. Cheers.

00:22:40.150 --> 00:22:41.193
Cheers.

00:22:45.155 --> 00:22:49.785
By the way,
didn't you bring that photo that day?

00:22:54.623 --> 00:22:58.418
You did, didn't you?
You brought it, right?

00:22:58.502 --> 00:22:59.628
No comment.

00:23:01.004 --> 00:23:02.005
What?

00:23:02.089 --> 00:23:04.383
The chair photo that you said you liked.

00:23:04.966 --> 00:23:09.221
My boyfriend brought that photo for you,
but you put him through that ordeal.

00:23:10.263 --> 00:23:13.809
"The reason I find your presentation
mind-numbingly dull is…"

00:23:15.018 --> 00:23:18.397
Oh dear. God, I'm so sorry.

00:23:19.272 --> 00:23:22.359
Could I have that photo, please?

00:23:23.610 --> 00:23:24.528
It depends.

00:23:24.611 --> 00:23:27.114
I'll do my best. Please?

00:23:27.197 --> 00:23:28.949
I'll be watching you closely.

00:23:29.032 --> 00:23:29.950
Okay.

00:23:30.033 --> 00:23:31.410
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

00:24:07.404 --> 00:24:11.825
Once Sang-yeon started tutoring,
we began to hang out almost every day.

00:24:15.036 --> 00:24:16.788
-One, two, three.
-Let's do this!

00:24:16.872 --> 00:24:18.165
Let's go!

00:24:21.334 --> 00:24:22.461
Hurry up! Come on!

00:24:22.544 --> 00:24:23.795
Pass it to me!

00:24:23.879 --> 00:24:25.422
Nice shot!

00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:32.429
Hey, it's fine.

00:24:32.512 --> 00:24:35.182
I'll switch. Switch with me. You're in.

00:24:36.141 --> 00:24:37.267
Good luck!

00:24:37.350 --> 00:24:38.810
-Go.
-Hello, oppa.

00:24:38.894 --> 00:24:39.769
Hey.

00:24:43.565 --> 00:24:47.611
Hey. Why do you call everyone else "oppa"
but your boyfriend "seonbae"?

00:24:50.614 --> 00:24:54.367
Since orientation, I've called
the upperclassmen in my major "oppa,"

00:24:54.451 --> 00:24:58.038
whereas I've called Sang-hak "seonbae"
since I first signed up for the club.

00:24:58.121 --> 00:24:59.748
Yeah, but why?

00:24:59.831 --> 00:25:03.210
You're the only girl in our year
who calls him "seonbae."

00:25:03.293 --> 00:25:04.711
Everyone calls him "oppa."

00:25:05.879 --> 00:25:07.339
That's because…

00:25:10.342 --> 00:25:15.680
I could never bring myself
to call him "Sang-hak oppa."

00:25:17.891 --> 00:25:21.019
Doesn't it sound kind of cool?
"Seonbae. Sang-hak seonbae."

00:25:21.811 --> 00:25:24.981
But still, calling your boyfriend
"seonbae" is a bit…

00:25:27.526 --> 00:25:29.486
She calls him "seonbae" too, you know.

00:25:29.986 --> 00:25:32.280
Is it some weird custom
from your hometown?

00:25:35.575 --> 00:25:38.995
I bet her reasons for calling him that
are similar to mine.

00:25:40.163 --> 00:25:43.542
By the way, how come she never dates?

00:25:44.167 --> 00:25:45.627
She isn't seeing anyone, is she?

00:25:46.503 --> 00:25:47.379
I'm not sure.

00:25:47.879 --> 00:25:51.591
Do you know why Byeong-gi and Dae-kyu
are nowhere to be seen these days?

00:25:52.175 --> 00:25:54.219
They asked her out,
but she flat-out refused.

00:25:54.886 --> 00:25:56.304
Byeong-gi liked Sang-yeon too?

00:25:56.388 --> 00:25:58.014
I doubt he's the only one.

00:25:58.098 --> 00:26:01.476
I'm pretty sure everyone from her cohort
is interested in her.

00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:05.105
I'm not surprised.
She's always been popular.

00:26:05.188 --> 00:26:07.482
I wonder if she really
isn't interested in anyone.

00:26:12.112 --> 00:26:13.655
Do you think

00:26:14.614 --> 00:26:18.660
there's anyone in our photography club
that Sang-yeon might like?

00:26:23.373 --> 00:26:24.207
Kim Sang-hak?

00:26:25.292 --> 00:26:26.126
What?

00:26:26.626 --> 00:26:29.087
What do you mean, "What?"

00:26:29.170 --> 00:26:32.757
You asked whether there was anyone
she might like, and I think there is.

00:26:33.425 --> 00:26:35.802
This isn't about
whether they'll go out or not.

00:26:35.885 --> 00:26:37.137
There's just

00:26:38.430 --> 00:26:40.098
a vibe, you know?

00:26:51.234 --> 00:26:52.944
Then do you think Sang-hak seonbae…

00:26:54.863 --> 00:26:55.697
Forget it.

00:26:57.282 --> 00:27:01.286
I knew you'd react like this.
Be honest. You're curious, aren't you?

00:27:01.369 --> 00:27:05.081
About whether he's even
the slightest bit interested in her.

00:27:06.499 --> 00:27:09.961
Not at all! You're so mean.

00:27:10.462 --> 00:27:11.379
I'm right, aren't I?

00:27:11.963 --> 00:27:14.090
Did you miss it?
They actually scored a goal.

00:27:14.174 --> 00:27:18.136
Stop lying, man. Who would have known
that Lee Chun-soo would deliver?

00:27:18.219 --> 00:27:19.220
Right?

00:27:19.304 --> 00:27:21.264
Why? Did Lee Chun-soo score?

00:27:21.348 --> 00:27:24.893
Yeah. He got past the defense
and the goalie in the penalty area.

00:27:24.976 --> 00:27:25.852
Really?

00:27:26.728 --> 00:27:28.480
What if we get to the final 16?

00:27:28.563 --> 00:27:32.859
Fat chance. In terms of physicality,
the opponents are on a different level.

00:27:32.942 --> 00:27:34.861
…he gets in the car after their fight.

00:27:34.944 --> 00:27:38.531
Yeah, and he comes back later.
But Arnie disappears, causing chaos.

00:27:38.615 --> 00:27:40.116
-Right.
-I swear DiCaprio is…

00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:43.411
Sang-hak and Sang-yeon
clicked in many ways.

00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:45.622
Especially regarding movies.

00:27:46.790 --> 00:27:49.626
Why would you talk about movies
in a photography club?

00:27:50.543 --> 00:27:52.754
They should have joined
a movie club instead.

00:27:55.298 --> 00:27:57.884
Ta-da. I bought us all ice cream.

00:27:57.967 --> 00:27:59.260
-Nice.
-How much?

00:27:59.344 --> 00:28:02.138
-10,000 won bet.
-10,000? Okay, you're on.

00:28:02.222 --> 00:28:03.765
-Did you buy vanilla?
-Of course!

00:28:03.848 --> 00:28:06.226
Hey, save the chocolate-coated one
for Eun-jung.

00:28:06.309 --> 00:28:07.185
I want vanilla!

00:28:07.268 --> 00:28:09.312
Guys, what should you say?

00:28:09.396 --> 00:28:11.481
-Thank you.
-That's more like it.

00:28:11.564 --> 00:28:13.692
-Vanilla, yum.
-Thank you!

00:28:13.775 --> 00:28:15.694
-Thank you.
-You're on.

00:28:15.777 --> 00:28:18.071
Eat this. Just take what you're given.

00:28:25.537 --> 00:28:27.706
Why don't you date?

00:28:28.206 --> 00:28:30.625
-What?
-Does nobody strike your fancy?

00:28:31.751 --> 00:28:33.294
I do have a crush.

00:28:35.422 --> 00:28:36.506
You do?

00:28:36.589 --> 00:28:37.424
Yeah.

00:28:38.133 --> 00:28:39.008
Who is it?

00:28:40.427 --> 00:28:41.594
Well,

00:28:42.137 --> 00:28:46.307
someone I met in an online chat room
while I was in Gangneung.

00:28:48.518 --> 00:28:49.644
"Online chat room"?

00:28:50.812 --> 00:28:54.566
If you were in Gangneung, that was
ages ago. Why aren't you dating him?

00:28:55.567 --> 00:28:57.235
You can't date all of your crushes.

00:28:58.278 --> 00:29:02.282
If it's you, then yeah.
Who would pass you up?

00:29:03.950 --> 00:29:05.118
It wasn't mutual.

00:29:06.911 --> 00:29:08.413
Man, I'm annoyed.

00:29:09.456 --> 00:29:10.999
It was an unrequited crush.

00:29:11.624 --> 00:29:12.751
"Unrequited crush"?

00:29:14.335 --> 00:29:15.920
Do you know what he looks like?

00:29:16.588 --> 00:29:17.422
Yes.

00:29:18.882 --> 00:29:20.008
I followed him around.

00:29:21.176 --> 00:29:22.177
Followed him around?

00:29:22.677 --> 00:29:23.511
Secretly.

00:29:24.137 --> 00:29:24.971
I stalked him.

00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:30.351
Why? You should have
confessed your feelings.

00:29:32.937 --> 00:29:34.314
He has a girlfriend.

00:29:36.316 --> 00:29:39.319
Oh… That's too bad.

00:29:41.196 --> 00:29:42.655
What kind of person is he?

00:29:44.073 --> 00:29:45.283
Is he handsome?

00:29:54.959 --> 00:29:58.463
He got me to fall for him,
so I guess he wasn't ugly.

00:30:01.925 --> 00:30:06.471
I'm really curious about
what kind of person you would be drawn to.

00:30:06.971 --> 00:30:08.056
It's all in the past now.

00:30:09.265 --> 00:30:11.851
I'm going to find someone new.

00:30:13.269 --> 00:30:15.730
Okay. Keep your eyes peeled.

00:30:17.649 --> 00:30:18.483
For what?

00:30:19.192 --> 00:30:20.193
It's nothing.

00:30:35.416 --> 00:30:36.668
STORIES ON MOVIES

00:30:56.187 --> 00:30:58.147
-You're reading about movies?
-Holy crap!

00:31:00.817 --> 00:31:02.569
God, you scared me.

00:31:04.237 --> 00:31:05.947
Why were you so surprised?

00:31:06.030 --> 00:31:08.116
-When did you get here?
-Last night.

00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:10.869
-What?
-I developed almost a hundred photos.

00:31:10.952 --> 00:31:11.786
Want to see?

00:31:13.538 --> 00:31:17.166
It's such a delicate process,
so I kept getting different results.

00:31:17.250 --> 00:31:18.668
It was driving me nuts.

00:31:18.751 --> 00:31:20.545
Then it suddenly clicked.

00:31:21.379 --> 00:31:22.297
Look there.

00:31:24.591 --> 00:31:26.175
Those ones made the cut.

00:31:26.718 --> 00:31:28.052
Which one is the best?

00:31:29.721 --> 00:31:34.350
Oh, well, they all look similar to me.

00:31:35.310 --> 00:31:36.144
They do?

00:31:37.854 --> 00:31:39.397
I can't seem to pick one.

00:31:43.276 --> 00:31:45.403
You developed this one photo all night?

00:31:45.486 --> 00:31:48.781
Yeah. Developing photos is so much fun.

00:31:58.374 --> 00:32:00.960
I could never beat her.

00:32:01.044 --> 00:32:03.087
These photos turned out really well.

00:32:03.838 --> 00:32:06.007
Each one is great in its own unique way.

00:32:06.633 --> 00:32:08.217
Maybe it's the camera.

00:32:08.718 --> 00:32:11.137
Cameras don't take photos by themselves.

00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:14.140
I couldn't pick the best one out of these.

00:32:14.223 --> 00:32:16.809
Whoa, you did a great job
developing these.

00:32:17.393 --> 00:32:20.647
All three are unique,
but each one has a vibrant color gradient.

00:32:20.730 --> 00:32:21.981
Which one do you guys like?

00:32:22.065 --> 00:32:24.734
-Let's show this in our August exhibit.
-This one?

00:32:24.817 --> 00:32:27.487
All the emotions I'd forgotten
came flooding back.

00:32:27.570 --> 00:32:29.238
You could go pro, Sang-yeon.

00:32:30.073 --> 00:32:31.324
Ms. Pro.

00:32:31.908 --> 00:32:33.242
Being around Sang-yeon

00:32:34.535 --> 00:32:37.497
makes everything about me
feel so ordinary.

00:32:38.539 --> 00:32:40.959
Insignificant, even.

00:32:46.255 --> 00:32:48.549
I'd like to express emotions…

00:32:50.468 --> 00:32:52.136
Why didn't you share your photos?

00:32:53.179 --> 00:32:56.516
Didn't you develop the photos
of the rice cake and side dish shops?

00:32:58.059 --> 00:33:01.145
I did. I developed them, but…

00:33:01.229 --> 00:33:03.982
Let's see them.
You said you'd pick one for the exhibit.

00:33:05.608 --> 00:33:07.944
I might just go with something else.

00:33:08.027 --> 00:33:09.028
Something else?

00:33:09.112 --> 00:33:09.946
Yeah.

00:33:10.613 --> 00:33:14.575
They’re all just photos of people,
so they feel a bit too simple.

00:33:15.076 --> 00:33:16.703
How so? I think they'd be great.

00:33:23.626 --> 00:33:24.919
What is it?

00:33:26.087 --> 00:33:28.047
What's got you feeling down?

00:33:34.345 --> 00:33:35.430
It's just

00:33:37.265 --> 00:33:42.562
your photos have a special something,
and so do Sang-yeon's.

00:33:43.146 --> 00:33:45.356
Mine seem too ordinary in comparison.

00:33:46.065 --> 00:33:46.899
They do?

00:33:48.401 --> 00:33:49.235
Yeah.

00:33:51.029 --> 00:33:52.739
When I look at the two of you,

00:33:53.239 --> 00:33:56.075
it’s clear how talented
and curious you both are.

00:33:57.326 --> 00:33:59.370
I bet you'll both succeed
in whatever you do.

00:34:01.039 --> 00:34:02.248
And you won't?

00:34:02.999 --> 00:34:03.833
No.

00:34:06.586 --> 00:34:08.129
What is it you want to do?

00:34:13.134 --> 00:34:13.968
Me?

00:34:15.553 --> 00:34:17.221
I'm not really good at anything--

00:34:17.305 --> 00:34:18.681
You're eloquent.

00:34:22.185 --> 00:34:23.644
How am I eloquent?

00:34:25.813 --> 00:34:28.941
Come on. Don't be like that
over something so small.

00:34:29.901 --> 00:34:31.652
You have me, don't you?

00:34:34.822 --> 00:34:35.656
What?

00:34:39.869 --> 00:34:41.370
What's that supposed to mean?

00:34:42.121 --> 00:34:42.955
What?

00:34:44.165 --> 00:34:46.292
-What is it?
-What did you mean by that?

00:34:47.585 --> 00:34:48.586
Mean by what?

00:34:49.087 --> 00:34:51.005
-I just--
-Do you think you're all I need?

00:34:52.673 --> 00:34:53.508
Eun-jung.

00:34:53.591 --> 00:34:55.593
No matter how much I like you

00:34:56.177 --> 00:34:58.763
or how proud I am
to call you my boyfriend,

00:34:58.846 --> 00:35:01.808
your achievements are yours, not mine.

00:35:04.268 --> 00:35:08.147
That's not what I meant. I just think
your photos are perfectly fine--

00:35:08.231 --> 00:35:10.733
Perfectly fine isn't good enough!

00:35:13.569 --> 00:35:14.445
Eun-jung.

00:35:41.514 --> 00:35:43.599
There are things even he can't do.

00:35:45.601 --> 00:35:47.562
He could never calm this anxiety.

00:35:48.729 --> 00:35:50.148
I wanted to know.

00:35:51.524 --> 00:35:54.610
I wanted to line up
all the 21-year-olds in the world

00:35:55.361 --> 00:35:57.113
to know where I stood amongst them.

00:35:57.613 --> 00:36:01.659
To know what I was capable of
and what I couldn't dream of doing.

00:36:30.396 --> 00:36:34.233
Why aren't you answering? Please pick up.

00:36:35.026 --> 00:36:36.694
I need you to talk to me.

00:36:38.237 --> 00:36:42.033
But I really do admire the things you say.
Your photos too.

00:36:42.116 --> 00:36:44.619
They're not just fine.
They're really good.

00:36:59.050 --> 00:37:02.303
I just woke up,
and I'm feeling pretty embarrassed.

00:37:03.221 --> 00:37:05.097
I'm sorry I took my anger out on you.

00:37:21.364 --> 00:37:22.949
You managed to rest, did you?

00:37:34.961 --> 00:37:36.045
I'm sorry.

00:37:36.712 --> 00:37:39.090
I'll forgive you
because you seem really sorry.

00:37:40.508 --> 00:37:41.342
Okay.

00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:46.597
Let's see.

00:37:48.140 --> 00:37:49.392
You're wearing this?

00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:54.313
I forgot! Give me one minute.

00:37:55.690 --> 00:37:57.108
-Just one minute!
-Okay.

00:37:58.442 --> 00:37:59.819
Go, Korea!

00:37:59.902 --> 00:38:03.072
In June of that year,
the entire country was buzzing.

00:38:04.573 --> 00:38:05.700
Go, Korea!

00:38:05.783 --> 00:38:08.953
Ahn Jung-hwan shoots! And he scores!

00:38:10.913 --> 00:38:14.375
Ahn Jung-hwan!

00:38:28.889 --> 00:38:31.058
Hong Myung-bo!

00:38:32.226 --> 00:38:36.939
He shoots, and he scores!
Korea is through to the semifinals!

00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:41.235
Team Korea is through to the semis!
The actual semifinals!

00:38:41.319 --> 00:38:44.613
This is incredible.
A very emotional moment for us all.

00:39:14.101 --> 00:39:16.062
What were you thinking about earlier?

00:39:17.980 --> 00:39:18.981
Earlier when?

00:39:20.274 --> 00:39:21.609
During the shoot-out.

00:39:23.819 --> 00:39:26.864
I'm not too sure.
What was I thinking about again?

00:39:28.657 --> 00:39:32.953
I guess I was thinking,
"People really like this kind of stuff."

00:39:33.871 --> 00:39:34.997
That sort of thing.

00:39:37.124 --> 00:39:38.167
Don't you like this?

00:39:38.250 --> 00:39:41.212
Of course I do. It's the semifinals.

00:39:52.223 --> 00:39:54.058
Eun-jung, do you ever feel that way?

00:39:59.730 --> 00:40:01.982
As if you snap and break away.

00:40:09.782 --> 00:40:11.450
Feeling detached, I suppose.

00:40:15.371 --> 00:40:18.040
You strive to pretend,

00:40:19.417 --> 00:40:21.419
trying to make something your reality,

00:40:22.962 --> 00:40:26.715
but you simply can't keep up
and just come to a halt.

00:40:35.516 --> 00:40:36.934
Like being snapped away.

00:40:43.357 --> 00:40:45.234
Are you reminded of your brother?

00:40:47.528 --> 00:40:48.487
Cheon Sang-hak?

00:40:49.989 --> 00:40:50.990
Yeah.

00:40:52.408 --> 00:40:55.119
I've been meaning to ask you.

00:40:56.328 --> 00:40:57.496
You always talk as if--

00:40:57.580 --> 00:40:59.623
He's still alive?

00:41:02.168 --> 00:41:03.002
Yeah.

00:41:08.132 --> 00:41:11.760
There must be people
who knew him in the past

00:41:13.012 --> 00:41:15.890
who are still unaware that he's gone.

00:41:18.309 --> 00:41:22.354
They must think that he's somewhere,

00:41:23.189 --> 00:41:24.106
alive and well.

00:41:26.859 --> 00:41:30.196
Or since they assume he's well,

00:41:31.238 --> 00:41:33.240
maybe he never even crosses their minds?

00:41:36.035 --> 00:41:39.497
It's like that for me too.
He never even crosses my mind.

00:41:52.927 --> 00:41:55.137
Eun-jung, let's go.

00:41:55.221 --> 00:41:57.056
Okay. Let's go.

00:42:10.110 --> 00:42:13.322
I can't help but like you.

00:42:13.405 --> 00:42:14.365
So annoying.

00:42:16.116 --> 00:42:17.159
Why? What is?

00:42:18.702 --> 00:42:19.662
Forget it.

00:42:24.166 --> 00:42:26.669
What do you mean, what?
You're annoying, of course.

00:42:28.087 --> 00:42:29.880
-What did I do to annoy--
-I'm annoyed.

00:42:29.964 --> 00:42:31.882
Cheon Sang-yeon, you're so annoying.

00:42:33.425 --> 00:42:35.302
Hey, what did I do?

00:42:35.386 --> 00:42:36.887
BALANCE: 723,254 WON

00:42:36.971 --> 00:42:38.597
Only 720,000 won?

00:43:04.790 --> 00:43:06.500
Hello, sir.

00:43:06.584 --> 00:43:07.918
Welcome.

00:43:08.419 --> 00:43:10.546
-I'd like to sell these books.
-Sure.

00:43:10.629 --> 00:43:12.381
Mom, please.

00:43:12.464 --> 00:43:13.757
No.

00:43:14.300 --> 00:43:15.843
Come on, Mom. Please?

00:43:15.926 --> 00:43:17.386
I said no.

00:43:18.220 --> 00:43:19.680
It's just that--

00:43:19.763 --> 00:43:22.391
Hey! No means no!

00:43:23.183 --> 00:43:26.103
Why would you move out
when you have a perfectly good home?

00:43:26.604 --> 00:43:28.355
-If you think about--
-Zip it!

00:43:29.690 --> 00:43:32.151
Lift your foot. And the other one.

00:43:49.418 --> 00:43:51.420
-Sir, I only rode this a few times.
-I see.

00:43:51.503 --> 00:43:53.756
So these brakes are practically new.

00:43:54.757 --> 00:43:58.844
Well, even so…
40,000 won should be reasonable.

00:43:58.927 --> 00:44:01.055
But this bike changes gears, and--

00:44:01.138 --> 00:44:03.182
The tires are pretty much flat.

00:44:03.265 --> 00:44:05.893
-But filling them with air costs nothing.
-That's not true.

00:44:05.976 --> 00:44:09.938
Come on, please? Mom, please.

00:44:11.523 --> 00:44:12.399
Move it.

00:44:13.150 --> 00:44:16.654
Why don't you just sell everything off?
Why not sell me off too?

00:44:17.529 --> 00:44:20.115
I just need you to pitch in
one million won.

00:44:20.199 --> 00:44:22.910
On second thought, just 500,000. Please?

00:44:22.993 --> 00:44:25.621
Come on. It's Sang-yeon.

00:44:29.249 --> 00:44:30.501
How much is the deposit?

00:44:31.710 --> 00:44:33.379
-500,000 won.
-500,000?

00:44:33.879 --> 00:44:38.008
Then let's add 2.5 million to that
and find a place with a 3 million deposit.

00:44:41.970 --> 00:44:44.640
Is your mom really okay with this?

00:44:44.723 --> 00:44:47.017
Of course, she said no at first.

00:44:47.518 --> 00:44:50.270
But she changed her mind
when I said I'd be living with you.

00:44:53.065 --> 00:44:55.442
-I would love that, but--
-That's settled, then.

00:44:55.943 --> 00:44:59.780
Let's start searching tomorrow.
There's that photography trip next week…

00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:05.411
Are you really not coming this time?

00:45:06.203 --> 00:45:08.580
It's a trip to Gangneung.
Why would I go there?

00:45:08.664 --> 00:45:09.998
But still…

00:45:11.333 --> 00:45:14.169
It's Sang-hak's last trip
before joining the military.

00:45:18.382 --> 00:45:21.009
He's going to the military?

00:45:22.219 --> 00:45:23.053
Yes.

00:45:26.890 --> 00:45:27.933
When?

00:45:28.016 --> 00:45:31.812
July 16th, so in just three weeks.

00:46:30.913 --> 00:46:32.080
I'm not going in.

00:46:41.924 --> 00:46:44.551
Sang-yeon, there's something
really cool over there.

00:46:45.636 --> 00:46:46.970
-Whoa, no way!
-No way!

00:46:48.639 --> 00:46:50.140
In you go!

00:46:55.395 --> 00:46:57.105
Guys! How could you?

00:46:59.024 --> 00:47:02.152
It's so cold.
Why is it so cold in the summer?

00:47:02.236 --> 00:47:05.572
Because it's technically not summer.
It's still June.

00:47:07.282 --> 00:47:08.700
Aren't you glad you came?

00:47:09.201 --> 00:47:12.538
No. What was I thinking
when I agreed to come here?

00:47:13.539 --> 00:47:15.040
I know you're having fun.

00:47:16.625 --> 00:47:20.212
Now that I'm here,
I would love to see Ms. Yoon.

00:47:22.256 --> 00:47:24.383
Should we pay her a quick visit
before dinner?

00:47:25.425 --> 00:47:26.260
No.

00:47:27.970 --> 00:47:31.265
We're here anyway. Wouldn't she be upset?

00:47:32.307 --> 00:47:35.143
She doesn't even know we're here.
Why would she be upset?

00:47:37.771 --> 00:47:42.484
Was it supposed to be a secret?
I actually called her earlier.

00:47:44.361 --> 00:47:45.279
A secret to whom?

00:47:46.905 --> 00:47:49.074
Ms. Yoon. Sang-yeon's mom.

00:47:50.200 --> 00:47:53.370
Did you tell her that we're here?

00:47:56.039 --> 00:48:00.502
She didn’t answer, so I couldn't tell her.
I just didn’t realize it was a secret.

00:48:05.716 --> 00:48:06.592
It's Ms. Yoon.

00:48:11.597 --> 00:48:12.931
Hello, Ms. Yoon.

00:48:13.640 --> 00:48:16.977
I just thought I'd give you a call.

00:48:17.060 --> 00:48:19.104
I hear your mother's a great person.

00:48:21.732 --> 00:48:22.816
My mom?

00:48:23.525 --> 00:48:26.570
Eun-jung says your mom is the person
she respects the most.

00:48:28.739 --> 00:48:33.452
She said she always felt timid at school
because she didn't have a father,

00:48:34.077 --> 00:48:36.163
but your mom helped fill that void.

00:48:40.542 --> 00:48:41.793
She filled that void?

00:48:42.794 --> 00:48:46.048
Yes, Ms. Yoon. I'll come visit you soon.

00:48:47.299 --> 00:48:49.593
Of course. Take care.

00:48:53.055 --> 00:48:54.890
I didn't tell her we're here.

00:48:58.143 --> 00:49:00.187
Let's go see my mom, then.

00:49:01.772 --> 00:49:03.023
You should come too.

00:49:08.528 --> 00:49:13.075
I don't get you. I even lied
because you asked me not to tell her.

00:49:13.158 --> 00:49:14.576
We'll say it's a surprise.

00:49:15.077 --> 00:49:17.079
Are you sure it's okay
to just show up like this?

00:49:17.579 --> 00:49:19.039
Maybe I should wait outside.

00:49:19.122 --> 00:49:21.833
My mom will be happy to see you.

00:49:38.850 --> 00:49:39.768
Who is it?

00:49:40.352 --> 00:49:41.186
It's me.

00:49:42.396 --> 00:49:43.563
Sang-yeon, is that you?

00:49:43.647 --> 00:49:44.481
Yeah.

00:49:44.982 --> 00:49:48.068
Why, you should have called
to say you were coming.

00:49:51.863 --> 00:49:53.115
Eun-jung.

00:49:58.161 --> 00:49:59.204
Ms. Yoon.

00:50:02.165 --> 00:50:03.125
Ms. Yoon.

00:50:05.502 --> 00:50:07.337
It's so good to see you.

00:50:08.005 --> 00:50:10.007
What brought you all this way?

00:50:12.843 --> 00:50:14.302
Hello, ma'am. I am…

00:50:14.386 --> 00:50:18.557
This is Sang-hak oppa.
We're in the same photography club.

00:50:25.689 --> 00:50:29.693
Did I mention that my brother is
also named Sang-hak? Cheon Sang-hak.

00:50:42.622 --> 00:50:45.834
Where are my manners?
Please come inside. Come in.

00:50:55.260 --> 00:50:56.636
Come this way.

00:51:00.182 --> 00:51:01.892
-Please take a seat here.
-Yes.

00:51:01.975 --> 00:51:02.809
Right here.

00:51:03.727 --> 00:51:06.855
If I'd known you were coming,
I would have bought some food.

00:51:07.355 --> 00:51:11.777
It's fine. We had a late lunch,
so you don't need to put anything out.

00:51:12.694 --> 00:51:14.321
All I have is plum extract.

00:51:16.031 --> 00:51:18.116
I love plum extract.

00:51:22.287 --> 00:51:23.955
Are you close with your mom?

00:51:26.416 --> 00:51:29.044
-Well…
-My mom is super close with my brother.

00:51:30.253 --> 00:51:35.509
I bet she loves him
more than anyone else in the entire world.

00:51:51.024 --> 00:51:52.776
-We need one more…
-Right.

00:51:58.073 --> 00:51:59.699
I'm sorry I had no food.

00:51:59.783 --> 00:52:04.329
It’s fine. We’re having a barbecue,
so we'll be eating soon anyway.

00:52:04.830 --> 00:52:07.374
All right, then. Take care.

00:52:08.750 --> 00:52:09.835
Eun-jung, you too.

00:52:11.169 --> 00:52:12.462
I'll call.

00:52:12.546 --> 00:52:13.380
Okay.

00:52:16.925 --> 00:52:17.843
Eun-jung?

00:52:27.894 --> 00:52:33.692
TO SANG-HAK OPPA

00:52:35.610 --> 00:52:36.778
Do you remember this?

00:52:38.989 --> 00:52:41.741
I couldn't throw away
such a beautiful letter.

00:52:43.535 --> 00:52:47.330
I don't think Sang-hak even knew
that it was there.

00:52:51.585 --> 00:52:52.919
I know it wasn't mine to read.

00:52:53.420 --> 00:52:56.006
I'm sorry I read it
without your permission.

00:53:26.203 --> 00:53:28.413
You said your father
gave you that clover, right?

00:53:32.751 --> 00:53:33.585
Yes.

00:53:36.963 --> 00:53:38.673
Thank you for gifting

00:53:40.425 --> 00:53:42.844
something so precious to my son.

00:54:01.863 --> 00:54:03.365
I'm sorry.

00:54:07.035 --> 00:54:07.953
I'm sorry.

00:54:11.998 --> 00:54:12.958
Eun-jung.

00:54:35.480 --> 00:54:37.148
They are taking a long time.

00:54:45.824 --> 00:54:47.867
They do this every time they meet.

00:54:49.577 --> 00:54:51.579
They're practically best friends.

00:54:55.125 --> 00:54:56.626
That was an exaggeration.

00:54:59.921 --> 00:55:01.006
Her favorite student?

00:55:04.092 --> 00:55:08.680
Eun-jung was my mom's favorite
even though she wasn't in her class.

00:55:10.682 --> 00:55:12.350
I suppose it was all worth it

00:55:12.434 --> 00:55:15.520
since Eun-jung still considers Mom
an amazing person.

00:55:17.605 --> 00:55:20.734
It makes sense since Mom even
played favorites with her children.

00:55:25.363 --> 00:55:27.991
She clearly preferred my brother to me.

00:55:29.826 --> 00:55:31.453
She never tried to hide it.

00:55:34.539 --> 00:55:36.207
Some kind of mom, isn't she?

00:55:36.291 --> 00:55:37.876
You can stop talking.

00:55:42.589 --> 00:55:43.882
It must have been tough.

00:55:59.105 --> 00:56:00.523
Of course it was tough.

00:56:03.318 --> 00:56:05.320
I deserve to be more rebellious.

00:56:08.740 --> 00:56:11.117
My mom would have no right to judge me.

01:00:24.412 --> 01:00:29.417
