00:01:14.559 --> 00:01:16.679
Pei Yuze! Are you in there?

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:21.440
Yuze!

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:23.880
What's wrong?

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:29.719
Take this, quickly!

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.600
What happened?

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.520
Yuze! Yuze!

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.038
Someone! Help! Help!

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.959
Anyone!

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.580
(Pei Residence)

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.200
Are you feeling better?

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.760
I'm fine.

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:05.518
I'm sorry, Second Master.

00:02:05.519 --> 00:02:07.038
If Miss Lian hadn't shown up
just in time,

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.679
I...

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:08.840
It's not your fault.

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.720
Who was the one who drew you away?

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:13.959
I didn't get a good look.

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.078
I only remember they moved
in a very unusual way.

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:17.399
I've never seen anyone like that.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.600
You've never seen them...

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.038
Didn't your poison act up not long ago?

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:24.479
Why did it happen again so soon?

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.720
The traveling doctor said the flare-ups
were getting more frequent, which means...

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.200
It's not the worst yet.

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:36.920
Don't worry.

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:40.199
Where's your medicine?
Why didn't you have it on you?

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.320
Jiang Yao took it away.

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:54.639
Xinruo, I...

00:02:56.799 --> 00:02:58.598
How could you do that, Jiang Yao?

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:00.639
We've spent so many years together.

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.118
You actually hit me because of Pei Yuze?

00:03:03.119 --> 00:03:04.758
Look at the state you're in.

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:07.119
Are you still
the Jiang Yao I first knew?

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:08.639
I love you.

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:10.959
That hasn't changed.

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:12.520
I admit

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:15.758
I wanted Wu Peirong to kill Pei Yuze.

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:17.278
But I never intended to hurt you!

00:03:17.279 --> 00:03:18.838
I don't want to hear any of this now.

00:03:18.839 --> 00:03:20.078
I only have one question.

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:21.079
Where's Jin Se?

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:23.919
Jin Se? I don't know.

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.598
You're still denying it!

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:27.279
No, I really don't know.

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:30.318
Yuze never wanted to fight you
for the family head position.

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:33.199
It's your jealousy and hunger for power

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.159
that blinded you,

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:35.518
making him your imagined enemy.

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:36.639
You're pathetic.

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:38.919
I'm telling the truth.

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.080
Why won't you believe me?

00:03:42.119 --> 00:03:43.199
You're not worthy.

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:45.278
Even sharing a roof with you right now

00:03:45.279 --> 00:03:46.839
makes me sick.

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.500
(Pei Residence)

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:00.559
I had a doctor examine

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:01.879
the pills you gave me.

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:03.919
The doctor said
they're some sort of antidote.

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:04.758
An antidote?

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:05.879
For what kind of poison?

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:06.758
Not sure.

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:08.758
But those pills are incredibly strong.

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:10.639
It must be some deadly poison.

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:13.199
Got it. You may leave.

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.240
Yes, sir.

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:19.440
So he was poisoned all along.

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:22.280
Then what was

00:04:23.599 --> 00:04:25.239
all this for?

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.400
Miss Xueshan.

00:04:32.359 --> 00:04:34.519
Dr. Fang, what brings you here?

00:04:34.559 --> 00:04:37.078
I was foolish
and borrowed money for stocks.

00:04:37.079 --> 00:04:38.838
The whole thing went underwater.

00:04:38.839 --> 00:04:42.760
Can't you help me,
after all these years of doing favors for you?

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:44.200
Help?

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:46.078
How?

00:04:46.079 --> 00:04:48.239
Could you give me 50,000?

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:50.640
50,000?

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.040
Your appetite is a bit much, isn't it?

00:04:54.319 --> 00:04:55.559
Miss Xueshan.

00:04:56.279 --> 00:04:57.558
Don't forget

00:04:57.559 --> 00:05:00.318
who covered for you in front
of the Second Master back then.

00:05:00.319 --> 00:05:02.159
If you don't give me the money,

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.560
I'll have to go to him instead.

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:07.400
Fine.

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.960
I'll help you this once.

00:05:10.279 --> 00:05:12.999
But only once.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.038
Thank you, Miss Xueshan.

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:15.319
Thank you.

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.040
For convenience,

00:05:17.079 --> 00:05:19.639
I want that money as a check

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:21.319
plus a box of gold.

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:22.400
All right.

00:05:22.559 --> 00:05:23.559
Thank you.

00:05:23.599 --> 00:05:24.799
I'll take my leave now.

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.519
Second Master, I found a letter for you

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:38.879
in the mailbox.

00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:43.679
We just returned
to the Lian Residence last night.

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.600
How did someone find out so quickly?

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:48.220
(Meet me at Leshan Hall, western woods)

00:05:54.820 --> 00:06:00.300
(Meet me at Leshan Hall, western woods,
4PM, learn the truth of your poisoning.)

00:06:05.359 --> 00:06:06.759
Here's what you wanted.

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:15.420
(Twenty-five thousand yuan only)

00:06:15.839 --> 00:06:17.798
You're a lifesaver, Miss Xueshan.

00:06:17.799 --> 00:06:19.199
I will keep this secret

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:20.558
and never tell anyone.

00:06:20.559 --> 00:06:23.598
You better keep your word.

00:06:23.599 --> 00:06:24.639
Rest assured.

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:27.080
Not another soul will know about this.

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:33.440
Promises mean nothing.

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:36.240
Only the dead keep secrets.

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:44.719
Yuze, I can't shake this unease.

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:46.199
Do you think it might be a trap?

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:48.459
Don't worry. I've asked Wen Yuan
to set up an ambush nearby.

00:06:48.459 --> 00:06:50.119
Whatever happens, we'll get out safe.

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:58.700
(Leshan Hall)

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:04.240
Well?

00:07:06.079 --> 00:07:07.279
The body still feels warm.

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:09.080
He must have died recently.

00:07:09.839 --> 00:07:12.719
If Dr. Fang sent us that letter,
then whoever killed him

00:07:13.039 --> 00:07:14.559
is the real culprit

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:16.680
behind your poisoning.

00:07:17.279 --> 00:07:20.599
Curses. After all this effort,
our lead is gone again.

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:48.520
Not a single reaction
after all this time. Boring.

00:07:50.039 --> 00:07:52.199
You're as dull as Lian Xinruo.

00:07:52.319 --> 00:07:54.479
I don't know what Jiang Yao sees in her.

00:07:57.279 --> 00:07:58.319
Miss Xueshan.

00:07:59.799 --> 00:08:01.239
Did you talk to anyone on the way?

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:02.080
No.

00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:12.859
(Twenty-five thousand yuan only)

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:15.380
(Pei Xueshan)

00:08:16.279 --> 00:08:17.639
Pei Xueshan?

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:21.520
Where's the check?

00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:24.279
Where's the check? Where is it?

00:08:24.499 --> 00:08:25.499
Find it and bring it back!

00:08:25.499 --> 00:08:26.559
You bring back that check!

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:27.119
Yes.

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:29.600
And make sure to grind him to dust!

00:08:31.319 --> 00:08:33.039
He dared to extort me!

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:34.759
They should all just die!

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:35.960
All of them!

00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:38.879
He was already poisoned!
Why is he still alive?

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:40.278
And that Lian Xinruo!

00:08:40.279 --> 00:08:41.999
She's always causing trouble!

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.360
She should die too!

00:08:53.319 --> 00:08:54.999
You may not be fun,

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:57.280
but you're my last toy.

00:08:58.159 --> 00:09:01.439
Don't worry. I won't let you die.

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:03.479
Once I control Hu City,

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:06.480
Pei Yuze and Lian Xinruo
will keep you company.

00:09:09.359 --> 00:09:10.559
Make sure she stays alive.

00:09:19.279 --> 00:09:21.519
I was 17 when I was poisoned.

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:24.640
I barely spent any time
with Pei Xueshan.

00:09:25.239 --> 00:09:27.719
That's why we never suspected her.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.600
But why would
she do something like this?

00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:32.758
Of course,

00:09:32.759 --> 00:09:34.198
just having a check

00:09:34.199 --> 00:09:35.919
doesn't prove
she's linked to my poisoning.

00:09:36.159 --> 00:09:37.639
I've already had someone watch her.

00:09:37.719 --> 00:09:39.359
We'll know if she tries anything else.

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:42.320
We'll wait to hear from Wen Yuan too.

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:45.080
Pei Xueshan will definitely turn back
to look for the check

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:47.278
when she finds it missing.

00:09:47.279 --> 00:09:49.439
We can follow that trail

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:51.160
to see if there's more to find.

00:09:55.319 --> 00:09:56.199
Yes?

00:09:57.679 --> 00:09:58.599
Got it.

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:03.880
Wen Yuan found something. Let's go.

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:14.680
This is bad. She can't die yet.

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:31.358
As you expected,

00:10:31.359 --> 00:10:33.599
someone did turn back last night
looking for the check,

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:35.680
and I saw who it was.

00:10:35.759 --> 00:10:37.879
It was the same man who lured me away

00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:39.879
when Jiang Yao was trapped.

00:10:40.359 --> 00:10:42.158
Have you found where he's hiding?

00:10:42.159 --> 00:10:43.879
I followed him back to Hu City

00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:46.399
but lost him nearby.

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:47.358
Oddly enough,

00:10:47.359 --> 00:10:49.238
the guy following Pei Xueshan

00:10:49.239 --> 00:10:51.238
said she was here
this afternoon as well.

00:10:51.239 --> 00:10:54.079
He lost track of her
somewhere nearby too.

00:10:54.679 --> 00:10:56.678
Their operations are secretive,

00:10:56.679 --> 00:10:58.198
and all take place
somewhere around here.

00:10:58.199 --> 00:10:59.759
There has to be something going on.

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:07.560
