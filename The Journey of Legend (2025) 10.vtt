[The Journey of Legend]

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.940
[Episode 10]

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.900
Today, I'm going to spar with you all.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.670
If anyone can take

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.570
the Hero Command Token from me,

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.430
I'll honor him as a real man.

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.030
I'll hand over the token

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:01.870
and give him the Voidheart Codex.

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.340
If you can't defeat me, Crazy Yan,

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.840
you'll have to follow my orders
from now on!

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:35.280
Who else?

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.060
You attacked us with hidden weapons.

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.940
I'm done playing with you all.

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:28.880
"Behold the divine token of mystery."

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:31.010
“All heroes shall bow immediately.”

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:32.470
Suifeng,

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:35.290
do you know what this token signifies?

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.300
Everyone in the martial world knows.

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:39.190
That's right.

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:42.630
When the leaders of Shaolin Sect,
Wudang Sect, and Emei Sect

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:43.920
made this token,

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:45.510
they pressed their fingerprints

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:47.000
on it.

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:51.720
Take a look at the fingerprints on it.

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:56.680
No fingerprints.

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:58.390
It's fake.

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:01.660
Actually, there's one more thing.

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:04.510
There's only one Mr. Qiu in Sword Manor.

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:07.510
How can we be sure there isn't a second?

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:11.230
Qiushui, your thoughts...

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:15.190
What I mean is—

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:17.860
everyone is fighting to seize

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:20.460
the Hero Command Token
in Old Madam Wu's hands.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.530
To ensure absolute safety,

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:23.850
Old Madam Wu,

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:26.710
you must consider an alternative plan.

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:29.260
Xiao Qiushui.

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:32.630
It must be him.

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:37.510
Chief,

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:40.240
Liu Suifeng is known
for his flawless strategies.

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:41.360
He's incredibly clever.

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.430
How could anyone possibly deceive him?

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:46.190
He must have hidden the real token
to fool you.

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:47.140
Chief,

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:48.950
he lost men

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:51.110
and returned empty-handed.

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:53.400
Shouldn't he give an explanation?

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:10.560
-Chief.
-Chief.

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:14.510
Suifeng's Cosmos in the Sleeve technique

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:15.950
has reached a new level.

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:17.870
Tell me,

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:23.560
should this petal remain on its branch?

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:25.120
Or...

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:28.620
should it be plucked into one's hand?

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:34.430
Chief,

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:36.310
plucking it from the branch

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:38.510
grants but a moment of fleeting beauty.

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:40.290
Only by remaining on the branch

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:41.820
can its fragrance endure.

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:46.390
The Power Gang is the branch.

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:48.040
We are but its blossoms.

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:50.120
If we fight, we fall from the branch.

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:52.720
Only by clinging close
can we retain our grace.

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:57.240
I believe
Suifeng was merely careless this time.

00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:00.560
He's been overworked these years.

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:02.350
That's why he fell short.

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:03.430
After today,

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:05.680
let Sword King and Suifeng

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:09.450
investigate
the token's whereabouts together.

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:27.870
[Chief,]

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:30.980
[I will get
the Hero Command Token for you.]

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:35.000
[Then I will come to apologize to you.]

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:11.620
You're injured. You shouldn't be drinking.

00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:19.930
I'm the one who lost a brother.

00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:22.200
If anyone should be drinking, it's me.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:28.800
Rou.

00:08:34.429 --> 00:08:35.760
I failed to protect you.

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:39.049
Life is unpredictable.

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:42.240
What could you have done anyway?

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:44.960
At first, I thought

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:50.500
the martial world was simple.

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:54.520
As long as I was smart and played it safe,

00:08:55.550 --> 00:08:57.550
I could overcome the difficulties.

00:08:58.510 --> 00:09:01.600
I thought
loyalty came first in the martial world.

00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:05.480
As long as I treated my friends sincerely,

00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:10.490
we could trust each other unconditionally.

00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:15.630
I thought

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:18.570
I could change fate.

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:22.290
Unfortunately,

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:27.900
those were just my wishful thinking.

00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:34.670
In the end,

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:40.360
I accomplished nothing.

00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:46.480
Now I understand

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:50.150
why Tang Rou trusted you so much

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:53.790
and wouldn't come home all day,

00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:55.390
refusing to leave your side.

00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:59.320
Regardless of life or death,
success or failure,

00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:00.910
regardless of gain or loss,

00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:03.390
you do what you want to do.

00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:05.470
Xiao Qiushui,

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:09.360
you live a life others envy,

00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:12.200
yet it feels almost unreal.

00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:15.510
Yes.

00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:20.040
It really does feel unreal.

00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:26.270
The martial world is treacherous,

00:10:26.270 --> 00:10:28.130
and human hearts are hard to read.

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:31.840
People scheme endlessly

00:10:32.510 --> 00:10:33.570
for what they want.

00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:36.210
How many ever treat others

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:39.000
with the sincerity you show?

00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:47.910
I don't know anything about fate,

00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:49.870
but I do know this:

00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:53.510
when Feng Lang kidnapped me,

00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:56.760
you risked your life to save me.

00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:58.440
Otherwise,

00:10:59.670 --> 00:11:01.200
I wouldn't be here now

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:02.600
talking to you like this.

00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:06.490
Don't forget what you said

00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:07.550
to Tang Rou.

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:10.420
We'll avenge him together

00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:13.720
against the Power Gang.

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:02.550
Mr. Zhang,

00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:09.030
let the matters of the martial world

00:12:10.050 --> 00:12:11.650
remain in the martial world.

00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:20.630
Mr. Zhang helped me
keep the Hero Command Token.

00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:23.200
Feng Lang didn't take it.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.670
This game is not completely lost yet.

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:30.000
Mr. Zhang

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:32.240
stayed by my side for many years.

00:12:33.790 --> 00:12:37.440
I understand his thoughts
better than anyone.

00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:43.480
He had long been indifferent
to life and death in the martial world.

00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:45.440
Staying by my side was

00:12:46.270 --> 00:12:48.270
only for the sake of loyalty.

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:50.720
And now,

00:12:52.510 --> 00:12:55.910
he saw that same quality in you.

00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:59.390
Today, when he regained consciousness,

00:12:59.390 --> 00:13:02.750
he told me if he could have a disciple,

00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:05.790
he would want one like you, Qiushui.

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:14.150
This dagger was
Mr. Zhang's most personal possession.

00:13:14.630 --> 00:13:17.080
He asked me to give it to you.

00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:20.870
If you become a true hero soon,

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:23.420
that would fulfill Mr. Zhang's wish.

00:13:32.630 --> 00:13:36.030
I'm grateful
for your and Mr. Zhang's kindness.

00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:49.640
Sword Manor is still in trouble.

00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:53.600
My son's old cavalry troops are stationed
in the mountains.

00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:56.300
If I order them to rescue Sword Manor,

00:13:56.950 --> 00:13:59.240
we could solve the Xiao family's problem.

00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:00.440
That must not happen.

00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:01.760
Old Madam Wu,

00:14:02.390 --> 00:14:03.910
I want to save my parents

00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:07.120
and everyone of the Xiao family.

00:14:07.190 --> 00:14:10.650
But the Xiao family's trouble is a matter
in the martial world.

00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:13.690
If we rashly deploy military cavalry,

00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:15.630
the garrison forces in Jindu

00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:17.670
will surely clash with them.

00:14:18.390 --> 00:14:20.650
Then the people in the city would suffer,

00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:25.320
and the court would
grow even more suspicious of General Wu.

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:32.470
Then what should we do about Sword Manor?

00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:37.150
I'd like to ask you to send a messenger

00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:40.350
on horseback to Guangling Villa

00:14:40.350 --> 00:14:42.550
to deliver a letter to my brother
to ask for help.

00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:45.790
Tomorrow, I will set out to seek aid
from various sects in Jinzhong.

00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:48.120
I have support from my sworn brothers too.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.390
I will do everything in my power
to save the Xiao family.

00:14:54.750 --> 00:14:55.390
Okay.

00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:58.320
Tomorrow I'll send someone to Guangling

00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:00.320
to deliver a letter to your brother.

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:06.030
After that,
I must focus on my son's matters.

00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:08.970
May the Xiao family

00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:11.610
remain safe through this.

00:15:14.670 --> 00:15:16.000
Thank you, Old Madam Wu.

00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:57.200
Master.

00:15:58.670 --> 00:16:01.360
These Stone Pine Pills are great
for your health.

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:02.360
Try them, Master.

00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:16.560
Who do you think you are to me?

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:19.730
Focus on the tasks I assign you.

00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:21.710
Do not overstep the boundaries.

00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:25.750
Yes.

00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:38.870
Shirong.

00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:43.600
Are you still thinking
about what Chief said?

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:45.240
I dare not doubt his words.

00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:47.440
Remember this:

00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:50.160
do not force things beyond your limits.

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:52.520
Trying to do the work of many by yourself

00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:54.910
will inevitably lead to oversights.

00:16:54.910 --> 00:16:55.970
I admit my mistake.

00:16:57.510 --> 00:17:00.910
I heard this time, you used
the Turtle Snake Hibernation technique.

00:17:00.910 --> 00:17:02.640
It's very harmful to your body.

00:17:03.270 --> 00:17:05.400
I've brought you some Stone Pine Pills.

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:07.440
Take them. They should help.

00:17:12.270 --> 00:17:13.400
Thank you, Shirong.

00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:16.200
Rest well. I'm leaving.

00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:24.440
Do not

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:26.810
act on your own in certain matters.

00:32:06.310 --> 00:32:08.440
He would surely seek aid along the way.

00:32:09.070 --> 00:32:11.310
Unfortunately, all the sects in Jinzhong

00:32:11.310 --> 00:32:13.910
would never dare
stand against the Power Gang.

00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:16.730
But Tang Fang will help him.

00:32:19.070 --> 00:32:20.800
Contact Tang Sect's Tang Song.

00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:23.610
Would Tang Sect truly dare interfere?

00:32:24.070 --> 00:32:26.310
To become the leader of Tang Sect,

00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:28.960
Tang Song has repeatedly tried
to please the Power Gang.

00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:31.110
Master,
haven't you always looked down on him?

00:32:31.110 --> 00:32:31.750
Trash is

00:32:32.550 --> 00:32:34.070
not entirely useless.

00:32:35.310 --> 00:32:37.110
Offer Tang Song some incentives.

00:32:37.110 --> 00:32:38.840
Ask him to prepare thoroughly.

00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:40.450
Understood.

00:32:43.780 --> 00:32:45.080
[Ding's Mansion]

00:32:53.950 --> 00:32:55.110
I'd like to see

00:32:55.750 --> 00:32:58.410
how sick your master is
that he can't even get up!

00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:00.580
He wants to hide like a coward now?

00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:01.840
Tang Fang,

00:33:02.590 --> 00:33:03.390
don't be rude.

00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:05.520
Xiao Qiushui,

00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:07.920
you barged into my mansion
with this unruly girl.

00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:10.580
Do you mean to extort repayment
for past favors?

00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:15.200
I wonder
if you plan to repay the kindness.

00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:17.900
I simply don't want to act against reason

00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:20.550
and end up aiding those
with ulterior motives.

00:33:20.550 --> 00:33:21.830
Who knows if the Xiao family

00:33:21.830 --> 00:33:23.350
is truly as the rumors say—

00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:25.240
coveting the Hero Command Token

00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:28.000
and bringing the Power Gang's wrath
upon yourselves?

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:29.160
Watch your words!

00:33:31.550 --> 00:33:34.750
It's understandable
that you want to stay out of trouble.

00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:36.760
But why slander the Xiao family?

00:33:37.270 --> 00:33:39.070
What the Xiao family suffers today

00:33:39.070 --> 00:33:42.000
may befall the Ding family tomorrow.

00:33:42.270 --> 00:33:42.830
You...

00:33:43.110 --> 00:33:44.270
How dare you slander us!

00:33:44.270 --> 00:33:46.400
Are you trying to force us to violence?

00:33:46.830 --> 00:33:48.440
That ungrateful old weasel!

00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:49.110
Tang Fang.

00:33:50.110 --> 00:33:51.370
Don't bother with him.

00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:52.720
That weak man.

00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:54.230
Let's go.

00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:00.680
That Ding fellow—

00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:02.260
you don't need to beg him.

00:34:02.260 --> 00:34:03.350
He's a coward.

00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:04.530
We can go elsewhere.

00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:08.659
I'm afraid everyone
in the Chuanjin community is the same.

00:34:10.150 --> 00:34:10.840
Tang Fang.

00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:13.460
Thank you for your help along the way.

00:34:13.670 --> 00:34:14.630
Let's part here.

00:34:16.710 --> 00:34:17.320
Wait.

00:34:18.150 --> 00:34:19.280
Where are you going?

00:34:24.190 --> 00:34:27.650
Old Madam Wu has sent someone
to deliver a letter to my brother.

00:34:28.070 --> 00:34:29.130
Perhaps my brother

00:34:29.150 --> 00:34:32.110
can find heroes in the martial world
to save the Xiao family.

00:34:32.110 --> 00:34:34.590
So I need to go back to meet with them.

00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:38.739
There's still one family in Jinzhong
you haven't approached.

00:34:41.190 --> 00:34:42.000
You mean...

00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:44.620
Your Tang Sect?

00:34:50.510 --> 00:34:54.170
But Tang Sect never gets involved
in the martial world's affairs.

00:34:54.550 --> 00:34:55.560
As you said,

00:34:56.100 --> 00:34:58.030
what the Xiao family suffers today

00:34:58.320 --> 00:35:00.050
may befall Tang Sect tomorrow.

00:35:00.230 --> 00:35:02.310
Actually, Tang Rou asked me before

00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:06.610
why the Tang family
lets rats like the Power Gang run rampant

00:35:06.670 --> 00:35:09.670
instead of becoming
the foremost family in the world.

00:35:09.670 --> 00:35:11.710
I still want to try to persuade my father.

00:35:11.710 --> 00:35:12.670
But if I fail,

00:35:13.150 --> 00:35:14.810
I'll go with you to Guangling.

00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:15.920
What do you think?

00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:22.400
Okay.

00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:24.820
Then we can only try first.

00:35:27.190 --> 00:35:27.840
Tang Fang,

00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:30.040
thank you for your help.

00:35:33.150 --> 00:35:34.610
I can't promise anything.

00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:35.780
Let's just try.

Where's my father?

He's naturally handling family affairs
in the inner courtyard.

00:38:01.820 --> 00:38:04.150
You're being reckless with your brother.

00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:08.120
Aren't you worried
Old Madam Tang will punish you?

00:38:09.070 --> 00:38:10.480
You're the reckless one.

She favors you,

00:38:13.360 --> 00:38:16.020
so you can show no respect
for Tang Sect's rules?

Let's see
how long you can keep that defiant tongue.

00:38:23.670 --> 00:38:26.280
how dare you bring an outsider
to Tang Sect to seek reinforcements?

00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:29.190
And you had the audacity
to write in your letter to Master

00:38:29.190 --> 00:38:30.590
about returning a favor.

00:38:30.710 --> 00:38:31.920
How laughable.

You actually
opened my private letter to Father?

00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:38.480
You want to use the Tang family's power
to solve the Xiao family's crisis,

with the Power Gang.

This is no private matter.

Detaining you now

00:38:58.800 --> 00:38:59.840

for promising help to outsiders
without permission.

She's indeed defiant.

And the scheme of that Xiao boy

00:39:24.670 --> 00:39:25.670

can't see through it, do you?

just marry me obediently.

00:39:43.590 --> 00:39:45.960
I could cover this up for you.

00:39:46.670 --> 00:39:48.470
You're getting more shameless.

00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:52.210

I came back today
to seek help for the Xiao family.

The Power Gang is ruthless

00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:02.000
and has surrounded Xiao's Sword Manor.

00:41:02.540 --> 00:41:06.660
So you know the Power Gang is ruthless?

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:09.070
Then why do you want our entire family

00:41:09.070 --> 00:41:11.400
and the entire clan to stand against them?

00:41:15.470 --> 00:41:16.870
From the very beginning,

00:41:17.630 --> 00:41:20.070

are now in danger.

00:41:24.110 --> 00:41:25.880
How can I just stand by and do nothing?

00:41:25.880 --> 00:41:27.440
Do you think hiding and avoiding

00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:28.840
will keep trouble at bay?

00:42:11.740 --> 00:42:13.480
just like Qiushui and me today.

00:42:14.330 --> 00:42:14.990
But Father,

00:42:16.270 --> 00:42:19.500
why have you become
so cautious and hesitant now?

00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:26.620
If you refuse to help, so be it.

00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:29.630
I will do what I can for the Xiao family.

00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:31.440
You...

00:42:33.710 --> 00:42:34.630
Stop him!
