=Episode 17=

00:01:08.839 --> 00:01:10.679
Wu Peirong suddenly vanished.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.560
Jin Se is nowhere to be found.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.558
Even the cousin who was previously
suspected of poisoning you

00:01:15.559 --> 00:01:17.079
has been cleared.

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.160
All the leads disappeared overnight,

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:24.159
as if some invisible hand
is controlling everything

00:01:24.519 --> 00:01:26.799
behind the scenes.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.160
Do you think Jiang Yao is involved
in all this?

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.879
There's no direct evidence
proving he ordered it.

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.960
Jin Se is still missing,

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:38.759
and all traces of the antidote
have vanished.

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:40.840
We're running out of time.

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:50.639
Xinruo.

00:01:50.839 --> 00:01:52.798
Now that the Lian family is back
in your hands,

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.838
I've already removed the people

00:01:54.839 --> 00:01:56.199
Pei Yujie planted.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.200
I'll assign trustworthy people

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:59.880
to take their place.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.358
I want to hand over
the second branch's assets

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:03.558
to you as well.

00:02:03.559 --> 00:02:06.680
Pei Yuze, are you preparing me
for what happens after you're gone?

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.639
If some things are bound to happen,

00:02:14.119 --> 00:02:15.599
we must be prepared for them.

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.320
Xinruo, I'm not invincible.

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:27.559
Sometimes destiny just can't be changed.

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:29.359
But at least before I leave,

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.520
I want to do everything I can for you.

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.599
I don't believe in fate.

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.639
I believe people make things happen.

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.280
And I don't need
you making plans for me.

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:42.759
If we don't have the antidote,
then we'll find it.

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:45.399
I don't want to be powerless.

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:10.479
I'm sorry.

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:13.759
I shouldn't have lost my temper with you.

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:21.279
Let's promise
never to fight again, okay?

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.838
Yao, you've been busy at work lately

00:03:39.839 --> 00:03:41.439
and drinking so much every night.

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.560
I had the kitchen prepare
some tonic soup for you.

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:44.399
Drink up.

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.840
You too.

00:03:49.279 --> 00:03:50.439
Bring me another bowl.

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:55.479
You have a good appetite today.

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:56.920
You know me.

00:03:57.119 --> 00:03:58.358
Whenever I'm using my brain,

00:03:58.359 --> 00:03:59.758
I get hungry quickly.

00:03:59.759 --> 00:04:01.239
Then you better eat plenty.

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:03.558
Today's lesson isn't easy.

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:04.799
I know.

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:12.900
(Pei Residence)

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.840
Well? Did you finish the calculations?

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:26.920
Done.

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:32.760
Look at this.

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.200
It's wrong.

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:42.440
Wrong?

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:43.999
Where exactly?

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.080
Look here.

00:04:49.319 --> 00:04:52.599
You missed
last month's overdue payments.

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:58.800
Business is tough.

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.680
I don't think I'm cut out for this.

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:03.640
Every beginning is hard.

00:05:04.119 --> 00:05:05.679
You're just starting.

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.240
You've made great progress.

00:05:07.799 --> 00:05:10.598
But if you mess up,
there must be consequences.

00:05:10.599 --> 00:05:12.239
Show me your hands.

00:05:17.839 --> 00:05:19.079
No.

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:21.600
Come on, cut me some slack

00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:23.199
for trying so hard.

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:28.520
Do you think the bank cares
about your cuteness

00:05:29.359 --> 00:05:31.079
and lets you skip payments?

00:05:43.119 --> 00:05:45.919
You're ruthless and cold-blooded.

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:48.040
That's what strict teachers do
to produce masters.

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:49.640
Carry on.

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.518
Second Master, we found Wu Peirong.

00:05:55.519 --> 00:05:57.719
Our men located his body in the outskirts.

00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:59.558
Judging by the condition,

00:05:59.559 --> 00:06:01.879
he died the same night
he left the police station.

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:02.639
How did he die?

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:04.199
He was hacked to death with a knife.

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:05.679
It was brutal.

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:08.118
I think it was an act of vengeance.

00:06:08.119 --> 00:06:08.758
Oh,

00:06:08.759 --> 00:06:10.518
and I also found out Jiang Yao's people

00:06:10.519 --> 00:06:12.639
were searching for Wu Peirong too.

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:16.840
In that case,

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:19.720
let's use their own plan against them.

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:09.640
Who let you in?

00:07:09.759 --> 00:07:10.919
Get out!

00:07:12.359 --> 00:07:13.679
Yao.

00:07:23.079 --> 00:07:24.359
Xinruo...

00:07:27.839 --> 00:07:29.558
Why are you drinking so much?

00:07:29.559 --> 00:07:31.118
Are you in a bad mood?

00:07:31.119 --> 00:07:32.519
You forgive me?

00:07:36.079 --> 00:07:37.959
How could I ever blame you?

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:42.080
You'll always be the best in my heart.

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:45.840
I knew

00:07:46.599 --> 00:07:47.839
you still loved me.

00:07:50.119 --> 00:07:53.399
Yao, never leave me again.

00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:57.800
I won't leave you.

00:07:59.759 --> 00:08:01.559
We'll be together forever.

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:36.880
Xueshan?

00:10:38.199 --> 00:10:39.319
What are you doing here?

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:40.600
I...

00:10:47.799 --> 00:10:49.879
Xueshan, what happened last night...

00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:50.840
Yao.

00:10:51.839 --> 00:10:53.559
I know you didn't mean it.

00:10:54.199 --> 00:10:54.879
Let's pretend

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:56.640
last night never happened.

00:10:57.159 --> 00:10:58.479
That's not what I mean.

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:00.120
Xueshan,

00:11:00.359 --> 00:11:01.640
let's get married.

00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:04.480
Yao,

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:05.840
what did you say?

00:11:06.639 --> 00:11:08.199
I admit, I was selfish

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:09.999
and didn't consider your feelings.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.040
Once I officially become
part of the Pei family,

00:11:12.719 --> 00:11:15.079
no one will question our relationship.

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:19.360
Go wash up.

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:20.840
I still have work to finish.

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:22.278
I have to go.

00:11:22.279 --> 00:11:23.279
Go ahead.

00:11:39.359 --> 00:11:41.239
Oh, Yao,

00:11:42.159 --> 00:11:44.679
you're so eager
to be head of the family.

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:47.960
Do you really think you can use me
without paying the price?

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:51.600
The only one who can be

00:11:52.159 --> 00:11:54.199
the head of the Pei family is me.

00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:59.260
(Pei Residence)

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:04.640
I called everyone here

00:12:04.679 --> 00:12:06.359
to announce something.

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:08.160
Xueshan and I

00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:11.520
are getting married.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:17.919
Congratulations.

00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:20.560
We'll be one family soon.

00:12:20.639 --> 00:12:21.879
Thank you, Uncle Yuze.

00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:23.198
Thank you, Xinruo.

00:12:23.199 --> 00:12:24.319
Second Master!

00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:27.040
It's all right.

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:29.240
We're a family.

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:31.758
There's news about Wu Peirong.

00:12:31.759 --> 00:12:33.399
He says he wants to make a deal with you

00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:34.879
concerning an important matter.

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:35.838
What kind of deal?

00:12:35.839 --> 00:12:38.319
He wants to meet with you alone.

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:40.080
Got it.

00:12:40.239 --> 00:12:41.239
Tell him

00:12:41.319 --> 00:12:42.359
I'll be there.

00:12:42.639 --> 00:12:43.479
Yes, sir.

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:44.999
Wu Peirong is a dangerous man.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.720
You shouldn't meet him alone.

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:50.280
He just wants money.

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:51.840
He won't hurt me.

00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:53.320
I'll bring Wen Yuan along.

00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:01.678
Any updates? Did you find anything?

00:13:01.679 --> 00:13:04.039
Yes. Second Master arranged
to meet Wu Peirong at 3 PM today

00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:05.959
in an empty shop on Xijiang Road.

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:06.800
At 3 PM?

00:13:06.839 --> 00:13:08.158
Where's Pei Yuze now?

00:13:08.159 --> 00:13:10.440
He's still in the courtyard.
They said he'll leave soon.

00:13:10.639 --> 00:13:11.599
Rest assured, Master.

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:15.198
I've already sent people
to sabotage their car to delay them.

00:13:15.199 --> 00:13:16.119
Good. Let's go.

00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:17.120
Yes, sir.

00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:25.879
Wait outside.

00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:27.999
Once Wu Peirong shows up,
apprehend him immediately.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:28.960
Yes, sir.

00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:38.480
You're earlier than I expected.

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:42.238
Pei Yuze, how are you...

00:13:42.239 --> 00:13:44.079
How did I get here?

00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:46.798
I'm supposed to be stuck
in that rigged car

00:13:46.799 --> 00:13:48.719
and arrive late, right?

00:13:49.679 --> 00:13:52.959
So it was all a trap set to draw me out.

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:54.120
Pei Yuze,

00:13:54.199 --> 00:13:55.718
you're cunning.

00:13:55.719 --> 00:13:57.880
If you hadn't done
those terrible things,

00:13:57.880 --> 00:13:59.920
why would you feel guilty enough
to fall for this trap?

00:14:00.199 --> 00:14:01.959
You should just turn yourself in.

00:14:02.199 --> 00:14:03.719
I could even speak for you

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:05.358
to get a lighter sentence.

00:14:05.359 --> 00:14:07.919
What a joke! Turn myself in?

00:14:08.319 --> 00:14:09.879
I am the head of the Pei family.

00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:12.399
If I turn myself in, what would that do
to the Pei family's name?

00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:13.920
Head of the family?

00:14:14.359 --> 00:14:17.719
Your three-month pact
with Third Granduncle isn't up yet.

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:19.519
You're not the head.

00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:20.840
Pei Yuze.

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:24.040
You've always coveted the position.

00:14:24.159 --> 00:14:25.678
You pretended to be dying

00:14:25.679 --> 00:14:28.799
so Xinruo would pity you
and never leave,

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.318
and went through all that trouble
to kill Pei Yujie,

00:14:31.319 --> 00:14:32.879
all just for today.

00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:38.240
So that's why you tried to kill me.

00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:39.840
Yao,

00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:42.520
if I really wanted to be
the head of the family,

00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:44.760
do you think an outsider like you

00:14:45.239 --> 00:14:47.319
would ever have a chance?

00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:51.500
Second Master, the people outside...

00:14:51.799 --> 00:14:52.799
Go on.

00:14:59.239 --> 00:15:00.999
Release me!

00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:03.680
Let me go!
