00:00:46.046 --> 00:00:49.966
YOU AND EVERYTHING ELSE

00:00:51.885 --> 00:00:52.802
Producer Cheon.

00:00:53.511 --> 00:00:56.598
Let's touch base
in the small meeting room in ten.

00:00:57.265 --> 00:00:58.266
Okay.

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:01.311
I'm making tea. Do you want some?

00:01:01.394 --> 00:01:02.437
Sure.

00:01:14.074 --> 00:01:16.326
Ryu Eun-jung, what on earth was that?

00:01:18.203 --> 00:01:19.537
It's as you heard.

00:01:20.038 --> 00:01:21.748
We're co-producing as of today.

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:24.542
That's my girl!

00:01:26.252 --> 00:01:27.378
No biggie!

00:01:34.677 --> 00:01:36.805
I'll send over the detailed budget now.

00:01:36.888 --> 00:01:37.722
Okay.

00:01:38.848 --> 00:01:40.266
How did the meeting go?

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.310
Great, I'm feeling pretty good about it.

00:01:42.393 --> 00:01:46.231
He was so reluctant to meet,
but it went smoothly, thanks to you.

00:01:46.314 --> 00:01:47.565
That's good to hear.

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:50.193
Hey, how do you know
the writer Gang Cheol?

00:01:50.276 --> 00:01:52.028
Are you close with him?

00:01:52.112 --> 00:01:54.072
I wouldn't say we're that close.

00:01:54.572 --> 00:01:57.492
Her social skills are truly impressive.

00:01:58.201 --> 00:02:01.162
Everyone's warmed to her
except for us two.

00:02:01.246 --> 00:02:02.914
I guess she's changed.

00:02:02.997 --> 00:02:05.500
She wasn't much of a socializer back then.

00:02:05.583 --> 00:02:09.671
-Well, now she's the queen of socializing.
-Why did you give her on-set control?

00:02:10.171 --> 00:02:11.881
I didn't give her control.

00:02:12.382 --> 00:02:14.551
We'll just try this for pre-production.

00:02:15.051 --> 00:02:17.720
Director Gyeong probably feels
more comfortable with her.

00:02:18.221 --> 00:02:20.056
The budget's mine though.

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.017
Budget or whatnot, who should I report to?

00:02:23.101 --> 00:02:24.853
Both of us, obviously.

00:02:24.936 --> 00:02:27.772
You're co-producers on paper,
but one will end up as the spare.

00:02:27.856 --> 00:02:29.482
Yu-chan has a point.

00:02:29.566 --> 00:02:32.902
What matters is getting someone
powerful on your side.

00:02:32.986 --> 00:02:35.613
If the director or lead's backing you,
you're golden.

00:02:35.697 --> 00:02:37.574
I guess I'm the spare, then,

00:02:37.657 --> 00:02:39.868
since Director Gyeong
will back Producer Cheon.

00:02:40.451 --> 00:02:41.536
You've finally got it.

00:02:41.619 --> 00:02:46.416
I don't think she has. Just look at her.
Does it look like she'll give in easily?

00:02:47.834 --> 00:02:48.751
You're right.

00:02:49.252 --> 00:02:52.297
I'm reading "over my dead body."
You're back in it, Ryu Eun-jung.

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:53.298
I sure am!

00:02:53.381 --> 00:02:55.133
-That's more like it.
-No doubt.

00:02:56.593 --> 00:02:58.636
There truly is no one like Producer Ryu.

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.055
Is that right?

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:03.433
A producer handing over their project

00:03:03.516 --> 00:03:07.437
is like giving away a child
they've raised with their heart and soul.

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.190
I'm glad she went back.

00:03:10.273 --> 00:03:11.900
I'm glad she went back, too,

00:03:12.483 --> 00:03:14.235
but I bet she's sinking fast.

00:03:15.361 --> 00:03:17.530
Did you hear Gyeong's directing Good Man?

00:03:18.198 --> 00:03:19.032
No.

00:03:19.115 --> 00:03:23.411
He practically forced her to co-produce
with someone named Cheon Sang-yeon.

00:03:24.871 --> 00:03:25.872
Cheon Sang-yeon?

00:03:26.998 --> 00:03:29.709
Do you know why
Gyeong Seung-ju brought her over?

00:03:33.004 --> 00:03:34.005
They're together.

00:03:37.008 --> 00:03:38.551
Weren't you two friends?

00:03:38.635 --> 00:03:40.845
How do you not know? Everyone knows.

00:03:40.929 --> 00:03:44.891
They were holding hands and whatnot
at the Venice Film Festival two years ago.

00:03:44.974 --> 00:03:46.935
What an absolute hypocrite.

00:03:47.018 --> 00:03:48.645
In every acceptance speech,

00:03:48.728 --> 00:03:51.731
he always says he loves his wife
and thanks her,

00:03:52.273 --> 00:03:53.566
all while sneaking around.

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:54.567
Yeah, I'll say.

00:03:58.029 --> 00:03:58.863
No way.

00:04:02.992 --> 00:04:04.118
Where is Jong-su?

00:04:04.911 --> 00:04:06.537
He stepped out for coffee beans.

00:04:07.121 --> 00:04:09.916
Why did you call me here
when you'll be leaving in ten?

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.336
Lim Ju-ho is joining
Choi Jang-hun's project.

00:04:14.003 --> 00:04:15.421
As his cinematographer?

00:04:16.256 --> 00:04:17.674
I thought he refused…

00:04:17.757 --> 00:04:18.675
Apparently not.

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.389
Mr. Jeong suggested Shin Gyu-min.

00:04:26.266 --> 00:04:27.517
Shin Gyu-min, really?

00:04:28.643 --> 00:04:29.644
Or Kim Sang-hak.

00:04:31.938 --> 00:04:34.315
He was originally lined up
for cinematography.

00:04:35.191 --> 00:04:36.276
For Good Man?

00:04:36.359 --> 00:04:37.193
Yes.

00:04:37.694 --> 00:04:40.238
He actually draws his own storyboards.

00:04:40.822 --> 00:04:43.992
Mr. Jeong shared this with me,
and it's not half bad.

00:04:46.536 --> 00:04:48.413
Let's continue searching.

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:50.456
Why?

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.500
I figured you'd say yes for sure.

00:04:52.583 --> 00:04:54.836
Didn't you like
Wasteland's cinematography?

00:04:59.132 --> 00:05:00.258
What is it?

00:05:00.925 --> 00:05:02.802
Spill it. I'm sensing something here.

00:05:04.178 --> 00:05:06.681
He's an upperclassman
from my university photography club.

00:05:08.224 --> 00:05:09.475
Was he not a good guy?

00:05:09.559 --> 00:05:13.062
Not at all. Even back then,
you could see he had talent.

00:05:13.813 --> 00:05:15.440
Then what's the problem?

00:05:20.403 --> 00:05:22.864
Let's just take more time
with the decision.

00:05:26.993 --> 00:05:29.620
Why are you looking at me
like you know everything?

00:05:30.788 --> 00:05:32.290
I do know a thing or two about you.

00:05:33.416 --> 00:05:34.375
Like what?

00:05:35.376 --> 00:05:38.421
You acting like this has people talking.

00:05:38.921 --> 00:05:39.881
Talking how?

00:05:39.964 --> 00:05:41.215
They say we're dating.

00:05:42.508 --> 00:05:43.926
They're not wrong, are they?

00:05:44.844 --> 00:05:46.596
You know what I mean.

00:05:47.555 --> 00:05:49.766
Dating is for people
who share romantic feelings.

00:05:50.516 --> 00:05:52.685
All we did was sleep together once.

00:05:55.563 --> 00:05:57.523
Give me one more day to find someone.

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:00.401
You should get going.

00:06:02.028 --> 00:06:02.904
Okay.

00:06:05.114 --> 00:06:07.950
I'll be tweaking the script
for the next week or so.

00:06:08.951 --> 00:06:11.454
Nothing major.
I just want to make a few edits.

00:06:13.122 --> 00:06:14.457
Of course, as you should.

00:06:21.672 --> 00:06:24.884
Since when have you two worked together?

00:06:27.678 --> 00:06:29.055
When did we first meet?

00:06:29.806 --> 00:06:30.890
When you were 22?

00:06:31.808 --> 00:06:33.267
In the winter of 2003.

00:06:34.102 --> 00:06:37.480
I was an assistant director
on this film set in winter,

00:06:37.563 --> 00:06:39.607
but there was no sign of snow.

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:42.443
Right. CGI back then
was nothing like today's.

00:06:42.527 --> 00:06:43.945
We sprinkled salt for snow.

00:06:44.028 --> 00:06:46.823
We hired four part-timers to do just that,

00:06:46.906 --> 00:06:50.493
and one impressed me so much
that I recommended her to the studio.

00:06:51.869 --> 00:06:53.037
What about school…

00:06:53.788 --> 00:06:54.872
I dropped out.

00:06:56.332 --> 00:06:58.501
Didn't you hear? I didn't graduate.

00:07:00.545 --> 00:07:01.879
I had no idea.

00:07:01.963 --> 00:07:04.924
In other words,
Producer Cheon learned the ropes on set.

00:07:07.927 --> 00:07:10.847
For cinematography, I plan to meet
Director Kim Sang-hak first.

00:07:13.141 --> 00:07:16.394
I thought you were going with
Director Lim Ju-ho.

00:07:16.978 --> 00:07:18.688
He joined Choi Jang-hun's movie.

00:07:19.188 --> 00:07:22.400
Producer Cheon tells me
his talent was clear even in university.

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:23.985
Hold up.

00:07:24.068 --> 00:07:25.570
Do you know Kim Sang-hak?

00:07:26.237 --> 00:07:28.322
You could say that, I guess.

00:07:30.074 --> 00:07:31.659
Is this what they call fate?

00:07:31.742 --> 00:07:34.120
It seems this project was meant for him.

00:07:34.203 --> 00:07:37.665
You should arrange a meeting with him
before he joins something else.

00:07:39.709 --> 00:07:40.710
Will do, sir.

00:07:52.638 --> 00:07:53.806
I really

00:07:54.724 --> 00:07:56.225
didn't feel like doing this.

00:07:57.977 --> 00:07:59.395
Director Gyeong Seung-ju?

00:08:00.605 --> 00:08:02.815
He seems keen to work with you.

00:08:02.899 --> 00:08:05.067
In any case, he wants to meet you.

00:08:05.735 --> 00:08:08.404
He is available any day except Mondays.

00:08:08.488 --> 00:08:10.156
When might work for you, seonbae?

00:08:13.409 --> 00:08:17.872
He practically forced her to co-produce
with someone named Cheon Sang-yeon.

00:08:23.377 --> 00:08:25.338
I think I'll have to say no.

00:08:27.131 --> 00:08:28.633
I'd like some time off.

00:08:29.258 --> 00:08:31.886
Please explain to the director for me.

00:08:42.396 --> 00:08:43.397
I will.

00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:46.192
Let's work together next time.

00:08:46.901 --> 00:08:47.735
Sure.

00:08:49.904 --> 00:08:51.030
I'm really sorry

00:08:52.698 --> 00:08:54.492
about how this project turned out.

00:08:54.575 --> 00:08:56.077
No, don't worry about it.

00:08:57.495 --> 00:08:58.329
But

00:08:59.705 --> 00:09:02.959
now that you've dropped the whole
"Director Kim," can you talk casually?

00:09:05.545 --> 00:09:08.965
I want this to feel comfortable.
Like we're friends.

00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:10.716
Like I'm your seonbae.

00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:15.721
I don't know about friends,

00:09:16.347 --> 00:09:19.183
but I guess you are my seonbae,
Director Kim.

00:09:20.351 --> 00:09:23.354
Wait, pretend I didn't just call you that.

00:09:29.026 --> 00:09:30.820
Why is he playing so hard to get?

00:09:31.946 --> 00:09:33.489
I'll find someone else.

00:09:34.615 --> 00:09:36.742
Forget it. Just tell him to show up.

00:09:37.577 --> 00:09:39.870
It's up to Gyeong Seung-ju
to sweeten him up.

00:09:40.871 --> 00:09:44.292
If we can't even set up a meeting,
what will Gyeong think of me?

00:09:46.294 --> 00:09:47.378
Will do, sir.

00:09:51.674 --> 00:09:54.176
If you're free, can we discuss the budget?

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.387
Wait in the meeting room.
I need to make a call.

00:10:07.732 --> 00:10:10.484
The number you have dialed
is currently unavailable--

00:10:14.822 --> 00:10:16.949
I hear seonbae is reluctant to meet.

00:10:18.951 --> 00:10:19.785
Why?

00:10:20.369 --> 00:10:21.954
Is he shooting something else?

00:10:24.165 --> 00:10:26.626
No, he just wants some time off.

00:10:26.709 --> 00:10:29.879
He just wants a break?
Are you sure it's not about me?

00:10:42.266 --> 00:10:43.476
Do you really want him

00:10:44.602 --> 00:10:46.771
to sign on as our cinematographer?

00:10:49.357 --> 00:10:50.191
Yes.

00:10:50.941 --> 00:10:52.026
He's good.

00:10:54.236 --> 00:10:56.447
Do you let your personal feelings
affect your work?

00:11:00.993 --> 00:11:02.787
What did you want to ask about the budget?

00:11:10.878 --> 00:11:12.880
Is this your first budget plan?

00:11:18.386 --> 00:11:19.970
Why? Is there a problem?

00:11:20.054 --> 00:11:21.180
Not just a problem.

00:11:21.263 --> 00:11:25.685
Even if the director switch means changes,
you've missed too many items.

00:11:25.768 --> 00:11:30.064
Did you look into the equipment, labor,
and VFX costs before budgeting?

00:11:33.734 --> 00:11:34.944
I didn't get quotes,

00:11:35.027 --> 00:11:37.863
but I referenced the budgets
for Rescue and The Titans--

00:11:37.947 --> 00:11:41.033
Rescue was released last year.
The Titans, the year before.

00:11:41.909 --> 00:11:43.953
Costs have skyrocketed since then.

00:11:44.036 --> 00:11:47.957
Plus, estimated costs
for set miniatures and voice actors

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:50.334
were entirely missing
from special effects.

00:12:02.972 --> 00:12:04.056
You're right.

00:12:07.435 --> 00:12:09.937
I've never handled
such a large budget before.

00:12:12.231 --> 00:12:14.942
If anything else is missing,
please let me know now.

00:12:15.025 --> 00:12:17.987
You've put down two cars
for the explosion scene--

00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:18.904
But we need three?

00:12:18.988 --> 00:12:20.823
No, four.

00:12:21.991 --> 00:12:25.578
Do you really think we can shoot
a car explosion in a single take?

00:12:25.661 --> 00:12:28.330
There are so many variables
for a scene this big.

00:12:28.414 --> 00:12:29.915
We need to be prepared.

00:12:29.999 --> 00:12:32.585
We need three cars for the explosion.
Four in total.

00:12:33.085 --> 00:12:36.589
It also looks like you considered
Aspect as our VFX partner,

00:12:36.672 --> 00:12:38.215
but that's not a smart idea…

00:12:50.936 --> 00:12:52.646
It's not like I hadn't tried.

00:12:54.732 --> 00:12:57.276
I had spent a whole week on that budget.

00:13:01.655 --> 00:13:02.656
Is it really

00:13:04.241 --> 00:13:06.410
impossible for me to ever beat you?

00:13:14.502 --> 00:13:16.003
CINEMATOGRAPHER KIM SANG-HAK

00:13:19.548 --> 00:13:20.841
Hey, seonbae.

00:13:24.136 --> 00:13:24.970
Yes.

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:28.557
A meeting?

00:13:30.226 --> 00:13:32.436
I'd appreciate it if you could come.

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:34.980
Just think of it as a casual meal.

00:13:35.064 --> 00:13:37.191
You don't have to take on the project.

00:13:38.192 --> 00:13:40.528
Would you be in a bind if I say no?

00:13:42.446 --> 00:13:43.489
A little,

00:13:44.281 --> 00:13:45.282
yes.

00:13:47.743 --> 00:13:48.911
I can do Tuesday.

00:13:49.495 --> 00:13:50.746
Great, thanks.

00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:53.165
I'll text you
once the location is confirmed.

00:13:53.749 --> 00:13:54.583
Okay.

00:13:54.667 --> 00:13:58.045
By the way, Sang-yeon will be there too.

00:13:59.129 --> 00:14:00.965
I just thought you should know.

00:14:01.048 --> 00:14:03.717
I know.
I heard about you co-producing with her.

00:14:05.052 --> 00:14:06.512
Director Ju told me.

00:14:10.057 --> 00:14:11.058
I see.

00:14:14.770 --> 00:14:16.105
See you Tuesday, then.

00:14:34.123 --> 00:14:34.957
You're here.

00:14:38.210 --> 00:14:39.753
I thought I'd be early.

00:14:39.837 --> 00:14:40.921
There was no traffic.

00:14:41.005 --> 00:14:44.049
-I'm Gyeong Seung-ju. A pleasure.
-Hello, I'm Kim Sang-hak.

00:14:45.634 --> 00:14:47.595
It's been a while, seonbae.

00:14:49.013 --> 00:14:50.139
It's been a minute.

00:14:50.848 --> 00:14:52.057
-Let's sit.
-Sure.

00:14:56.645 --> 00:14:58.731
I hear you two were in the same club.

00:14:58.814 --> 00:14:59.648
Right, yes.

00:15:00.649 --> 00:15:02.818
So was Producer Ryu Eun-jung.

00:15:02.902 --> 00:15:03.777
Is that true?

00:15:05.195 --> 00:15:06.363
So you all know each other?

00:15:11.327 --> 00:15:14.622
I wonder
how Producer Ryu's meeting is going.

00:15:16.206 --> 00:15:17.833
He turned down the job.

00:15:17.917 --> 00:15:20.461
Why did Mr. Jeong
insist on arranging a meeting?

00:15:21.629 --> 00:15:23.547
You don't want him
to take the job, do you?

00:15:23.631 --> 00:15:24.465
Me?

00:15:24.548 --> 00:15:25.466
Yes, you.

00:15:25.549 --> 00:15:26.467
Nonsense.

00:15:28.844 --> 00:15:30.888
Make your move while you can.

00:15:30.971 --> 00:15:33.432
You’ll regret it if you just sit around.

00:15:33.515 --> 00:15:34.600
Regret, my foot.

00:15:42.816 --> 00:15:45.277
I enjoyed Wasteland.
The cinematography was great.

00:15:45.361 --> 00:15:46.403
Thank you.

00:15:47.613 --> 00:15:50.658
I saw the storyboard too.
I heard you drew it yourself.

00:15:51.659 --> 00:15:54.620
I'm not much of an artist,
but that's just how I work.

00:15:54.703 --> 00:15:56.747
I have many questions,
but let's start here.

00:15:56.830 --> 00:15:59.750
How did you shoot
that long-take car chase scene?

00:16:00.501 --> 00:16:05.005
I rewatched that scene five times,
but I just couldn't figure it out.

00:16:05.089 --> 00:16:07.091
-It differed from the storyboard.
-Yes.

00:16:07.174 --> 00:16:11.303
From the beginning, the director wanted
that scene to be one continuous take.

00:16:11.387 --> 00:16:12.513
As did I.

00:16:12.596 --> 00:16:14.765
When it came to the storyboard,

00:16:14.848 --> 00:16:18.602
I had cut it into several shots
because I couldn't think of another way.

00:16:18.686 --> 00:16:19.520
But?

00:16:20.771 --> 00:16:23.482
Sang-yeon's eyes were fixed on him,

00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:27.611
as though the rest of the world
had gone silent.

00:16:28.737 --> 00:16:30.864
So I searched for ways
we could make it happen.

00:16:30.948 --> 00:16:32.408
But the issue was

00:16:32.908 --> 00:16:37.079
the car was too tight for us
to fit the camera.

00:16:37.162 --> 00:16:38.706
So you tore off the car roof?

00:16:38.789 --> 00:16:39.790
Exactly.

00:16:43.002 --> 00:16:44.753
Looks like I found my guy.

00:16:46.296 --> 00:16:47.506
Excited to work with you.

00:16:50.134 --> 00:16:51.093
Director Gyeong.

00:16:57.474 --> 00:16:59.268
Why did you refuse the offer?

00:17:01.854 --> 00:17:02.938
It's as I said.

00:17:04.064 --> 00:17:06.817
I’m a little worn out
after what happened to Director Lee.

00:17:07.943 --> 00:17:10.154
You said yes to Director Ju.

00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:12.322
That was…

00:17:14.867 --> 00:17:15.951
because…

00:17:16.035 --> 00:17:18.287
The script was just that good.

00:17:23.834 --> 00:17:24.918
Does Sang-yeon

00:17:26.336 --> 00:17:27.713
make you uncomfortable?

00:17:30.883 --> 00:17:32.176
I'd say it's not easy.

00:17:33.594 --> 00:17:36.180
But this isn't necessarily
about Sang-yeon.

00:17:36.722 --> 00:17:37.973
Just the whole situation…

00:17:40.893 --> 00:17:42.186
Will you get a cab?

00:17:42.269 --> 00:17:43.395
Yes, you?

00:17:44.396 --> 00:17:45.355
The bus.

00:17:45.439 --> 00:17:47.900
Let’s walk.
I’ll catch a cab at the bus stop.

00:17:51.862 --> 00:17:53.280
I just don't understand.

00:17:56.700 --> 00:17:58.118
What happened to Director Lee--

00:17:58.202 --> 00:18:00.037
But he said yes to Ju Dong-hyang.

00:18:02.414 --> 00:18:03.582
Is that even a reason?

00:18:06.418 --> 00:18:08.962
It can't be a reason
because it just isn't.

00:18:12.591 --> 00:18:14.384
Oh? It's Yu-chan.

00:18:20.599 --> 00:18:21.433
Did you work late?

00:18:21.517 --> 00:18:22.518
Yes.

00:18:25.646 --> 00:18:27.773
This is Cinematographer Kim Sang-hak.

00:18:27.856 --> 00:18:30.400
Nice to meet you.
I'm Song Yu-chan from JD Entertainment.

00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:33.445
Nice to meet you too. I'm Kim Sang-hak.

00:18:38.659 --> 00:18:40.744
That's an awfully long handshake.

00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:44.164
-How are you getting home?
-A cab.

00:18:45.541 --> 00:18:48.043
There's one. Taxi!

00:18:51.338 --> 00:18:52.589
Well, take care.

00:18:53.382 --> 00:18:54.258
Thank you.

00:18:55.092 --> 00:18:56.218
I'll go. Get home safe.

00:18:56.301 --> 00:18:59.596
Don't you worry. I’ll make sure
Producer Ryu gets home safe.

00:19:10.482 --> 00:19:11.358
What was that?

00:19:11.859 --> 00:19:12.860
You heard me.

00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:17.614
Get in.

00:19:19.616 --> 00:19:21.869
Why are you acting so strange?

00:19:22.452 --> 00:19:24.580
Mok-dong intersection, please.

00:19:30.794 --> 00:19:32.754
Yu-chan drove you home?

00:19:33.255 --> 00:19:34.840
He's such an oddball.

00:19:34.923 --> 00:19:38.552
-He wanted to cruise the Jayu Motorway.
-He felt like doing what?

00:19:39.052 --> 00:19:40.554
Did he work late yesterday?

00:19:41.054 --> 00:19:41.972
Here he comes.

00:19:42.055 --> 00:19:43.807
Ask him yourself. I'm off.

00:19:44.308 --> 00:19:46.435
-Hi.
-I'm off too.

00:19:46.518 --> 00:19:47.853
Where to? I just got here.

00:19:47.936 --> 00:19:49.313
I have budgeting to do.

00:19:49.396 --> 00:19:51.481
Still? Aren't you going out for a smoke?

00:19:51.982 --> 00:19:53.192
Well, I am.

00:19:53.275 --> 00:19:55.819
How about you and I have
a little rooftop rendezvous?

00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:57.154
Come.

00:19:57.237 --> 00:19:58.655
Okay, but just for today.

00:20:03.327 --> 00:20:07.331
Director Gyeong
genuinely wants to work with you.

00:20:08.207 --> 00:20:10.667
He's even more keen
after meeting you in person.

00:20:16.632 --> 00:20:19.968
Director Gyeong Seung-ju
is a decent director.

00:20:20.052 --> 00:20:21.386
He's very open-minded.

00:20:22.471 --> 00:20:24.431
I think you two will get on well.

00:20:25.182 --> 00:20:28.060
I’m sorry you made the trip here
for nothing.

00:20:35.484 --> 00:20:36.610
Is it

00:20:38.028 --> 00:20:39.154
because of me?

00:20:41.073 --> 00:20:42.491
Do I make you uncomfortable?

00:20:44.493 --> 00:20:47.287
Don't try to deny it.
I'm the only thing that's changed.

00:20:48.789 --> 00:20:51.041
If that’s the case,
you won't have to worry.

00:20:52.125 --> 00:20:55.295
I'll make myself scarce
while you focus on your work.

00:20:55.379 --> 00:20:57.089
Why would you have to?

00:20:58.173 --> 00:20:59.383
It's not like that.

00:20:59.883 --> 00:21:02.386
Please pass on my thanks
to Director Gyeong.

00:21:02.469 --> 00:21:04.096
Maybe next time.

00:21:06.556 --> 00:21:07.391
Seonbae.

00:21:07.474 --> 00:21:09.434
I have somewhere to be, so I'll get going.

00:21:12.271 --> 00:21:13.522
Good luck with the movie.

00:21:32.749 --> 00:21:36.586
WASTELAND
STORYBOARD BOOK

00:21:43.302 --> 00:21:46.763
Just how worn out can he be?
Are you sure it's a no?

00:21:47.764 --> 00:21:50.183
I guess we'll have to go
with Shin Gyu-min.

00:21:50.267 --> 00:21:52.185
I'll discuss it with Director Gyeong.

00:21:52.269 --> 00:21:53.478
Nothing comes easy.

00:21:54.313 --> 00:21:56.940
Kids these days have some nerve.

00:21:57.607 --> 00:22:01.194
Isn't he worried about
getting on the wrong side of JD?

00:22:04.865 --> 00:22:07.117
-See you tomorrow.
-See you tomorrow.

00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:09.077
-Goodbye.
-Good work today.

00:22:09.870 --> 00:22:11.663
Shin Gyu-min.

00:22:15.625 --> 00:22:17.127
You can leave that there.

00:22:18.628 --> 00:22:19.629
See you tomorrow.

00:22:36.938 --> 00:22:39.858
I had high hopes for that scene myself,

00:22:39.941 --> 00:22:44.196
and ultimately, it's my job
to bring the director's vision to life.

00:22:44.279 --> 00:22:47.032
So I searched for ways
we could make it happen.

00:23:16.311 --> 00:23:20.148
What's so hard to say?
Didn't you come here to say something?

00:23:26.655 --> 00:23:28.365
Let's work on the movie together.

00:23:31.993 --> 00:23:34.121
I saw your storyboard for Wasteland.

00:23:35.622 --> 00:23:36.706
Above all,

00:23:37.916 --> 00:23:39.835
I want to make Good Man a good film.

00:23:40.502 --> 00:23:44.673
I'm certain that no one can capture
its essence as brilliantly as you.

00:23:45.465 --> 00:23:47.551
I know you want some time off,

00:23:47.634 --> 00:23:50.512
and I know it must be awkward
seeing Sang-yeon and me.

00:23:51.346 --> 00:23:54.975
But still, I'd really like you
to take on this project.

00:23:58.728 --> 00:23:59.563
Okay, then.

00:24:05.277 --> 00:24:07.070
Why? Don't you want that?

00:24:09.823 --> 00:24:10.657
I do.

00:24:14.453 --> 00:24:16.872
I'll give it my best, Producer Ryu.

00:24:36.808 --> 00:24:39.186
Seonbae agreed to sign on
for cinematography.

00:24:51.072 --> 00:24:53.325
As expected of Cheon Sang-yeon.

00:24:53.408 --> 00:24:55.785
Second to none at convincing people.

00:24:56.286 --> 00:24:58.497
It wasn't me. It was Producer Ryu.

00:24:58.580 --> 00:25:00.373
Really? Why didn't you talk to him?

00:25:02.375 --> 00:25:04.586
I tried, but he wouldn't budge.

00:25:06.671 --> 00:25:09.966
Back in the day,
was Ryu Eun-jung closer to Kim Sang-hak?

00:25:13.261 --> 00:25:14.888
Where shall we storyboard?

00:25:15.597 --> 00:25:16.515
So it's a yes.

00:25:17.098 --> 00:25:18.558
We don't have time to waste--

00:25:18.642 --> 00:25:21.561
At the office, of course.
That ought to stir up some fun.

00:25:23.230 --> 00:25:25.357
When shall we do the script meeting?

00:25:34.491 --> 00:25:35.534
Is it that bad?

00:25:37.369 --> 00:25:40.622
Director Gyeong seems to think
we're making an action film.

00:25:43.792 --> 00:25:45.460
Why are you going through it again?

00:25:47.003 --> 00:25:49.381
It's lunchtime. Let's go eat.

00:25:52.425 --> 00:25:53.343
Come on.

00:25:58.974 --> 00:26:00.308
This is hitting the spot.

00:26:04.396 --> 00:26:06.731
What's got you so deep in thought
over your meal?

00:26:06.815 --> 00:26:08.358
Her script meeting is at 2:00.

00:26:08.942 --> 00:26:11.695
Man, she's impossible.
She thinks she's a writer.

00:26:23.039 --> 00:26:26.876
GOOD MAN
PRODUCTION OFFICE

00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:27.961
Come on in.

00:26:28.044 --> 00:26:29.296
Hello.

00:26:29.379 --> 00:26:31.548
I heard that you convinced Director Kim.

00:26:31.631 --> 00:26:32.716
Good job.

00:26:32.799 --> 00:26:33.842
It's nothing.

00:26:35.218 --> 00:26:37.512
What were your thoughts on the script?

00:26:37.596 --> 00:26:40.599
I like how the script feels
more dynamic and fast-paced.

00:26:40.682 --> 00:26:41.683
No edits to suggest?

00:26:41.766 --> 00:26:42.767
None at all.

00:26:43.518 --> 00:26:44.728
Producer Ryu?

00:26:44.811 --> 00:26:48.356
I agree that the action scenes
are much more engaging now.

00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:51.735
However, among the scenes you deleted,

00:26:51.818 --> 00:26:54.988
I think we should reconsider including

00:26:55.488 --> 00:26:57.824
the latter parts of scene 45 and scene 72.

00:26:59.826 --> 00:27:00.994
Scene 45?

00:27:01.953 --> 00:27:03.997
Scene 45…

00:27:05.332 --> 00:27:07.334
It slows down the overall plot.

00:27:08.168 --> 00:27:09.502
I have to agree.

00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:12.005
Without that scene,

00:27:12.088 --> 00:27:14.507
I don't think audiences will be convinced

00:27:14.591 --> 00:27:18.386
about why Su-jin defies her superior
and chooses to side with Tae-o.

00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:22.057
Why wouldn't they?

00:27:22.557 --> 00:27:24.476
I find it perfectly convincing.

00:27:24.559 --> 00:27:27.479
How will we clarify
that Su-jin is actually Gyeong-eun

00:27:27.562 --> 00:27:31.149
and that she and Tae-o grew up
relying on each other at the orphanage?

00:27:31.232 --> 00:27:32.651
That crap's unimportant.

00:27:41.951 --> 00:27:43.078
What is important, then?

00:27:43.161 --> 00:27:46.164
What truly matters
is how they get revenge on K.

00:27:46.247 --> 00:27:49.542
Audiences won't care
whether they knew each other in the past.

00:27:58.885 --> 00:28:03.348
I believe it's the emotions films evoke
that stay with the audience.

00:28:04.057 --> 00:28:07.602
Whether it’s laughter,
tears, catharsis, or fear,

00:28:07.686 --> 00:28:09.771
audiences feel
these emotions vicariously--

00:28:09.854 --> 00:28:13.566
As long as there's a hint of plausibility,
audiences connect with a protagonist.

00:28:13.650 --> 00:28:16.277
No, emotions need room to develop.

00:28:16.861 --> 00:28:20.573
Take Titanic, when DiCaprio sacrifices
himself to save Kate Winslet.

00:28:20.657 --> 00:28:23.827
That moment would be moving
even if they were strangers

00:28:23.910 --> 00:28:26.246
as it demonstrates an act of selflessness.

00:28:26.329 --> 00:28:29.624
However, the reason
that scene resonates so deeply

00:28:29.708 --> 00:28:32.502
is that we've witnessed
their love story unfold.

00:28:33.002 --> 00:28:34.003
That's a romance--

00:28:34.087 --> 00:28:36.840
By your definition,
Titanic should be a disaster film.

00:28:41.428 --> 00:28:43.722
I think this scene is no different.

00:28:43.805 --> 00:28:47.976
Think about Su-jin's immense sorrow
when Tae-o dies at the end.

00:28:50.687 --> 00:28:53.690
Do you truly think
this scene isn't crucial to that?

00:28:57.152 --> 00:28:59.529
Even if we film this scene, it'll get cut.

00:29:00.613 --> 00:29:02.407
I was just sharing my opinion.

00:29:02.490 --> 00:29:04.784
The final decision
lies with you, Director.

00:29:07.328 --> 00:29:09.122
Is it now my turn to speak?

00:29:11.291 --> 00:29:13.126
Let's follow Producer Ryu's suggestion.

00:29:13.209 --> 00:29:14.711
What was the other scene?

00:29:16.212 --> 00:29:17.505
Scene 72.

00:29:18.089 --> 00:29:19.174
Scene 72?

00:29:26.139 --> 00:29:27.515
I can finally breathe.

00:29:28.391 --> 00:29:29.934
You're the best.

00:29:30.018 --> 00:29:32.228
I so needed a pick-me-up after that.

00:29:33.730 --> 00:29:35.857
Things seemed tense,
but looks like you won.

00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:39.110
This isn't boxing.
There are no winners or losers.

00:29:39.194 --> 00:29:42.322
Turns out Gyeong Seung-ju isn't half bad.

00:29:42.405 --> 00:29:44.866
He's easy-going and catches on fast.

00:29:45.450 --> 00:29:46.910
She's smart, that one.

00:29:47.410 --> 00:29:49.829
Which explains why
Mr. Jeong was set on keeping her.

00:29:49.913 --> 00:29:53.958
Why did you do that earlier?
You clearly agreed with her point.

00:29:55.919 --> 00:29:57.670
I thought my point was stronger.

00:29:57.754 --> 00:30:00.799
Did you two have a fight?
Or have you always been rivals?

00:30:01.299 --> 00:30:03.218
Tomorrow's storyboard meeting is at 1:00.

00:30:09.349 --> 00:30:10.850
What's your asking price?

00:30:12.143 --> 00:30:13.186
The higher, the better.

00:30:14.354 --> 00:30:15.647
Say your price.

00:30:16.147 --> 00:30:17.649
You tell me yours first.

00:30:20.276 --> 00:30:23.154
Well, according to the JD base contract,

00:30:23.238 --> 00:30:25.031
you've done one low-budget feature…

00:30:26.574 --> 00:30:28.159
Am I intruding?

00:30:29.244 --> 00:30:31.079
Are you disappointed that I'm here?

00:30:31.746 --> 00:30:32.580
Not at all.

00:30:32.664 --> 00:30:33.998
Don't worry about her.

00:30:34.499 --> 00:30:37.585
She's just teasing because she knows
we went to the same university.

00:30:37.669 --> 00:30:39.045
Do you have a girlfriend?

00:30:42.382 --> 00:30:43.633
No, I don't.

00:30:44.509 --> 00:30:47.095
I guess everyone here
is single apart from me.

00:30:53.309 --> 00:30:54.936
Director Kim, you're early.

00:30:55.019 --> 00:30:56.521
I needed to discuss my contract.

00:30:56.604 --> 00:30:59.858
Did you manage to strike a good deal?
Negotiating is my forte.

00:31:01.025 --> 00:31:02.944
-See you after lunch.
-Enjoy your meal.

00:31:03.027 --> 00:31:04.195
Enjoy your lunch.

00:31:09.117 --> 00:31:11.744
Does that mean you have a boyfriend,
Producer Oh?

00:31:11.828 --> 00:31:14.789
He's a pretty famous director
in the indie film scene.

00:31:14.873 --> 00:31:16.040
I'll have ox knee soup.

00:31:16.541 --> 00:31:19.043
But nobody would know him around here.

00:31:19.127 --> 00:31:22.338
Cinematographers are an exception
since they earn good money.

00:31:24.424 --> 00:31:26.843
Why do his films
all have to be experimental?

00:31:32.098 --> 00:31:34.100
Why didn't you wait in my office?

00:31:34.183 --> 00:31:35.059
It's fine.

00:31:35.143 --> 00:31:37.145
Let me introduce you two.

00:31:37.228 --> 00:31:39.272
This is our cinematographer, Kim Sang-hak.

00:31:39.355 --> 00:31:41.649
Producer Song here
will be managing things on set.

00:31:43.026 --> 00:31:44.777
I look forward to working with you.

00:31:45.445 --> 00:31:47.238
Likewise, Producer Song.

00:31:48.781 --> 00:31:49.657
Let's go.

00:32:00.126 --> 00:32:01.878
The storyboard's done?

00:32:02.378 --> 00:32:05.632
I just sketched what came to mind
for the opening scene.

00:32:14.682 --> 00:32:15.767
I like this idea.

00:32:37.664 --> 00:32:39.207
Meet me on the rooftop.

00:32:48.675 --> 00:32:50.677
I'm really busy, you know.

00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:51.928
Ryu Eun-jung.

00:32:52.428 --> 00:32:53.513
I like you.

00:32:58.017 --> 00:32:58.851
Are you insane?

00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:01.104
This is… We're at work.

00:33:01.187 --> 00:33:03.606
I don't care if we are. I mean it.

00:33:05.108 --> 00:33:06.109
I've liked you…

00:33:09.112 --> 00:33:10.321
for a long time now.

00:33:13.533 --> 00:33:14.617
You're crazy.

00:33:20.957 --> 00:33:23.626
We should finalize everything
before sharing this.

00:33:23.710 --> 00:33:24.544
Okay.

00:33:54.782 --> 00:33:55.742
Hey.

00:33:55.825 --> 00:33:57.744
Thanks for the fair contract for my crew.

00:33:58.244 --> 00:34:00.663
Nonsense. It was a tough negotiation.

00:34:04.959 --> 00:34:06.919
Wow, the cinematographer…

00:34:07.003 --> 00:34:08.212
What? Is he bad?

00:34:08.296 --> 00:34:10.548
He brings fresh ideas every day.

00:34:10.631 --> 00:34:13.051
Most directors could get a free ride
on his expertise.

00:34:13.134 --> 00:34:16.137
He's that impressive?
How far is he into the script?

00:34:16.637 --> 00:34:18.264
One-third of the script, was it?

00:34:18.765 --> 00:34:19.640
Yes.

00:34:19.724 --> 00:34:21.392
Yikes, that's fast.

00:34:22.060 --> 00:34:23.061
Can I get a preview?

00:34:23.144 --> 00:34:25.563
Not a chance.
You can take a look when we're done.

00:34:34.405 --> 00:34:35.531
Hand it over.

00:34:36.115 --> 00:34:37.241
Where's Director Gyeong?

00:34:37.325 --> 00:34:39.077
Having dinner with the art director.

00:34:42.580 --> 00:34:44.540
He told me not to show anyone.

00:34:44.624 --> 00:34:46.209
I'm your team leader, you punk.

00:34:47.668 --> 00:34:49.921
I'll keep this a secret. I swear.

00:34:50.004 --> 00:34:51.964
You can't tell anyone, seriously.

00:35:02.642 --> 00:35:05.394
May I have a sneak peek too?

00:35:07.855 --> 00:35:08.689
I won't tell.

00:35:44.183 --> 00:35:45.893
How come you're just leaving?

00:35:45.977 --> 00:35:49.689
I was meeting Director Lee Chan-seok.
Get in. I'll drive you home.

00:35:50.773 --> 00:35:52.024
Did you call a car service?

00:35:52.108 --> 00:35:54.068
Yes, they'll come to the parking lot.

00:35:58.948 --> 00:36:00.908
Isn't that Director Kim and Producer Ryu?

00:36:05.037 --> 00:36:06.289
Are they involved?

00:36:09.709 --> 00:36:11.335
They dated in the past.

00:36:13.296 --> 00:36:14.922
Producer Ryu and Director Kim?

00:36:15.464 --> 00:36:16.299
Yes.

00:36:16.883 --> 00:36:18.134
The club's official couple.

00:36:18.885 --> 00:36:21.220
-And you were pushed out?
-Yes.

00:36:22.555 --> 00:36:23.764
It was one-sided.

00:36:25.474 --> 00:36:26.517
Really?

00:36:27.643 --> 00:36:28.477
Really.

00:36:29.937 --> 00:36:31.939
Why didn't you tell him how you felt?

00:36:32.023 --> 00:36:34.734
I did. Though it was a bit indirect.

00:36:34.817 --> 00:36:38.279
And he still said no?
Because of someone like Ryu Eun-jung?

00:36:40.364 --> 00:36:42.408
You don't know Eun-jung.

00:36:44.285 --> 00:36:46.412
To this day, I have never beaten her.

00:36:48.789 --> 00:36:50.041
Do you always go home late?

00:36:51.250 --> 00:36:52.168
Sometimes.

00:36:53.753 --> 00:36:56.255
I'm glad you weren't stubborn
about taking the bus.

00:36:56.839 --> 00:36:59.926
Why would I be stubborn about that?
I'm always eager for a comfortable ride.

00:37:03.054 --> 00:37:04.138
You seem upbeat.

00:37:04.847 --> 00:37:06.390
Did something good happen?

00:37:06.474 --> 00:37:08.517
Yes, something great.

00:37:08.601 --> 00:37:09.810
What happened?

00:37:53.396 --> 00:37:54.939
-The storyboard?
-Yes.

00:37:55.982 --> 00:37:57.733
Don't tell Director Gyeong though.

00:37:58.901 --> 00:38:02.905
I only saw it because Mr. Jeong
practically forced it out of Yu-chan.

00:38:07.868 --> 00:38:08.995
What did you think?

00:38:13.874 --> 00:38:14.834
It was good.

00:38:17.295 --> 00:38:21.299
You know how I worked on the script
with Director Ju for quite some time?

00:38:21.799 --> 00:38:23.968
I didn't do any of the writing,
but anyway…

00:38:26.095 --> 00:38:27.471
when I saw the storyboard,

00:38:28.306 --> 00:38:30.558
it felt like the words in the script

00:38:30.641 --> 00:38:33.185
had jumped off the pages and come to life.

00:38:38.357 --> 00:38:40.985
Don’t tell me
that’s why you’re in such a good mood.

00:38:41.068 --> 00:38:44.739
Of course that's what lifted my mood.
What else would it be?

00:38:46.782 --> 00:38:48.576
You're a certified workaholic.

00:38:50.453 --> 00:38:52.371
I do quite enjoy working.

00:38:53.372 --> 00:38:56.625
By the way, who came up with the idea
for scene 12, was it?

00:39:04.383 --> 00:39:05.259
We're here.

00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:08.471
You're right. We talked so much
that the drive went by quickly.

00:39:08.554 --> 00:39:09.847
Thanks for the ride.

00:39:10.639 --> 00:39:12.558
It's been some time, so this was nice.

00:39:13.351 --> 00:39:14.518
Drive safe.

00:39:19.982 --> 00:39:20.816
Eun-jung.

00:39:23.652 --> 00:39:24.653
Yes?

00:39:26.572 --> 00:39:27.490
I've never felt

00:39:28.657 --> 00:39:30.576
uncomfortable being around you.

00:39:35.039 --> 00:39:35.956
I'm glad.

00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:37.750
That's good to hear.

00:39:38.501 --> 00:39:40.336
I also don't feel uncomfortable anymore.

00:39:41.295 --> 00:39:45.174
From the moment we reconnected,
I was happy to see you again.

00:39:54.558 --> 00:39:56.310
I can’t say I felt the same.

00:40:00.147 --> 00:40:01.190
Take care.

00:43:36.614 --> 00:43:41.619
