BEYOND THE BAR

00:00:39.623 --> 00:00:40.749
Hyo-min.

00:00:41.375 --> 00:00:42.751
Please open this door.

00:00:43.544 --> 00:00:44.753
Why are you doing this to me?

00:00:44.836 --> 00:00:46.421
A girl

00:00:46.505 --> 00:00:48.632
- discovered a butterfly cocoon…
- Hyo-min.

00:00:48.715 --> 00:00:51.260
…and looked after it with much care.

00:00:53.512 --> 00:00:54.846
Talk to me, Hyo-min.

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:57.849
- Then, one day…
- Please, Hyo-min…

00:00:57.933 --> 00:01:01.603
…the butterfly inside the cocoon
tried with all its might to break free.

00:01:04.773 --> 00:01:08.485
The girl watched with sympathy.

00:01:11.655 --> 00:01:15.242
After painfully struggling for half a day,
the butterfly managed

00:01:16.118 --> 00:01:20.247
to free half of its body from the cocoon
and remained still, seemingly resting.

00:01:21.248 --> 00:01:24.626
It looked as if it did not have
the strength to continue.

00:01:25.711 --> 00:01:30.299
Unable to bear it any longer,
she made a small incision on the cocoon.

00:01:32.718 --> 00:01:35.846
When she did,
the butterfly was completely freed,

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:37.889
and it proceeded to flutter its wings.

00:01:39.766 --> 00:01:42.561
It looked as if it was ready
to soar into the sky.

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:13.342
However,

00:02:13.842 --> 00:02:17.179
the butterfly merely circled in midair
before dropping to the ground,

00:02:18.013 --> 00:02:19.723
without ever reaching the ceiling.

00:02:20.932 --> 00:02:22.726
- And there…
- Let's talk this out.

00:02:23.226 --> 00:02:26.355
- …both its fluttering and its life…
- Hyo-min.

00:02:27.022 --> 00:02:28.148
…came to an end.

00:02:28.732 --> 00:02:30.651
It's psychogenic dyslexia.

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.320
It could be a conversion disorder

00:02:33.403 --> 00:02:35.489
or a stress-induced cognitive impairment.

00:02:35.572 --> 00:02:36.615
Pardon?

00:02:38.241 --> 00:02:39.326
What do you mean…

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:42.287
Prolonged academic stress
and mental overload have led

00:02:42.954 --> 00:02:44.748
to a temporary decline
in the brain's ability

00:02:44.831 --> 00:02:46.500
to process visual information.

00:02:46.583 --> 00:02:50.045
My child was in a gifted program
and even skipped two grades.

00:02:50.545 --> 00:02:51.963
People refer to her as a genius.

00:02:52.673 --> 00:02:56.843
This type of acquired dyslexia

00:02:57.594 --> 00:03:00.389
typically develops as a result

00:03:00.472 --> 00:03:03.392
of severe pressure and stress,
regardless of intellectual abilities…

00:03:03.475 --> 00:03:07.562
With the dead butterfly in her hands,

00:03:07.646 --> 00:03:09.064
the girl started crying.

00:03:10.273 --> 00:03:14.277
A butterfly must twist its whole body
and push against the cocoon

00:03:14.361 --> 00:03:17.572
to make its body grow lighter

00:03:17.656 --> 00:03:19.616
and its wings stronger.

00:03:20.117 --> 00:03:22.494
The girl did not realize that butterflies

00:03:23.036 --> 00:03:26.915
that do not undergo that process
are ultimately unable to take flight.

00:03:26.998 --> 00:03:31.878
BUTTERFLY CHRYSALIS

00:03:37.175 --> 00:03:39.553
{\an8}I'm so tired today.

00:03:39.636 --> 00:03:40.679
{\an8}Did you sleep well?

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:42.848
{\an8}- I slept a bit.
- I slept well.

00:03:42.931 --> 00:03:43.890
{\an8}You can order more meat.

00:03:45.767 --> 00:03:46.727
{\an8}Deok-ho.

00:03:47.477 --> 00:03:48.770
{\an8}Try this.

00:03:48.854 --> 00:03:50.605
{\an8}- I already have some.
- Just try it.

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:51.732
{\an8}Go on.

00:03:51.815 --> 00:03:53.483
{\an8}What's so special about it?

00:03:53.567 --> 00:03:55.944
{\an8}HANUN EXPRESS

00:03:56.027 --> 00:03:57.404
{\an8}It has quite a unique taste.

00:03:57.487 --> 00:04:00.282
{\an8}Have you ever heard of "Irish coffee"?

00:04:00.365 --> 00:04:01.533
{\an8}What's that?

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:07.664
It is tasty.

00:04:08.415 --> 00:04:09.416
I need to go.

00:04:09.499 --> 00:04:10.917
Take this for me.

00:04:11.001 --> 00:04:11.960
- See you.
- Bye.

00:04:12.043 --> 00:04:13.003
Take it easy.

00:04:14.421 --> 00:04:16.590
- But what's an Irish coffee?
- Well…

00:04:16.673 --> 00:04:19.676
My daughter bought it for me
at this fancy place last time.

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.345
It's coffee with whiskey.
It tastes amazing.

00:04:22.971 --> 00:04:25.891
I figured, "Why not?" So I tried
adding alcohol to instant coffee.

00:04:25.974 --> 00:04:27.434
I think it tastes pretty similar.

00:04:28.143 --> 00:04:29.186
Really?

00:04:29.269 --> 00:04:30.562
Make me a cup too.

00:05:03.261 --> 00:05:04.346
Good lord.

00:05:07.432 --> 00:05:09.768
HANUN EXPRESS

00:05:11.228 --> 00:05:13.647
Are you okay? Are you hurt anywhere?

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:15.774
Min-guk…

00:05:17.359 --> 00:05:18.235
How?

00:05:18.318 --> 00:05:21.154
- How could you?
- My apologies, ma'am.

00:05:22.197 --> 00:05:24.157
My goodness, Min-guk. Are you all right?

00:05:26.326 --> 00:05:27.911
- What do I do?
- Oh no…

00:05:27.994 --> 00:05:29.746
- Hello?
- How could you?

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:31.706
- How?
- I…

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:34.376
- I hit a child.
- What do I do?

00:05:34.459 --> 00:05:37.546
My goodness. Are you okay?
Are you hurt anywhere?

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:53.728
Goodness, you've been drinking.

00:05:55.063 --> 00:05:55.981
Pardon?

00:05:56.648 --> 00:05:57.983
What do you mean…

00:05:59.776 --> 00:06:02.028
You are being arrested
for driving under the influence.

00:06:02.112 --> 00:06:03.405
I didn't drink.

00:06:03.488 --> 00:06:05.532
You have the right to remain silent.

00:06:05.615 --> 00:06:08.118
- You may request a habeas corpus review--
- I didn't drink.

00:06:08.201 --> 00:06:09.619
Sure. Let's go to the station first.

00:06:09.703 --> 00:06:11.454
- I really didn't!
- Let's go to the station.

00:06:11.538 --> 00:06:13.206
- Let me try again!
- Please stay still.

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:14.541
- I didn't drink.
- Stay still.

00:06:14.624 --> 00:06:16.001
Come here. Come on.

00:06:22.048 --> 00:06:24.009
Hold on, this is…

00:06:38.315 --> 00:06:40.400
Doctor. Is my Min-guk okay?

00:06:43.403 --> 00:06:45.363
It's a bit strange…

00:06:45.989 --> 00:06:47.240
There are no external injuries.

00:06:47.324 --> 00:06:49.701
No signs of bruises
or the collision at all.

00:06:49.784 --> 00:06:51.202
What do you mean?

00:06:51.286 --> 00:06:54.331
It doesn't seem like
Min-guk got hit by the truck.

00:06:54.873 --> 00:06:56.708
Then why can't he use his legs--

00:06:56.791 --> 00:06:59.461
There's no sign
of a collision with the delivery truck,

00:06:59.544 --> 00:07:01.296
but a functional impairment

00:07:01.379 --> 00:07:03.924
has developed in part
of his spinal nerve pathways.

00:07:05.258 --> 00:07:09.304
Internal injuries like this are
usually caused by external trauma.

00:07:10.305 --> 00:07:11.806
There are no signs of a collision,

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:15.268
but these are the same symptoms
you'd expect from a collision.

00:07:16.478 --> 00:07:19.689
I just don't understand
what you're saying at all right now.

00:07:24.319 --> 00:07:25.403
Hello?

00:07:25.987 --> 00:07:27.489
Yes, that's right.

00:07:31.618 --> 00:07:32.494
Pardon?

00:07:38.041 --> 00:07:39.000
Doctor.

00:07:40.502 --> 00:07:42.921
They checked the security footage,
and it showed…

00:07:44.589 --> 00:07:46.257
that the truck

00:07:47.258 --> 00:07:48.677
did not hit Min-guk.

00:07:49.302 --> 00:07:50.261
Pardon?

00:07:50.345 --> 00:07:52.222
Wait, if he wasn't hit, then why…

00:07:52.722 --> 00:07:56.351
Why can't he move his legs?

00:07:56.434 --> 00:07:59.938
What are we going to do? My poor Min-guk…

00:08:02.941 --> 00:08:05.902
What do we do now, Doctor? Tell me.

00:08:05.986 --> 00:08:08.905
What should we do now?

00:08:09.781 --> 00:08:13.034
{\an8}Hold on, let's clarify.
Was he hit by the truck or not?

00:08:13.118 --> 00:08:16.788
He wasn't hit,
but he's injured as if he had been…

00:08:18.665 --> 00:08:19.708
What are you saying?

00:08:22.293 --> 00:08:23.795
Mr. Lee, can we get some clarity?

00:08:23.878 --> 00:08:26.256
Yes, sir.
So, the plaintiff's doctor claims

00:08:26.339 --> 00:08:28.508
the plaintiff shows symptoms
consistent with a collision,

00:08:28.591 --> 00:08:29.467
despite the fact…

00:08:29.551 --> 00:08:30.510
{\an8}PHYSICIAN'S STATEMENT

00:08:30.593 --> 00:08:33.388
{\an8}…that the delivery truck in question
made no physical contact.

00:08:33.471 --> 00:08:36.182
No collision, but the injuries
are consistent with one?

00:08:36.266 --> 00:08:37.308
Is that even possible?

00:08:37.934 --> 00:08:39.644
I'm not sure. That's what it says.

00:08:43.023 --> 00:08:45.400
Let's get a psychiatrist's opinion first.

00:08:45.483 --> 00:08:47.068
Schedule a consultation with Dr. Yeon.

00:08:47.152 --> 00:08:48.445
Yes, sir.

00:08:48.528 --> 00:08:50.613
- And who's representing the plaintiff?
- Lee & Seo.

00:08:52.407 --> 00:08:54.242
This isn't a major case, though.

00:08:54.325 --> 00:08:55.994
It seems they received
a hefty retainer fee.

00:08:56.077 --> 00:08:57.746
The settlement won't be that high.

00:08:57.829 --> 00:09:00.415
The plaintiff's family is wealthy,
so money won't be the issue.

00:09:00.498 --> 00:09:02.542
It appears the mother is a bit intense.

00:09:03.043 --> 00:09:04.502
Since her child was left disabled,

00:09:04.586 --> 00:09:07.756
she wants to send the deliveryman to jail
and bankrupt the delivery company.

00:09:07.839 --> 00:09:09.799
She was yelling and throwing a fit.

00:09:12.135 --> 00:09:15.472
Ms. Kang, you'll accompany me
to the consultation with Dr. Yeon.

00:09:15.555 --> 00:09:16.765
Yes, sir.

00:09:24.481 --> 00:09:25.815
Hey. What's up?

00:09:25.899 --> 00:09:28.109
He only spoke the truth.

00:09:28.193 --> 00:09:30.361
Come on, Father.

00:09:30.445 --> 00:09:33.490
What? What do you want me to do about it?

00:09:33.573 --> 00:09:35.950
Come on now…

00:09:36.034 --> 00:09:37.452
Listen, Tae-seop.

00:09:38.078 --> 00:09:39.370
Yes?

00:09:39.996 --> 00:09:41.998
I was the one who changed
all your dirty diapers.

00:09:42.082 --> 00:09:43.958
"Dirty"? What?

00:09:44.042 --> 00:09:46.336
Your mom and that nanny
said they would do it,

00:09:46.419 --> 00:09:48.046
but I insisted on doing it myself.

00:09:49.422 --> 00:09:50.423
Do you know why?

00:09:51.925 --> 00:09:53.218
Because you love me?

00:09:55.261 --> 00:09:57.097
Because it'd only last a year or two.

00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:58.306
Right.

00:09:59.015 --> 00:10:03.770
But it feels like I'm still changing
your dirty diapers even now…

00:10:03.853 --> 00:10:05.188
That's not what's happening here.

00:10:05.271 --> 00:10:07.440
Yoon Seok-hoon, he…

00:10:07.524 --> 00:10:10.693
All right. I hear you. So…

00:10:11.694 --> 00:10:12.904
Jeez.

00:10:14.531 --> 00:10:16.741
Have Mr. Yoon come to my office.

00:10:18.576 --> 00:10:19.702
Get away from me.

00:10:29.671 --> 00:10:31.756
I'll head out now.

00:10:38.721 --> 00:10:39.764
Take a seat.

00:10:48.439 --> 00:10:50.150
I asked to see you because…

00:11:01.119 --> 00:11:04.372
{\an8}It's a civil and criminal case,
and we're representing the defendant.

00:11:04.455 --> 00:11:08.501
The plaintiff is a five-year-old child,
and he was almost hit by a delivery truck.

00:11:08.585 --> 00:11:11.963
It was a close call,
but luckily, there was no collision.

00:11:12.046 --> 00:11:14.215
However, part of his spinal nerve pathways

00:11:14.299 --> 00:11:16.009
developed a functional impairment,

00:11:16.092 --> 00:11:19.137
so his mother filed
a civil and criminal lawsuit

00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:21.222
against the delivery company and driver.

00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:23.683
They say the child's symptoms

00:11:23.766 --> 00:11:26.811
are consistent with those
of a car crash victim.

00:11:28.229 --> 00:11:30.523
Is this medically possible?

00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:34.235
Yes, it is possible.

00:11:35.236 --> 00:11:38.698
It seems the child mistakenly believes
he was hit by the truck.

00:11:38.781 --> 00:11:39.991
He believes it?

00:11:40.074 --> 00:11:41.659
Yes, it appears his strong belief

00:11:41.743 --> 00:11:43.786
has led to physical symptoms.

00:11:45.079 --> 00:11:48.917
When an extreme psychological reaction
manifests itself as physical symptoms,

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.002
we refer to it as a conversion disorder.

00:11:51.753 --> 00:11:55.715
Along with that,
the nocebo effect likely played a role.

00:11:58.843 --> 00:12:01.554
Most people know about the placebo effect,

00:12:01.638 --> 00:12:04.599
where someone is healed
even after taking inert medication.

00:12:04.682 --> 00:12:06.935
But the opposite effect also exists.

00:12:07.018 --> 00:12:10.271
The nocebo effect occurs
when psychological fear or belief

00:12:10.355 --> 00:12:13.483
causes a real negative physical effect.

00:12:14.609 --> 00:12:19.781
In fact, in 1950,
there was a case involving a patient

00:12:19.864 --> 00:12:22.075
on a ship transporting wine
from Lisbon to the UK.

00:12:22.158 --> 00:12:25.995
The cargo ship was
on its way back to Lisbon

00:12:26.079 --> 00:12:28.206
after unloading all the wine at a UK port.

00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:30.166
Meanwhile, one of the crew members

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:33.920
got trapped in one
of the refrigerated shipping containers

00:12:34.003 --> 00:12:36.130
and froze to death.

00:12:37.215 --> 00:12:40.510
That makes sense.
He was trapped in there for a long time.

00:12:41.719 --> 00:12:45.181
As he was dying, he used a metal shard

00:12:45.265 --> 00:12:47.308
to write something on the freezer wall.

00:12:47.392 --> 00:12:48.268
THE COLD…

00:12:48.351 --> 00:12:53.022
He wrote, "At first, the cold froze
my nose, fingers, and toes."

00:12:53.523 --> 00:12:57.527
"As time passed, the freezing spread."

00:12:57.610 --> 00:12:59.195
After some time, he wrote,

00:12:59.279 --> 00:13:02.991
"Now I don't even feel the cold anymore,"
before dying.

00:13:03.741 --> 00:13:05.368
However, what's surprising

00:13:05.451 --> 00:13:08.079
is that without any wine
left in the freezer,

00:13:08.162 --> 00:13:10.248
they had turned it off,
and the temperature inside

00:13:10.331 --> 00:13:11.916
remained at 18 degrees.

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:15.211
It was certainly not cold enough
for someone to freeze to death.

00:13:15.295 --> 00:13:16.170
However, that man

00:13:16.254 --> 00:13:19.173
suffered all the symptoms
of freezing to death,

00:13:19.257 --> 00:13:21.342
before "freezing to death" himself.

00:13:21.426 --> 00:13:25.138
"I am locked in a freezer,
and I will end up freezing to death."

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:28.224
That thought led him to his death.

00:13:30.351 --> 00:13:31.602
That's amazing.

00:13:42.363 --> 00:13:44.782
We confirmed that it was
medically possible.

00:13:44.866 --> 00:13:46.117
Where do we go from here?

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:49.078
For now, check
the security footage of the accident

00:13:49.162 --> 00:13:50.955
and talk to the witnesses.

00:13:51.039 --> 00:13:51.998
All right.

00:13:53.291 --> 00:13:55.501
The boy just jumped out of nowhere.

00:13:56.711 --> 00:13:59.172
I watched in horror as it happened.

00:13:59.255 --> 00:14:02.467
Luckily, the truck stopped
just in the nick of time.

00:14:03.509 --> 00:14:05.428
I was incredibly relieved.

00:14:06.054 --> 00:14:08.556
But the boy collapsed
to the ground as if he were injured.

00:14:08.639 --> 00:14:14.312
That day, that boy's mother
frantically screamed her lungs out.

00:14:14.395 --> 00:14:17.023
So just based on her reaction, I thought,

00:14:17.106 --> 00:14:20.443
"Oh, that kid must have been crushed
to death by the truck."

00:14:20.526 --> 00:14:22.987
Really? How did she react?

00:14:23.071 --> 00:14:26.574
She was bawling her eyes out,
so I went up to her and said,

00:14:26.657 --> 00:14:29.452
"I don't think the truck hit him."

00:14:29.535 --> 00:14:32.705
The kid looked perfectly fine. No blood.

00:14:33.623 --> 00:14:36.834
But then suddenly,
the kid couldn't move his legs

00:14:36.918 --> 00:14:39.003
and seemed to be in so much pain.

00:14:39.087 --> 00:14:42.215
So then, we all assumed
the truck had hit him.

00:14:43.007 --> 00:14:44.175
I see…

00:15:01.651 --> 00:15:03.986
Goodness me. Wake up. Get up.

00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:05.279
- Sorry.
- Morning, sir!

00:15:13.413 --> 00:15:14.288
Hey.

00:15:14.372 --> 00:15:15.832
Hey, Hyo-min!

00:15:15.915 --> 00:15:18.209
Kang Hyo-min, get up already.
We're late for our meeting.

00:15:18.292 --> 00:15:19.752
What?

00:15:20.294 --> 00:15:21.295
The meeting with Mr. Yoon.

00:15:21.379 --> 00:15:22.964
- Meeting?
- Hurry up. We're late.

00:15:23.047 --> 00:15:24.715
- Hurry up.
- The meeting.

00:15:24.799 --> 00:15:26.134
- What time does it start?
- What?

00:15:26.217 --> 00:15:28.177
Just hurry up. Come on.

00:15:30.346 --> 00:15:31.556
Let's go!

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:42.358
- My apologies.
- Why are you late?

00:15:42.442 --> 00:15:43.401
Sorry.

00:15:44.068 --> 00:15:45.319
Did you pull an all-nighter?

00:15:46.612 --> 00:15:48.406
Are you growing a beard over there?

00:15:50.199 --> 00:15:54.412
{\an8}"Associates Who Leave Big Law Firms
in Search of Work-Life Balance."

00:15:55.163 --> 00:15:57.123
"When work-life balance
outweighs pay cuts,

00:15:57.206 --> 00:15:59.333
they seek out in-house counsel positions."

00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:03.004
Out of all the articles to sleep on…

00:16:03.087 --> 00:16:04.922
Did you sleep on a newspaper?

00:16:05.006 --> 00:16:06.757
The print is stamped on your face.

00:16:10.386 --> 00:16:11.762
The other side.

00:16:12.388 --> 00:16:13.389
Here?

00:16:15.099 --> 00:16:16.142
Wipe it off.

00:16:21.063 --> 00:16:23.065
Just wash your whole face
while you're at it.

00:16:28.738 --> 00:16:29.780
Thank you.

00:16:51.135 --> 00:16:52.345
But why an all-nighter?

00:16:52.428 --> 00:16:54.096
I didn't give you that much work.

00:16:56.641 --> 00:16:59.810
Mr. Hong gave us an assignment.

00:16:59.894 --> 00:17:03.940
I saw his associates go home
right on time for the past two days.

00:17:04.023 --> 00:17:05.024
What's the assignment?

00:17:05.107 --> 00:17:06.609
Basically hard labor.

00:17:08.694 --> 00:17:12.448
He told us to organize ten years' worth
of corporate due diligence data.

00:17:12.532 --> 00:17:14.408
Why didn't you tell me?

00:17:14.492 --> 00:17:17.286
He said it was Mr. Ko's case,
so it was important…

00:17:17.370 --> 00:17:19.664
There's also what happened last time.

00:17:19.747 --> 00:17:21.958
We didn't want to cause more conflict…

00:17:22.875 --> 00:17:23.918
But…

00:17:24.752 --> 00:17:28.339
Mr. Ko's M&A case closed last week.

00:17:28.422 --> 00:17:29.590
- What?
- Pardon?

00:17:30.424 --> 00:17:32.552
Sounds like this was revenge.

00:17:39.517 --> 00:17:41.060
Let's start the meeting.

00:17:41.143 --> 00:17:42.395
Yes, sir.

00:17:42.478 --> 00:17:44.188
- Yes.
- Yes, sir.

00:17:44.814 --> 00:17:46.315
Seriously?

00:17:47.608 --> 00:17:49.777
HANUN EXPRESS

00:17:49.944 --> 00:17:51.612
The nocebo effect…

00:17:51.696 --> 00:17:54.407
I'd only heard about it,
but I guess it's real.

00:17:54.490 --> 00:17:55.950
If it really is a nocebo effect,

00:17:56.033 --> 00:17:59.370
then Min-guk's mental misperception
is to blame for his physical symptoms.

00:17:59.453 --> 00:18:01.372
The misbelief that the truck hit him.

00:18:01.455 --> 00:18:04.834
That false belief triggered
physical symptoms.

00:18:05.751 --> 00:18:06.627
Right.

00:18:06.711 --> 00:18:08.838
If you watch
the security footage of the accident,

00:18:08.921 --> 00:18:11.340
Min-guk's mom believed the truck hit him.

00:18:11.424 --> 00:18:13.634
The brakes screeched loudly,

00:18:13.718 --> 00:18:15.803
and Min-guk was on the ground
in front of the truck.

00:18:15.886 --> 00:18:17.263
She ran over in sheer panic,

00:18:17.346 --> 00:18:18.889
thinking he'd been hit and hurt badly.

00:18:18.973 --> 00:18:20.141
She must have.

00:18:20.224 --> 00:18:23.811
He would've been hurt quite badly
if he had been hit by a truck that big.

00:18:23.894 --> 00:18:24.895
But…

00:18:25.479 --> 00:18:28.232
Min-guk was also paying attention
to his mother's reaction.

00:18:28.316 --> 00:18:31.569
Min-guk's mother was
in total panic because she believed

00:18:31.652 --> 00:18:33.613
Min-guk was hit by the truck.

00:18:34.113 --> 00:18:36.532
And as he watched
his mother react that way--

00:18:36.616 --> 00:18:39.285
He mistakenly believed
he was hit by the truck?

00:18:39.368 --> 00:18:40.870
If such a false belief

00:18:40.953 --> 00:18:43.914
is to blame for his physical symptoms…

00:18:43.998 --> 00:18:47.877
Establishing a causal link
between the threat of collision

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:49.920
and Min-guk's physical symptoms
will be difficult.

00:18:50.004 --> 00:18:51.172
Yes.

00:18:51.255 --> 00:18:53.299
The human mind is mysterious.

00:18:54.008 --> 00:18:57.511
We do not know what caused
such a physical response.

00:18:58.512 --> 00:19:00.139
Whether it was the threat of collision…

00:19:01.265 --> 00:19:03.017
Or his mother's overreaction.

00:19:04.894 --> 00:19:05.770
Right.

00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:09.273
- Wow…
- Wow…

00:19:09.982 --> 00:19:11.233
Kang Hyo-min.

00:19:11.317 --> 00:19:13.861
As expected, you're amazing, Mr. Yoon.

00:19:13.944 --> 00:19:15.446
Wow…

00:19:20.826 --> 00:19:23.871
Mr. Yoon, are you just going
to let Mr. Hong get away with it?

00:19:23.954 --> 00:19:25.831
Really? Come on, bro.

00:19:31.087 --> 00:19:32.296
Hey, Mr. Yoon.

00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:34.256
We should make our greetings audible.

00:19:35.424 --> 00:19:36.801
Hey, Yoon Seok-hoon!

00:19:42.264 --> 00:19:44.100
Did you not have a meeting with Mr. Ko?

00:19:44.183 --> 00:19:45.518
I did.

00:19:45.601 --> 00:19:46.894
And this is how you act?

00:19:47.978 --> 00:19:49.063
I'm a bit busy.

00:19:50.981 --> 00:19:52.233
Why that…

00:19:52.733 --> 00:19:53.609
That little…

00:19:56.153 --> 00:19:57.029
Tae-seop.

00:19:57.697 --> 00:19:59.281
Mr. Ko did give him a warning, right?

00:20:00.157 --> 00:20:01.075
Probably.

00:20:01.617 --> 00:20:03.411
Jeez. He's so obnoxious.

00:20:03.494 --> 00:20:05.079
Damn, that startled me.

00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:07.998
Did he tattle to his dad? So petty.

00:20:08.082 --> 00:20:10.584
Bro, did Mr. Ko give you an earful?

00:20:10.668 --> 00:20:12.795
That's why you're
putting up with Mr. Hong?

00:20:13.337 --> 00:20:14.213
That's not it.

00:20:15.339 --> 00:20:18.551
The associates have been buzzing
since that incident last time,

00:20:18.634 --> 00:20:20.803
saying Ms. Kwon
was pushed out by Ko Tae-seop

00:20:20.886 --> 00:20:23.764
to be dispatched
as a small business in-house counsel.

00:20:23.848 --> 00:20:25.057
Let's be honest, the only thing

00:20:25.141 --> 00:20:27.852
Tae-seop has working for him
is that his father is a Yullim founder.

00:20:27.935 --> 00:20:31.397
But the great Ms. Kwon
was demoted in one swift swoop.

00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:34.108
Mr. Ko can pretend
to be fair all he wants.

00:20:34.191 --> 00:20:36.777
In the end, he puts his family first.

00:20:36.861 --> 00:20:38.237
That's the situation…

00:20:56.422 --> 00:20:57.423
Wow.

00:20:57.965 --> 00:20:59.467
What is this scent?

00:21:00.676 --> 00:21:01.802
It smells so good.

00:21:03.554 --> 00:21:04.430
MR. HONG DO-YUN

00:21:12.772 --> 00:21:14.023
Hello?

00:21:16.484 --> 00:21:17.610
Right now?

00:21:18.444 --> 00:21:21.113
Sure. All right.

00:21:27.703 --> 00:21:29.955
I asked to see you because…

00:21:31.916 --> 00:21:34.126
Well, I'm only getting older.

00:21:35.377 --> 00:21:38.005
I plan to retire soon
and stay on as an advisor.

00:21:39.256 --> 00:21:42.843
I feel like I should first pass on
my managing partner title to someone.

00:21:45.471 --> 00:21:48.849
I was wondering if you would be
interested in filling that position.

00:21:51.685 --> 00:21:52.603
Are you surprised?

00:21:58.150 --> 00:21:59.443
Mr. Yoon Seok-hoon.

00:22:00.319 --> 00:22:02.863
Will you become
a managing partner of Yullim?

00:22:13.582 --> 00:22:15.000
I appreciate the offer,

00:22:16.961 --> 00:22:18.629
but I will have to decline.

00:22:19.672 --> 00:22:20.673
What…

00:22:20.756 --> 00:22:21.632
May I ask why?

00:22:22.758 --> 00:22:24.844
Becoming the first managing partner
in his thirties

00:22:24.927 --> 00:22:26.679
at one of the top five law firms

00:22:26.762 --> 00:22:30.140
should guarantee a nomination
from any political party of your choosing.

00:22:30.224 --> 00:22:31.684
I'm sorry, but I'm not interested.

00:22:35.855 --> 00:22:39.567
Please feel free to share
if there is something holding you back.

00:22:44.363 --> 00:22:47.491
I have no desire to become
the captain of a sinking ship.

00:22:47.575 --> 00:22:48.492
"A sinking ship"?

00:22:51.954 --> 00:22:55.708
You must be aware that Yullim ranked first
in second-half revenue last year.

00:22:56.500 --> 00:22:58.502
We surpassed Lee & Seo.

00:22:59.587 --> 00:23:00.963
It's a false dawn.

00:23:02.506 --> 00:23:04.133
"A false dawn"?

00:23:06.427 --> 00:23:07.970
And what makes you think that?

00:23:08.053 --> 00:23:11.098
The three named partners
are the rainmakers of Yullim.

00:23:11.807 --> 00:23:13.726
Your connections facilitate
client acquisition.

00:23:14.768 --> 00:23:15.811
Your connections

00:23:15.895 --> 00:23:19.148
are executives and CEOs
at major corporations and financial firms,

00:23:19.231 --> 00:23:21.442
allowing you to maintain Yullim's revenue,

00:23:21.525 --> 00:23:23.402
but they're like setting suns.

00:23:23.485 --> 00:23:25.404
And Yullim is setting along with them.

00:23:25.487 --> 00:23:28.449
On the other hand,
Lee & Seo, Daeyeong, and Yang & Kim

00:23:28.532 --> 00:23:31.660
focused on honing their brands
and expertise to attract clients.

00:23:31.744 --> 00:23:33.996
So even when a named partner
begins to fade,

00:23:34.079 --> 00:23:36.248
the firm retains its corporate integrity.

00:23:37.333 --> 00:23:39.585
Well, yes. I concur.

00:23:39.668 --> 00:23:41.086
"A false dawn."

00:23:42.129 --> 00:23:44.632
But don't you think

00:23:44.715 --> 00:23:47.718
we have enough time to restructure
before it sets for good?

00:23:47.801 --> 00:23:50.512
Then someone's going
to have to make heads roll.

00:23:51.513 --> 00:23:54.266
Old guards who sit on their hands
with no client appeal,

00:23:55.768 --> 00:23:58.062
partners with no real expertise
who bring in low-value cases

00:23:58.145 --> 00:23:59.605
through backroom schmoozing,

00:24:00.314 --> 00:24:03.943
and the inept parasitic associates
who were hired to maintain connections

00:24:05.694 --> 00:24:08.238
will all need to go
if we're going to restructure.

00:24:10.991 --> 00:24:13.202
It appears you're looking
for an executioner,

00:24:14.161 --> 00:24:16.664
but I have no intention
of becoming your hatchet man.

00:24:20.376 --> 00:24:22.503
I can't become the executioner
for your sake…

00:24:29.468 --> 00:24:31.804
I am a partner lawyer!

00:24:33.430 --> 00:24:34.890
Are you kidding me right now?

00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:37.309
Don't you know who I am?

00:24:38.352 --> 00:24:42.147
How dare a newbie still wet
behind the ears talk to me like that?

00:24:45.067 --> 00:24:46.151
What's the matter?

00:24:46.235 --> 00:24:47.778
Tell him exactly what you told me.

00:24:48.904 --> 00:24:50.197
What's wrong? What's going on?

00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:52.199
He asked me for help with an op-ed,

00:24:52.282 --> 00:24:55.077
so I told him I'd look it over
if he gave me a draft.

00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:57.287
Well… That's…

00:24:57.830 --> 00:25:00.499
Mr. Hong will be credited
as the author of the op-ed.

00:25:00.582 --> 00:25:02.251
I also mentioned that if I wrote it,

00:25:02.334 --> 00:25:05.504
it would be like deceiving the readers.

00:25:07.339 --> 00:25:09.508
My apologies, sir. I--

00:25:09.591 --> 00:25:11.719
Yullim is one of the top five
law firms in Korea.

00:25:11.802 --> 00:25:14.346
They must have requested an op-ed
because they wanted to hear

00:25:14.430 --> 00:25:16.473
from a partner
at one of the top five law firms.

00:25:16.557 --> 00:25:18.308
If I have to write it…

00:25:18.392 --> 00:25:19.768
Well, I'd be thrilled,

00:25:19.852 --> 00:25:22.438
but shouldn't I be credited
as the author, then?

00:25:23.105 --> 00:25:25.024
Or at least as a co-author.

00:25:25.566 --> 00:25:26.775
Why don't we have a chat?

00:25:26.859 --> 00:25:28.485
And while we're at it,

00:25:28.569 --> 00:25:32.448
why did you have Mr. Ji and me
do due diligence on that closed case?

00:25:32.531 --> 00:25:33.699
Wasn't that a pointless drill?

00:25:33.782 --> 00:25:35.242
"Pointless drill"?

00:25:36.368 --> 00:25:38.787
Man… being at the top of your class

00:25:38.871 --> 00:25:41.123
has inflated your ego
to an unmanageable size.

00:25:41.206 --> 00:25:43.625
I don't want to mimic
what a salary thief said,

00:25:43.709 --> 00:25:46.045
but this is workplace harassment.

00:25:46.128 --> 00:25:48.756
What did you say, punk?
Have you lost your damn mind?

00:25:49.339 --> 00:25:50.924
The meeting is at 2:30?

00:25:52.176 --> 00:25:53.844
Yes, sir. It's at 2:30.

00:25:53.927 --> 00:25:56.513
We'll probably hit traffic.
We should leave now.

00:25:56.597 --> 00:25:57.848
Yes, sir.

00:26:24.625 --> 00:26:25.834
Thank you.

00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:27.920
I wasn't trying to help you.

00:26:28.003 --> 00:26:29.630
The meeting was coming up.

00:26:30.881 --> 00:26:32.091
And what about Mr. Lee?

00:26:32.716 --> 00:26:34.510
The two of us will be handling this case.

00:26:44.478 --> 00:26:46.396
We're here for the 2:30 meeting.

00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:47.439
Where are you from?

00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:49.191
Yullim Law Firm.

00:26:49.274 --> 00:26:50.317
Okay.

00:26:50.818 --> 00:26:53.237
I guess the client isn't here yet.

00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:57.282
I don't see a 2:30 meeting.
Who was it scheduled with?

00:26:57.366 --> 00:26:59.118
Mr. Han Seong-chan.

00:26:59.201 --> 00:27:00.369
Just a moment.

00:27:02.955 --> 00:27:05.082
- Oh, you mean the two o'clock meeting?
- Two o'clock?

00:27:05.165 --> 00:27:07.876
The civil and criminal case
involving Hanun Express, right?

00:27:10.087 --> 00:27:11.004
Yes, that's right.

00:27:11.088 --> 00:27:14.049
The meeting started at two,
and all the attendees arrived already.

00:27:16.051 --> 00:27:17.344
Wasn't the meeting at 2:30?

00:27:17.427 --> 00:27:21.431
Yes. I was told by Lee & Seo
that it was 2:30.

00:27:23.308 --> 00:27:26.353
Mr. Kim Deok-ho got behind the wheel

00:27:26.436 --> 00:27:28.772
after working 14 hours
and drinking alcohol on top of that.

00:27:28.856 --> 00:27:32.943
Both driving under the influence
and drowsy driving have been confirmed.

00:27:33.026 --> 00:27:37.030
A no-contact accident occurred due
to Mr. Kim's drunk driving and negligence.

00:27:37.114 --> 00:27:40.033
And as a result, our plaintiff suffered
both mental and physical injuries.

00:27:40.117 --> 00:27:43.745
Thus, we are claiming
200 million won in damages.

00:27:43.829 --> 00:27:46.456
Furthermore, my client
does not intend to settle

00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:49.334
or show any leniency
regarding the criminal charges.

00:27:49.418 --> 00:27:53.046
You know that the sentences are harsher
after the Min-sik Law was passed.

00:27:54.006 --> 00:27:56.842
No, I did not drive drunk.

00:27:56.925 --> 00:27:59.261
You keep making that claim,

00:27:59.344 --> 00:28:03.182
but you were Breathalyzed and arrested
as a flagrant offender at the scene.

00:28:03.265 --> 00:28:04.391
No, I…

00:28:05.434 --> 00:28:07.352
I just drank some instant coffee.

00:28:07.436 --> 00:28:10.939
I honestly did not know
there was alcohol in it. I swear.

00:28:11.023 --> 00:28:12.649
Are you being serious right now?

00:28:14.860 --> 00:28:15.903
I'm sorry.

00:28:17.070 --> 00:28:18.071
Please forgive me.

00:28:18.739 --> 00:28:19.823
Forgive you?

00:28:21.617 --> 00:28:24.745
You ask for forgiveness
after leaving someone's kid disabled?

00:28:27.331 --> 00:28:29.041
If you want to be forgiven,

00:28:29.124 --> 00:28:31.126
cripple your child and bring them here.

00:28:31.210 --> 00:28:32.419
Ma'am.

00:28:32.502 --> 00:28:35.047
Break their legs and drag them here!

00:28:35.130 --> 00:28:36.089
Ma'am, please calm down.

00:28:37.674 --> 00:28:39.259
Get down and beg at least.

00:28:39.968 --> 00:28:41.470
Mr. Kim, do you have 200 million?

00:28:42.221 --> 00:28:44.848
Our insurance won't cover
a drunk driving accident.

00:28:44.932 --> 00:28:47.434
That means you have to pay everything
out of your pocket.

00:28:47.517 --> 00:28:48.685
Do you know how much

00:28:48.769 --> 00:28:50.729
the criminal fine will be
without a settlement?

00:28:50.812 --> 00:28:53.232
You'll have to pay for all that too.

00:28:54.775 --> 00:28:56.360
Where would I find that kind of money?

00:28:56.443 --> 00:28:57.611
Exactly!

00:28:58.570 --> 00:28:59.988
Pardon me.

00:29:01.073 --> 00:29:03.116
So get on your hands and knees,

00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:05.911
and beg for forgiveness
like your life depended on it.

00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:26.682
I'm sorry.

00:29:28.183 --> 00:29:29.309
Please forgive me.

00:29:35.983 --> 00:29:37.276
Please get up.

00:29:45.534 --> 00:29:46.785
Please return to your seat.

00:29:52.416 --> 00:29:55.294
I get that you're scared,
but let's play fair, shall we?

00:29:55.377 --> 00:29:56.962
What are you talking about?

00:29:59.423 --> 00:30:01.049
So, to summarize,

00:30:01.133 --> 00:30:02.801
Mr. Kim Deok-ho's drunk driving

00:30:02.884 --> 00:30:05.095
and negligence caused
a no-contact accident,

00:30:05.178 --> 00:30:07.514
resulting in the plaintiff's
mental and physical injuries--

00:30:07.597 --> 00:30:08.598
Hold on.

00:30:09.516 --> 00:30:12.769
On what grounds are you claiming
the no-contact accident

00:30:12.853 --> 00:30:14.938
caused the plaintiff's physical injuries?

00:30:20.402 --> 00:30:22.821
Nowhere does it say in this brief
submitted by the plaintiff

00:30:22.904 --> 00:30:24.114
that there is a causal link

00:30:24.197 --> 00:30:26.074
between the no-contact accident
and his injuries.

00:30:26.158 --> 00:30:27.784
It's just a matter of common sense.

00:30:28.744 --> 00:30:29.911
"Common sense"?

00:30:29.995 --> 00:30:32.706
Since when did lawyers rely
on common sense and not legal reasoning?

00:30:32.789 --> 00:30:35.917
A perfectly healthy child became paralyzed
from the waist down after the accident.

00:30:36.001 --> 00:30:38.462
What could possibly negate
that causal link?

00:30:38.545 --> 00:30:41.715
If there had been a collision,
the causal link would be irrefutable.

00:30:41.798 --> 00:30:44.760
There was no collision,
but there certainly was a threat of one.

00:30:44.843 --> 00:30:47.220
The threat of a collision
led to psychological shock,

00:30:47.304 --> 00:30:48.847
and it manifested as physical symptoms.

00:30:48.930 --> 00:30:50.974
The human mind is mysterious.

00:30:51.058 --> 00:30:54.269
You must prove that the threat
of a collision led the plaintiff

00:30:54.353 --> 00:30:57.814
to suffer psychological shock leading
to the paralysis of his legs.

00:30:57.898 --> 00:30:59.566
That is the plaintiff's burden of proof.

00:31:04.029 --> 00:31:06.406
It seems you remain
unprepared on that front.

00:31:06.490 --> 00:31:09.534
We should not waste any more time
when time is money for us.

00:31:09.618 --> 00:31:12.537
Please reach out when you are prepared.

00:31:13.622 --> 00:31:14.873
We can leave now.

00:31:26.259 --> 00:31:27.386
What the…

00:31:28.345 --> 00:31:30.639
What is that lawyer talking about?

00:31:32.766 --> 00:31:35.769
Let's request a psychiatric assessment
of the plaintiff during pretrial.

00:31:35.852 --> 00:31:37.270
Yes, sir. Understood.

00:31:38.397 --> 00:31:41.400
You can lead the pretrial procedure.

00:31:42.025 --> 00:31:42.901
Yes…

00:31:45.278 --> 00:31:46.154
Wait, me?

00:31:46.238 --> 00:31:47.406
What's wrong?

00:31:48.031 --> 00:31:48.907
Not confident?

00:31:49.741 --> 00:31:51.868
I am. I'll give it a go.

00:31:54.371 --> 00:31:56.164
First, prepare a draft of the brief.

00:31:56.915 --> 00:31:58.542
Yes, sir.

00:32:01.795 --> 00:32:04.631
COURT

00:32:05.257 --> 00:32:07.300
This case is quite a simple one.

00:32:07.384 --> 00:32:10.303
{\an8}The defendant, Mr. Kim Deok-ho,

00:32:10.387 --> 00:32:11.555
{\an8}drove in a state of exhaustion

00:32:11.638 --> 00:32:14.266
after working for over 14 hours
and even consuming alcohol.

00:32:14.349 --> 00:32:18.478
Despite being fully aware
of the accident risks,

00:32:18.562 --> 00:32:19.855
{\an8}he got behind the wheel,

00:32:19.938 --> 00:32:23.650
and that negligence
caused a no-contact accident.

00:32:23.733 --> 00:32:27.154
The defendant's unlawful actions
did not cause a physical collision,

00:32:27.237 --> 00:32:28.697
but the threat of one was posed,

00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:31.700
and the plaintiff suffered
mental and physical injuries as a result.

00:32:31.783 --> 00:32:34.578
We seek 200 million won in damages.

00:32:35.454 --> 00:32:37.122
Thank you.

00:32:38.039 --> 00:32:38.957
Defense counsel.

00:32:48.967 --> 00:32:51.761
The defense argues
that the plaintiff's medical condition

00:32:51.845 --> 00:32:53.680
was not caused by the threat of collision

00:32:53.763 --> 00:32:56.725
but by the overreaction displayed
by the plaintiff's mother,

00:32:56.808 --> 00:32:59.060
Ms. Lee Sang-mi, at the scene.

00:32:59.144 --> 00:33:00.562
Hold on, what was that?

00:33:00.645 --> 00:33:02.564
Your Honor, this is unacceptable.

00:33:02.647 --> 00:33:04.274
I don't know what their scheme is--

00:33:04.357 --> 00:33:05.901
Maintain decorum.

00:33:07.777 --> 00:33:09.529
We cannot accept the defendant's argument.

00:33:10.530 --> 00:33:13.658
The plaintiff's counsel has failed
to provide any evidence

00:33:13.742 --> 00:33:17.078
that proves the threat of collision
caused the plaintiff's medical condition.

00:33:17.162 --> 00:33:19.831
Since we're still unable to confirm
what the exact cause was,

00:33:19.915 --> 00:33:21.541
we request

00:33:21.625 --> 00:33:24.586
a psychiatric assessment
of the plaintiff's mental state,

00:33:24.669 --> 00:33:26.838
which remains central to this case.

00:33:27.589 --> 00:33:28.673
Thank you.

00:33:29.174 --> 00:33:31.259
Does the plaintiff's counsel consent?

00:33:32.719 --> 00:33:33.803
Plaintiff's counsel.

00:33:37.933 --> 00:33:39.184
Yes, we consent.

00:33:39.267 --> 00:33:40.310
Seriously?

00:33:40.810 --> 00:33:45.190
Haven't you done enough
to torture my child?

00:33:47.192 --> 00:33:49.778
Submit a request
for the plaintiff's medical records

00:33:49.861 --> 00:33:51.238
and review them thoroughly.

00:33:51.821 --> 00:33:52.697
Yes, sir.

00:33:58.954 --> 00:33:59.871
Is there anything else?

00:33:59.955 --> 00:34:01.498
No, but…

00:34:02.123 --> 00:34:04.751
I was just wondering
if you had something to say.

00:34:05.377 --> 00:34:09.422
Perhaps an assessment
of the argument I just made in court…

00:34:13.218 --> 00:34:14.302
Earlier…

00:34:16.137 --> 00:34:17.055
you did well.

00:34:19.432 --> 00:34:20.475
Thank you!

00:34:27.607 --> 00:34:28.483
I see.

00:34:28.984 --> 00:34:30.485
I'll let her know.

00:34:32.946 --> 00:34:35.240
Ma'am, unfortunately,

00:34:35.323 --> 00:34:37.576
the doctor is not available for a meeting.

00:34:37.659 --> 00:34:40.120
- I see…
- Court orders were followed,

00:34:40.203 --> 00:34:42.289
and the medical records
were already submitted.

00:34:42.372 --> 00:34:44.958
The doctor says
we are under no obligation to meet

00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:47.586
with the patient's opposing counsel
one-on-one.

00:34:48.628 --> 00:34:51.089
I just have one simple question to ask.

00:34:51.172 --> 00:34:52.882
Even so…

00:34:54.968 --> 00:34:56.011
Sorry.

00:35:16.197 --> 00:35:17.490
Hyo-min!

00:35:21.161 --> 00:35:23.246
- Oh, right!
- Are you here to see me?

00:35:23.997 --> 00:35:25.290
No, for work.

00:35:25.373 --> 00:35:27.751
Why are you at a hospital for work?

00:35:28.501 --> 00:35:31.463
Well, the plaintiff is
a five-year-old boy, and I noticed

00:35:31.546 --> 00:35:33.923
he visited the hospital
five or six times a week,

00:35:34.007 --> 00:35:35.342
but there were no prescriptions.

00:35:35.425 --> 00:35:38.845
If he was here that frequently,
he must have a serious illness,

00:35:38.928 --> 00:35:40.597
so it's strange that there are no records.

00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:44.059
I was going to ask his doctor,
but they refused to meet with me.

00:35:44.142 --> 00:35:46.436
And… you're the defendant's counsel?

00:35:46.519 --> 00:35:47.395
Yes.

00:35:47.479 --> 00:35:48.980
Then it's only natural.

00:35:49.064 --> 00:35:51.274
Why would they meet the opposing counsel?

00:35:51.941 --> 00:35:55.612
But if there are no prescription records
despite frequent hospital visits,

00:35:56.821 --> 00:35:59.366
it could be a case
of Munchausen syndrome or hypochondria.

00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:02.369
"Munchausen"? What's that?

00:36:03.286 --> 00:36:06.748
Munchausen syndrome is a mental disorder
characterized by faking symptoms.

00:36:06.831 --> 00:36:08.166
They're physically healthy

00:36:08.249 --> 00:36:10.585
but fake illnesses
to receive attention from others.

00:36:11.711 --> 00:36:14.047
And hypochondria is an anxiety disorder

00:36:14.130 --> 00:36:16.216
where patients believe
they are seriously ill,

00:36:16.299 --> 00:36:18.843
or their fear of a serious illness
becomes so intense

00:36:18.927 --> 00:36:21.221
that they start obsessing
over their health.

00:36:22.347 --> 00:36:24.391
I see…

00:36:28.228 --> 00:36:30.397
Thanks, Seol-a. See you at home later.

00:36:31.398 --> 00:36:32.857
I'll pick up something tasty!

00:36:34.192 --> 00:36:35.068
I want beef.

00:36:35.568 --> 00:36:36.653
Not pork. Beef.

00:36:41.241 --> 00:36:44.327
The psychiatric evaluation results
are just as we expected.

00:36:44.953 --> 00:36:47.914
Yes, they should be able
to support our argument.

00:36:47.997 --> 00:36:51.334
And it seems the plaintiff suffered

00:36:51.418 --> 00:36:54.504
from Munchausen syndrome or hypochondria
due to his overprotective mother.

00:36:54.587 --> 00:36:55.588
Why do you say that?

00:36:55.672 --> 00:36:58.049
He visited the hospital
five or six times a week,

00:36:58.133 --> 00:37:00.260
but there are no prescription records.

00:37:01.761 --> 00:37:04.639
That could also serve as evidence
to support our argument.

00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:09.310
Favorable testimony from the plaintiff's
attending physician is unlikely.

00:37:09.394 --> 00:37:11.354
It would be ideal
if we could obtain a statement

00:37:11.438 --> 00:37:13.064
from a renowned pediatrician.

00:37:13.690 --> 00:37:15.650
{\an8}- Yes, understood.
- And…

00:37:16.943 --> 00:37:18.695
I reviewed your draft.

00:37:19.654 --> 00:37:22.490
That's all you could cook up
with those great ingredients?

00:37:23.366 --> 00:37:26.119
You're trying to argue
that the defendant is not to blame

00:37:26.202 --> 00:37:28.079
for the plaintiff's current state, right?

00:37:29.748 --> 00:37:31.499
Yes, that's right.

00:37:31.583 --> 00:37:34.711
In other words,
the plaintiff ended up like that

00:37:34.794 --> 00:37:37.088
because of his mother.

00:37:37.172 --> 00:37:38.465
- That might be taking it--
- No.

00:37:38.548 --> 00:37:39.883
That's just enough.

00:37:40.550 --> 00:37:42.469
If we do not present another cause,

00:37:42.552 --> 00:37:44.137
we cannot negate the causal link

00:37:44.220 --> 00:37:46.973
between the no-contact accident
and the plaintiff's state.

00:37:47.766 --> 00:37:49.809
Yes, but the plaintiff's mother--

00:37:49.893 --> 00:37:51.102
I will revise the brief.

00:37:56.649 --> 00:37:57.525
Yes, sir.

00:38:17.462 --> 00:38:18.463
Hyo-min.

00:38:24.844 --> 00:38:26.888
Wow, it's Hyo-min.

00:38:28.306 --> 00:38:29.974
What took you so long?

00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:33.770
You just have to pull out
all the stops, don't you?

00:38:33.853 --> 00:38:36.981
Why would you say such a hurtful thing?

00:38:37.065 --> 00:38:39.150
You're hurt? Why would you be hurt?

00:38:39.234 --> 00:38:40.819
Of course I'm hurt.

00:38:40.902 --> 00:38:43.112
You blocked my number
as soon as we broke up.

00:38:43.947 --> 00:38:46.241
You probably deleted all our photos too.

00:38:46.324 --> 00:38:49.369
One of us went on a blind date
right after the breakup.

00:38:49.452 --> 00:38:50.411
That was…

00:38:51.538 --> 00:38:54.207
a mistake that I made because I panicked.

00:38:55.208 --> 00:38:57.502
Would you kill someone
and call it a "mistake"?

00:38:57.585 --> 00:38:59.796
I got scared as I was listening to you.

00:39:00.672 --> 00:39:04.676
I was afraid my child would end up
with an inherited disability.

00:39:05.385 --> 00:39:08.012
How could I marry you, feeling like that?

00:39:08.513 --> 00:39:12.141
Rationally, I thought breaking up
would be the right choice,

00:39:12.225 --> 00:39:13.893
but my heart

00:39:14.769 --> 00:39:16.229
refused to follow my head.

00:39:16.729 --> 00:39:18.189
So without even realizing it, I--

00:39:18.273 --> 00:39:19.566
Hey.

00:39:19.649 --> 00:39:22.735
If you want to become a joke,
leave me out of it. Stay away.

00:39:22.819 --> 00:39:27.282
And if we ever meet professionally,
don't slip up.

00:39:28.908 --> 00:39:30.159
Hey, Kang Hyo-min.

00:40:02.525 --> 00:40:03.651
Ji-eun.

00:40:05.695 --> 00:40:06.905
What?

00:40:06.988 --> 00:40:07.989
Where's my plate?

00:40:08.615 --> 00:40:10.617
Your mom threw it out when she stopped by.

00:40:10.700 --> 00:40:11.826
It was chipped.

00:40:11.910 --> 00:40:13.202
My mom was here?

00:40:13.286 --> 00:40:15.371
Yeah, couldn't you tell from the fridge?

00:40:15.455 --> 00:40:17.624
It's chock-full of new side dishes.

00:40:18.374 --> 00:40:20.168
Our domestic fairy, Lady Choi Eun-hee,

00:40:20.251 --> 00:40:21.836
restocked it before leaving.

00:40:24.339 --> 00:40:27.133
Why would my mom touch my things?

00:40:27.216 --> 00:40:28.301
What?

00:40:28.968 --> 00:40:31.054
What's up? What's wrong?

00:40:31.137 --> 00:40:33.139
Why would you let
my mom throw out my plate?

00:40:33.890 --> 00:40:37.644
Well, she wanted to toss it
because it was chipped and cracked…

00:40:37.727 --> 00:40:40.563
That's Hyo-min's favorite plate.

00:40:41.731 --> 00:40:42.941
I know that.

00:40:43.775 --> 00:40:45.401
But it was her mom…

00:40:46.069 --> 00:40:48.488
Hey, Hyo-min! Where are you going?

00:41:00.750 --> 00:41:02.085
Hyo-min.

00:41:02.710 --> 00:41:03.920
Did something happen?

00:41:04.003 --> 00:41:05.254
Why did you toss it?

00:41:05.338 --> 00:41:06.255
What?

00:41:06.339 --> 00:41:07.840
Why did you toss it?

00:41:07.924 --> 00:41:09.968
Do only perfect things deserve to exist?

00:41:12.387 --> 00:41:14.305
What are you talking about?

00:41:14.389 --> 00:41:17.141
Why would you toss it
just because it was chipped?

00:41:17.225 --> 00:41:19.560
Are you talking about the plate?

00:41:20.228 --> 00:41:21.479
There are plenty of good plates.

00:41:21.562 --> 00:41:24.440
Why use a chipped one
and invite misfortune?

00:41:24.524 --> 00:41:26.192
I'll buy you another one just like it.

00:41:26.275 --> 00:41:27.318
No.

00:41:28.611 --> 00:41:29.862
Not the plate.

00:41:31.447 --> 00:41:32.782
I'm talking about my sister.

00:41:32.865 --> 00:41:34.033
Is Hyo-min here?

00:41:35.493 --> 00:41:37.829
You would've thrown me away
if I also had a disability.

00:41:37.912 --> 00:41:41.791
Just like how you tossed out
my sister and my plate.

00:41:41.874 --> 00:41:43.042
Hyo-min…

00:41:44.335 --> 00:41:45.253
What are you talking--

00:41:45.336 --> 00:41:47.046
I broke up with Seong-chan.

00:41:48.172 --> 00:41:49.048
Why?

00:41:49.132 --> 00:41:51.759
He broke up with me
because of my disabled sister.

00:41:51.843 --> 00:41:52.885
What?

00:41:54.012 --> 00:41:55.555
What sort of nonsense is that?

00:41:55.638 --> 00:41:56.639
What's wrong?

00:41:57.306 --> 00:41:59.142
You and Seong-chan are
just birds of a feather.

00:41:59.225 --> 00:42:01.102
Hyo-min, that's enough.

00:42:01.936 --> 00:42:04.105
You didn't even act like this
as a teenager.

00:42:04.605 --> 00:42:06.441
Don't come to my house
without my permission.

00:42:06.524 --> 00:42:09.986
And don't toss out
my things without my permission.

00:42:27.754 --> 00:42:28.838
How pathetic…

00:42:30.298 --> 00:42:33.092
Mad at one thing, lashing out at another.

00:42:41.934 --> 00:42:44.020
COURT IN SESSION

00:42:44.103 --> 00:42:45.772
{\an8}Did you assess
the plaintiff's mental state?

00:42:45.855 --> 00:42:47.607
{\an8}FIRST HEARING OF NO-COLLISION CASE

00:42:47.690 --> 00:42:49.067
- Yes.
- And your findings?

00:42:49.150 --> 00:42:50.818
{\an8}He has a low EQ

00:42:50.902 --> 00:42:52.278
{\an8}and has separation anxiety

00:42:52.361 --> 00:42:54.155
{\an8}due to his strong
attachment to his mother.

00:42:55.239 --> 00:42:56.657
{\an8}I believe it has progressed

00:42:56.741 --> 00:42:59.660
{\an8}to psychological enmeshment
with his mother.

00:42:59.744 --> 00:43:01.788
Can you explain
"psychological enmeshment"?

00:43:01.871 --> 00:43:03.039
Simply put,

00:43:03.664 --> 00:43:05.750
the child cannot make
independent judgments

00:43:05.833 --> 00:43:08.669
that go against
the mother's words and actions.

00:43:08.753 --> 00:43:10.046
{\an8}Look here!

00:43:10.129 --> 00:43:12.215
As if making my son
a damn cripple wasn't enough,

00:43:12.298 --> 00:43:15.635
{\an8}now you want to make him into some moron?

00:43:15.718 --> 00:43:17.720
Plaintiff, quiet down.

00:43:17.804 --> 00:43:19.555
But Your Honor--

00:43:19.639 --> 00:43:21.349
You'll only hurt our case.

00:43:24.477 --> 00:43:28.106
This is how Ms. Lee Sang-mi, his mother,
reacted at the time of the accident.

00:43:28.189 --> 00:43:29.524
Please play the video.

00:43:42.203 --> 00:43:43.329
How?

00:43:43.412 --> 00:43:45.248
How could you?

00:43:46.666 --> 00:43:48.376
What do I do?

00:43:51.254 --> 00:43:52.588
Is she insane?

00:43:55.258 --> 00:43:57.802
Can you assess
Ms. Lee's mental state there?

00:43:57.885 --> 00:44:00.138
{\an8}She seems to be
in a state of extreme shock.

00:44:00.221 --> 00:44:02.181
{\an8}Even the witness statements mention

00:44:02.265 --> 00:44:04.225
the plaintiff's mother
screaming and overreacting--

00:44:04.308 --> 00:44:05.977
{\an8}"Overreacting"?

00:44:06.060 --> 00:44:08.688
What sort of mother remains calm
after a truck hits their kid?

00:44:08.771 --> 00:44:10.148
Please try to calm down.

00:44:10.815 --> 00:44:12.108
Yes, that's it.

00:44:12.191 --> 00:44:16.112
When Ms. Lee saw the plaintiff
collapse in front of the delivery truck,

00:44:16.195 --> 00:44:18.239
{\an8}she was certain a collision had occurred.

00:44:19.115 --> 00:44:21.951
{\an8}And when the plaintiff, who was
psychologically enmeshed with his mother,

00:44:22.034 --> 00:44:24.078
observed her reaction,

00:44:24.162 --> 00:44:26.747
could he have believed
he was actually hit by the truck?

00:44:27.456 --> 00:44:28.958
{\an8}Yes, that is possible.

00:44:29.041 --> 00:44:31.711
Then, that false belief

00:44:31.794 --> 00:44:35.214
could have caused
his current medical condition, correct?

00:44:36.799 --> 00:44:38.509
I believe it is possible.

00:44:40.469 --> 00:44:41.554
No further questions.

00:44:44.182 --> 00:44:45.349
{\an8}All right.

00:44:45.433 --> 00:44:48.102
The plaintiff's counsel
may now cross-examine.

00:44:52.732 --> 00:44:53.816
Well…

00:44:54.525 --> 00:44:55.568
just now,

00:44:56.068 --> 00:44:59.864
{\an8}you claimed the plaintiff was
psychologically enmeshed with his mother.

00:45:00.364 --> 00:45:03.910
Can you diagnose that
with such a brief mental evaluation?

00:45:03.993 --> 00:45:05.786
There is one test

00:45:05.870 --> 00:45:09.165
{\an8}that has been proven
to diagnose enmeshment the best.

00:45:09.248 --> 00:45:12.126
After the child is asked a question
that matches their intelligence level,

00:45:12.210 --> 00:45:16.005
the mother deliberately gives
the wrong answer before the child answers.

00:45:16.088 --> 00:45:21.677
For our test, we drew
six numbered lines on a piece of paper.

00:45:21.761 --> 00:45:23.846
Number three was drawn the longest,

00:45:23.930 --> 00:45:26.182
with number five coming in second.

00:45:26.807 --> 00:45:30.144
We then asked the child
which line was the longest,

00:45:30.228 --> 00:45:33.898
and before they answered, their mother
deliberately gave the wrong answer.

00:45:34.857 --> 00:45:38.110
I think number five is the longest.
What do you think, Ri-a?

00:45:38.194 --> 00:45:41.280
Most kids around Min-guk's age

00:45:41.364 --> 00:45:42.531
gave an answer

00:45:42.615 --> 00:45:44.784
- they believed to be right…
- You think it's number three?

00:45:44.867 --> 00:45:47.036
…in their own way, actively or passively.

00:45:47.536 --> 00:45:50.665
- A select few gave the same answer…
- I think number five is the longest.

00:45:50.748 --> 00:45:52.667
- …as their mother…
- It's number three.

00:45:52.750 --> 00:45:54.126
- …but later confessed…
- I see.

00:45:54.210 --> 00:45:55.419
…to lying when we were alone.

00:45:55.503 --> 00:45:56.671
Is three the longest?

00:45:56.754 --> 00:45:58.381
- However…
- Do you think that's the longest?

00:45:58.464 --> 00:46:00.216
…Min-guk was different.

00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:03.886
I think number five is the longest.
What do you think?

00:46:06.472 --> 00:46:07.723
Number five.

00:46:09.016 --> 00:46:12.561
When Min-guk's mother told him
number five was the longest,

00:46:12.645 --> 00:46:14.105
he gave the same answer,

00:46:14.188 --> 00:46:16.315
and we couldn't detect a lie.

00:46:16.399 --> 00:46:20.069
Thus, even with questions he was
perfectly capable of answering himself,

00:46:20.152 --> 00:46:25.199
he accepted his mother's wrong answer
as the correct one.

00:46:28.286 --> 00:46:31.914
What was your profession
before Min-guk was born?

00:46:33.374 --> 00:46:34.458
I was an accountant.

00:46:34.542 --> 00:46:36.877
Why did you quit such a good job?

00:46:38.462 --> 00:46:41.799
The workload was too intense
to juggle with childcare.

00:46:42.633 --> 00:46:44.135
Does your family live nearby?

00:46:44.218 --> 00:46:46.637
No, they're all in Canada.

00:46:46.721 --> 00:46:48.597
When did you see them last?

00:46:48.681 --> 00:46:52.018
{\an8}Objection, Your Honor. Relevance?

00:46:52.101 --> 00:46:55.021
The plaintiff's mental state
is the core of this case.

00:46:55.104 --> 00:46:58.983
And Ms. Lee would've had
the biggest impact on the plaintiff.

00:46:59.066 --> 00:47:02.194
Assessing her mental state
is highly relevant to this case.

00:47:02.278 --> 00:47:04.697
Yes. This seems relevant.

00:47:05.197 --> 00:47:06.866
The witness may answer.

00:47:10.870 --> 00:47:12.997
It was around Min-guk's first birthday.

00:47:13.956 --> 00:47:15.416
Do you see your friends often?

00:47:16.042 --> 00:47:16.917
No.

00:47:17.543 --> 00:47:18.669
When was the last time?

00:47:18.753 --> 00:47:20.963
{\an8}I haven't since I got pregnant
with Min-guk.

00:47:21.047 --> 00:47:22.715
{\an8}Your husband is a famous doctor, correct?

00:47:23.716 --> 00:47:25.760
- Yes.
- And not currently in Korea, correct?

00:47:25.843 --> 00:47:26.844
Yes.

00:47:26.927 --> 00:47:29.388
He's in a doctoral program
at Johns Hopkins.

00:47:30.056 --> 00:47:31.349
To summarize,

00:47:32.183 --> 00:47:36.103
after the plaintiff was born,
you gave up your career,

00:47:36.187 --> 00:47:39.982
became isolated from friends and family,
and your husband remained busy.

00:47:40.066 --> 00:47:42.735
Min-guk must have been your whole world.

00:47:42.818 --> 00:47:44.570
What are you getting at?

00:47:45.363 --> 00:47:46.739
Did you breastfeed him?

00:47:46.822 --> 00:47:48.699
Objection, Your Honor. Relevance?

00:47:48.783 --> 00:47:50.785
- It is relevant.
- Let's hear it first.

00:47:52.161 --> 00:47:53.704
{\an8}The witness may answer.

00:47:58.334 --> 00:47:59.460
Yes.

00:48:00.086 --> 00:48:01.170
When was he weaned off?

00:48:04.006 --> 00:48:04.965
Please answer.

00:48:07.968 --> 00:48:10.054
He… hasn't been yet.

00:48:10.137 --> 00:48:12.056
- What?
- What…

00:48:12.139 --> 00:48:15.101
You're still breastfeeding
a 51-month-old child.

00:48:17.228 --> 00:48:19.855
Have you ever sent
the plaintiff to kindergarten?

00:48:20.481 --> 00:48:22.858
- Yes.
- Can you specify the time period?

00:48:22.942 --> 00:48:24.527
For about a week.

00:48:24.610 --> 00:48:25.986
Why such a short amount of time?

00:48:26.070 --> 00:48:27.905
Min-guk had trouble adjusting

00:48:27.988 --> 00:48:29.532
and hated being apart from me--

00:48:29.615 --> 00:48:33.160
Your Honor. We'd like to submit
the kindergarten's testimony as evidence.

00:48:36.747 --> 00:48:38.290
According to the testimony,

00:48:38.374 --> 00:48:41.043
the plaintiff initially struggled
with his separation from his mother

00:48:41.127 --> 00:48:43.796
but soon showed
notable signs of adjusting.

00:48:44.755 --> 00:48:49.385
However, he stopped attending
without any prior notice.

00:48:51.011 --> 00:48:55.349
Did you fear the plaintiff
would grow into an independent individual?

00:48:56.183 --> 00:48:59.103
Because in doing so,
it would deny your existence?

00:48:59.979 --> 00:49:02.356
You don't know anything about this.

00:49:07.069 --> 00:49:09.196
These are the plaintiff's medical records.

00:49:10.156 --> 00:49:14.243
The plaintiff visited the hospital often.
Was it for a specific health issue?

00:49:14.994 --> 00:49:16.871
What does that have to do with this?

00:49:18.664 --> 00:49:21.959
Frequent visits with symptoms
but no prescription records.

00:49:24.628 --> 00:49:28.549
According to a pediatrician, there are
two possibilities in this scenario.

00:49:28.632 --> 00:49:32.136
First, Munchausen syndrome.
Second, hypochondria.

00:49:32.219 --> 00:49:33.471
In other words,

00:49:34.305 --> 00:49:36.599
the plaintiff was already
in a compromised mental state

00:49:36.682 --> 00:49:39.185
due to Ms. Lee's parenting style.

00:49:39.935 --> 00:49:41.979
- He had a mental illness.
- How dare you!

00:49:42.480 --> 00:49:45.024
What are you trying to say here?
You know nothing!

00:49:46.066 --> 00:49:49.195
You know nothing…

00:49:51.155 --> 00:49:52.656
I just…

00:49:53.491 --> 00:49:56.744
gave everything I had
to raise my Min-guk well!

00:49:59.914 --> 00:50:03.292
I only loved him and protected him.

00:50:03.375 --> 00:50:05.294
Yes, I'm sure you tried your best

00:50:05.377 --> 00:50:07.004
to fill that void inside you.

00:50:07.630 --> 00:50:11.175
{\an8}And that selfish effort led
to obsession and smothering behavior,

00:50:12.009 --> 00:50:13.260
before it became the poison

00:50:13.344 --> 00:50:16.096
that ruined Min-guk like this, did it not?

00:50:19.183 --> 00:50:22.311
As if ruining your child was not enough,
now you blame others?

00:50:22.394 --> 00:50:24.647
Do you think you deserve
to be his mother after all this?

00:50:24.730 --> 00:50:25.856
Objection, Your Honor.

00:50:25.940 --> 00:50:27.900
- The counsel is--
- Counsel.

00:50:36.617 --> 00:50:39.370
The plaintiff could remain disabled
for his whole life.

00:50:39.453 --> 00:50:40.412
And that…

00:50:42.039 --> 00:50:44.750
was caused
by your obsession and smothering,

00:50:44.833 --> 00:50:46.502
not because of the defendant.

00:51:24.164 --> 00:51:25.666
Did you have to say all that?

00:51:26.292 --> 00:51:28.210
You acted like you wanted to hurt her.

00:51:30.546 --> 00:51:32.214
Did you have to twist the knife,

00:51:32.298 --> 00:51:35.342
making it sound like she ruined
her beloved son's life?

00:51:35.426 --> 00:51:37.636
Yes, that's how she'll realize it.

00:51:39.013 --> 00:51:42.057
She lived with the delusion
that she was being a good mother

00:51:43.058 --> 00:51:45.978
when, in reality, she just used her child

00:51:46.061 --> 00:51:47.438
to fill her own emptiness.

00:51:48.105 --> 00:51:51.775
Min-guk's mother loves him
more than she loves herself.

00:51:51.859 --> 00:51:54.778
She did her best and devoted herself
to expressing that love.

00:51:54.862 --> 00:51:56.363
Her love was a bit excessive,

00:51:57.531 --> 00:51:59.283
but don't deny the intentions behind it.

00:52:00.534 --> 00:52:03.621
Don't be so sure
that all mothers are devoted to their kids

00:52:03.704 --> 00:52:06.707
and selflessly love their kids
more than themselves.

00:52:06.790 --> 00:52:08.375
Mothers are just people.

00:52:08.459 --> 00:52:09.501
And people

00:52:10.419 --> 00:52:12.463
are selfish to the point of cruelty.

00:52:13.672 --> 00:52:16.634
In this world, there are people
who don't want to become mothers

00:52:16.717 --> 00:52:18.427
and those who should never be mothers.

00:52:18.510 --> 00:52:19.553
I know.

00:52:22.097 --> 00:52:23.098
I do.

00:52:24.058 --> 00:52:27.478
Verbal blows are fine,
but the wrong hit could be fatal.

00:52:27.978 --> 00:52:29.980
The truth can be poison
if it's used like one.

00:52:31.106 --> 00:52:32.608
Ms. Kang, tread carefully.

00:52:42.409 --> 00:52:43.952
Of course, a lawyer throws verbal blows.

00:52:44.036 --> 00:52:46.246
Should they hold back to spare feelings?

00:52:46.914 --> 00:52:50.626
I mean, it's fine to strike verbally
to subdue your opponent,

00:52:50.709 --> 00:52:53.170
but you can't stab their hearts like that.

00:52:53.253 --> 00:52:56.382
When it comes to scorching words,
you're no joke, either.

00:52:56.465 --> 00:52:57.633
Yes, right.

00:52:58.175 --> 00:52:59.176
If she wasn't a softie,

00:52:59.259 --> 00:53:01.595
Yoon Seok-hoon would be no match for her.

00:53:01.679 --> 00:53:02.846
It's a gift.

00:53:03.514 --> 00:53:05.349
And I was the one who discovered it.

00:53:06.141 --> 00:53:08.769
I played a big role
in her becoming a lawyer.

00:53:09.395 --> 00:53:11.689
Your mom is a renowned lawyer,

00:53:12.314 --> 00:53:14.149
and your dad is a famous judge.

00:53:14.233 --> 00:53:16.777
You were born with legal genes.

00:53:16.860 --> 00:53:18.737
Why do you refuse to become a lawyer?

00:53:19.238 --> 00:53:20.280
It's not fun.

00:53:20.948 --> 00:53:23.158
Who chooses a career
based on whether it's fun?

00:53:23.242 --> 00:53:24.868
Are you in a rebellious phase?

00:53:24.952 --> 00:53:27.454
Are you rebelling
against your mom or something?

00:53:27.538 --> 00:53:29.790
Why are you piling on too?

00:53:30.290 --> 00:53:33.377
She's going through enough
with her pressure-induced dyslexia.

00:53:34.878 --> 00:53:36.004
Poor baby.

00:53:37.881 --> 00:53:39.383
You call that suffering?

00:53:39.967 --> 00:53:42.136
She gets to slack off
all day because of it.

00:53:45.347 --> 00:53:46.265
Dad!

00:53:47.349 --> 00:53:48.475
Hey.

00:53:49.518 --> 00:53:50.477
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:53:50.561 --> 00:53:52.312
Hey, there. Where are you three off to?

00:53:52.396 --> 00:53:53.731
Our place.

00:53:53.814 --> 00:53:56.567
Why do you three always gather

00:53:56.650 --> 00:53:58.402
at her teeny-tiny house every day?

00:53:58.485 --> 00:53:59.820
It's cozy.

00:53:59.903 --> 00:54:00.988
Where are you going?

00:54:01.071 --> 00:54:03.449
I'm having dinner
with the other factory workers.

00:54:03.532 --> 00:54:04.533
Did you all eat?

00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:07.494
- We bought street food.
- All right.

00:54:07.578 --> 00:54:09.288
Have fun, and be nice to each other.

00:54:09.371 --> 00:54:10.247
Go on now.

00:54:10.873 --> 00:54:11.790
- Go on.
- Goodbye.

00:54:14.460 --> 00:54:16.587
Your daughter looks nothing like you.

00:54:16.670 --> 00:54:18.046
I know, right?

00:54:21.049 --> 00:54:22.968
Dad, you should go see a doctor.

00:54:23.469 --> 00:54:25.971
Don't worry about me. Go on now.

00:54:26.054 --> 00:54:27.014
Go.

00:54:28.724 --> 00:54:29.767
- Chang-bae.
- What?

00:54:29.850 --> 00:54:31.727
Did you really sign the statement?

00:54:31.810 --> 00:54:32.728
I did.

00:54:32.811 --> 00:54:34.813
The medical expenses are chump change.

00:54:34.897 --> 00:54:36.774
Why would you sign it just for that?

00:54:36.857 --> 00:54:40.319
The boss didn't sign up
for workers' compensation.

00:54:41.069 --> 00:54:46.074
He said the fines and surcharges
would be astronomical if we filed for it.

00:54:46.158 --> 00:54:48.660
He was bawling about how he would need
to shut down the factory.

00:54:48.744 --> 00:54:49.912
What choice did I have?

00:54:50.662 --> 00:54:53.123
I can't have people
lose their jobs because of me.

00:55:08.931 --> 00:55:11.266
They fit perfectly.

00:55:11.850 --> 00:55:14.520
- They don't look like your mom's clothes.
- Really?

00:55:14.603 --> 00:55:15.854
I feel a bit awkward.

00:55:16.688 --> 00:55:18.482
No, it looks good.

00:55:19.399 --> 00:55:21.276
- You can do this, right?
- Of course.

00:55:41.255 --> 00:55:42.673
The factory manager's accident

00:55:42.756 --> 00:55:45.592
was undeniably a workplace injury
caused by outdated machinery

00:55:45.676 --> 00:55:48.011
that should've been replaced beforehand.

00:55:48.095 --> 00:55:51.139
He already signed
a statement taking responsibility.

00:55:51.223 --> 00:55:52.266
It's settled already.

00:55:52.349 --> 00:55:54.142
Statements signed under coercion
are invalid.

00:55:54.226 --> 00:55:57.145
Failure to report an occupational injury
and neglecting equipment defects

00:55:57.229 --> 00:56:00.649
could result in imprisonment for violating
the Occupational Safety and Health Act.

00:56:00.732 --> 00:56:04.653
Furthermore, attempting
to shift the blame onto the worker

00:56:04.736 --> 00:56:07.322
may constitute coercion
and be punishable under criminal law.

00:56:07.406 --> 00:56:09.283
You little brats.

00:56:09.366 --> 00:56:12.035
How dare you meddle in grown-up matters!

00:56:12.536 --> 00:56:14.705
It's not too late to report
the industrial accident

00:56:14.788 --> 00:56:16.623
and compensate
for medical bills and damages.

00:56:16.707 --> 00:56:18.041
If you don't,

00:56:19.001 --> 00:56:20.460
we will sue.

00:56:20.544 --> 00:56:22.087
What? Sue?

00:56:22.921 --> 00:56:24.882
You must be kidding me right now.

00:56:24.965 --> 00:56:25.966
So what?

00:56:26.049 --> 00:56:28.844
You'll see what's next in the courtroom.

00:56:28.927 --> 00:56:31.388
If the company fails to compensate,
we will seize your assets

00:56:31.471 --> 00:56:33.557
and immediately file
a lawsuit for damages.

00:56:33.640 --> 00:56:36.268
For coercing and violating
the Occupational Safety and Health Act,

00:56:36.351 --> 00:56:38.562
you will be sent to jail.

00:56:38.645 --> 00:56:39.855
And one more thing.

00:56:40.522 --> 00:56:42.858
The manager resigned
because of the accident,

00:56:42.941 --> 00:56:44.985
but he hasn't received
his severance pay yet.

00:56:45.068 --> 00:56:47.070
Well, that is because…

00:56:47.738 --> 00:56:50.073
The factory is going through
a tough time right now.

00:56:50.157 --> 00:56:52.367
There's a luxury foreign car
parked outside.

00:56:52.451 --> 00:56:53.744
Isn't that yours, Mister?

00:56:54.244 --> 00:56:57.956
The Labor Standards Act states that
severance pay must be paid within 14 days.

00:56:58.040 --> 00:57:00.792
If you violate that,
you could face imprisonment.

00:57:00.876 --> 00:57:04.212
If you don't pay the severance
and compensation immediately…

00:57:06.965 --> 00:57:09.384
we'll report the unpaid wages,
claim delayed interest,

00:57:09.468 --> 00:57:11.595
and pursue
a provisional seizure of assets.

00:57:12.262 --> 00:57:14.514
- Well done!
- Yes!

00:57:33.617 --> 00:57:35.077
You were amazing back then, Hyo-min.

00:57:35.160 --> 00:57:36.745
Well, you did hear things growing up.

00:57:36.828 --> 00:57:38.705
She probably got lessons
from inside the womb.

00:57:38.789 --> 00:57:41.708
Her mom worked as a lawyer
until she had to give birth.

00:57:43.085 --> 00:57:45.337
Dad's boss might have
even been hospitalized from stress.

00:57:45.420 --> 00:57:47.464
He refused to pay until the very end,

00:57:47.547 --> 00:57:49.466
but when his accounts
and assets were seized,

00:57:49.549 --> 00:57:51.093
he offered land instead of money…

00:57:51.176 --> 00:57:52.636
- In Gwacheon.
- In Gwacheon.

00:57:52.719 --> 00:57:56.348
That part still gives me chills
every time I hear it.

00:57:56.431 --> 00:57:57.557
Back then,

00:57:58.600 --> 00:58:02.229
that land's value was not even worth
an eighth of what your father was due,

00:58:02.312 --> 00:58:05.148
and we tried so hard to stop him,
but your father said…

00:58:07.943 --> 00:58:10.696
"Leave it.
It might pay for some taffy later."

00:58:13.865 --> 00:58:17.160
I sometimes thought my dad's kindness
was actually incompetence,

00:58:17.244 --> 00:58:19.246
but it paid off for him in the end.

00:58:19.329 --> 00:58:21.748
That's how our Ji-eun is able to pursue

00:58:21.832 --> 00:58:24.793
a career in the arts
without worrying about money.

00:58:28.880 --> 00:58:29.923
Yes, hello.

00:58:31.675 --> 00:58:32.676
Right now?

00:58:33.176 --> 00:58:34.219
No, it's fine.

00:58:34.302 --> 00:58:35.846
It's easier to do it at the office.

00:58:35.929 --> 00:58:37.222
Okay.

00:58:38.932 --> 00:58:40.267
Thanks for the meal.

00:58:40.350 --> 00:58:41.768
They need you back at the office?

00:58:41.852 --> 00:58:42.936
Yeah.

00:58:43.020 --> 00:58:44.980
I thought it was odd you came home early.

00:58:46.690 --> 00:58:47.899
I know, right?

00:59:27.731 --> 00:59:30.484
I'm so sleepy!

00:59:30.984 --> 00:59:32.986
I wonder if there's an energy drink.

00:59:33.945 --> 00:59:35.030
There isn't any.

00:59:35.781 --> 00:59:37.824
Should I drink coffee?

00:59:40.535 --> 00:59:42.204
The coffee smells nice.

00:59:44.247 --> 00:59:47.042
Can't you make me a cup as well?

00:59:55.842 --> 00:59:57.469
Earlier at the courthouse,

00:59:58.637 --> 01:00:00.305
I was out of line.

01:00:02.265 --> 01:00:03.225
I'm sorry.

01:00:06.228 --> 01:00:08.230
Australia officially replaced

01:00:08.313 --> 01:00:12.067
the term "custody" with "parenting order."

01:00:12.150 --> 01:00:16.488
The term "custody" implied
a sense of ownership.

01:00:16.988 --> 01:00:19.825
"Children are not property
the parents can own"

01:00:20.325 --> 01:00:21.868
was the reasoning behind it.

01:00:23.745 --> 01:00:25.247
That's good reasoning.

01:00:27.374 --> 01:00:28.375
I…

01:00:30.043 --> 01:00:31.670
have a twin sister.

01:00:33.547 --> 01:00:35.507
I thought you were an only child.

01:00:36.675 --> 01:00:38.260
My sister is hearing-impaired,

01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:41.471
and because my aunt and uncle
are also hearing-impaired,

01:00:41.555 --> 01:00:42.722
they adopted her.

01:00:43.932 --> 01:00:45.142
My mom…

01:00:46.226 --> 01:00:47.769
was a perfectionist.

01:00:49.855 --> 01:00:51.481
I think she saw my sister's disability

01:00:51.565 --> 01:00:53.900
as one of her flaws.

01:00:54.734 --> 01:00:56.278
Because it was genetic.

01:00:57.404 --> 01:01:00.949
It seemed like she was trying
to wash away that flaw through me.

01:01:01.575 --> 01:01:04.369
She went above and beyond
to do her best in raising me.

01:01:05.162 --> 01:01:07.330
She even somewhat gave up her career.

01:01:11.835 --> 01:01:13.545
My mom was also a lawyer.

01:01:14.045 --> 01:01:17.340
Everyone said her talent
was too good to waste.

01:01:17.424 --> 01:01:20.510
I'm sure she wanted
to be rewarded in turn.

01:01:22.804 --> 01:01:26.308
I think that was also
a heavy burden for me.

01:01:27.058 --> 01:01:30.145
I ended up having a breakdown
in my senior year of high school.

01:01:30.228 --> 01:01:33.481
I developed dyslexia
and repeated my senior year three times.

01:01:34.232 --> 01:01:36.902
You entered university in 2017,
and you're 28 now.

01:01:37.777 --> 01:01:39.154
Your age doesn't match up.

01:01:39.821 --> 01:01:42.866
I was in a gifted program
and skipped two grades when I was younger.

01:01:46.119 --> 01:01:49.664
My genius was a product
of nurture rather than nature.

01:01:50.665 --> 01:01:52.083
The result of my mom's efforts.

01:01:53.710 --> 01:01:56.838
Earlier in court,

01:01:57.839 --> 01:01:59.966
it felt like you were yelling at my mom.

01:02:01.468 --> 01:02:03.178
"Mothers are just people."

01:02:03.803 --> 01:02:07.224
"And people are selfish
to the point of cruelty."

01:02:09.476 --> 01:02:12.187
Those words provide me with solace
for some reason.

01:02:13.313 --> 01:02:15.273
Accepting it helped me understand.

01:02:17.025 --> 01:02:18.109
And forgive.

01:02:23.365 --> 01:02:25.951
{\an8}FIVE YEARS AGO

01:02:27.702 --> 01:02:29.829
{\an8}- Welcome back.
- Hello.

01:02:30.330 --> 01:02:31.373
What is all that?

01:02:31.456 --> 01:02:33.458
{\an8}I think a cat tore it up.

01:02:33.541 --> 01:02:35.752
You don't need to help. Go inside.

01:02:35.835 --> 01:02:37.545
- Okay.
- Goodness.

01:02:40.340 --> 01:02:41.758
Wait, what's this?

01:02:43.301 --> 01:02:44.469
Hold on…

01:02:55.689 --> 01:02:58.233
Welcome home. Go and wash up.

01:03:02.028 --> 01:03:03.071
Are you pregnant?

01:03:05.907 --> 01:03:07.492
What's this out of the blue?

01:03:08.076 --> 01:03:09.327
Go and wash up.

01:03:11.621 --> 01:03:12.872
I saw the pregnancy test.

01:03:17.085 --> 01:03:18.086
The green onions…

01:03:18.920 --> 01:03:20.046
Where could they be?

01:03:23.341 --> 01:03:24.259
You're not?

01:03:24.342 --> 01:03:25.635
No.

01:03:25.719 --> 01:03:27.178
Where could the green onions be?

01:03:29.639 --> 01:03:31.391
- They're over here.
- What?

01:03:32.809 --> 01:03:33.977
Here.

01:03:34.561 --> 01:03:36.062
My goodness, where is my head?

01:03:39.024 --> 01:03:40.692
Have you been to the OB-GYN?

01:03:42.319 --> 01:03:43.486
Yeah.

01:03:43.570 --> 01:03:46.031
What did they say?

01:03:47.198 --> 01:03:48.116
I'm not.

01:03:53.038 --> 01:03:55.290
Were you never pregnant or…

01:03:55.373 --> 01:03:56.875
did something happen later on?

01:04:04.591 --> 01:04:06.092
When you went to see your family--

01:04:06.176 --> 01:04:09.220
I don't want to talk about this anymore.

01:04:11.056 --> 01:04:13.141
We had an agreement when we got married.

01:04:15.143 --> 01:04:17.604
We agreed to live happily together
without a baby.

01:04:21.900 --> 01:04:24.194
I haven't cooked in a while.
It might not be good.

01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:31.242
I'll go and shower.

01:04:46.925 --> 01:04:51.054
A mother is still a woman and a person.

01:04:52.138 --> 01:04:54.724
That's why they're capable
of making selfish choices.

01:04:57.894 --> 01:04:59.020
Will accepting that…

01:05:01.398 --> 01:05:02.524
help understand

01:05:03.441 --> 01:05:04.859
and resolve any resentment?

01:05:10.990 --> 01:05:12.367
In my head, I understand…

01:05:14.953 --> 01:05:16.287
but my heart still hasn't…

01:05:22.127 --> 01:05:23.128
Excuse me.

01:05:24.629 --> 01:05:28.133
Thank you for the coffee.

01:05:29.592 --> 01:05:30.468
Sure.

01:05:52.031 --> 01:05:53.199
Hash!

01:05:53.741 --> 01:05:55.201
Careful. Here!

01:06:06.212 --> 01:06:07.338
Dinner's ready.

01:06:08.256 --> 01:06:09.174
Okay.

01:06:09.674 --> 01:06:11.759
I guess dinner is ready. Let's go inside.

01:06:30.820 --> 01:06:32.947
Our little Miracle must be starving.

01:06:33.031 --> 01:06:34.157
Let's enjoy this meal.

01:07:29.045 --> 01:07:32.131
BEYOND THE BAR

01:07:32.298 --> 01:07:35.009
I want to file a defamation lawsuit.
My housekeeper.

01:07:35.093 --> 01:07:37.178
{\an8}It got to a point where checking her

01:07:37.262 --> 01:07:39.264
{\an8}was the first thing I would do
whenever I was there,

01:07:39.347 --> 01:07:41.266
{\an8}wondering how badly
he had beaten her this time…

01:07:41.349 --> 01:07:43.017
{\an8}I could see the truth in her eyes.

01:07:43.101 --> 01:07:44.644
{\an8}Are we judging the truth by her gaze?

01:07:44.727 --> 01:07:47.230
{\an8}Did Mr. Yoon seriously take that case?

01:07:47.313 --> 01:07:50.733
{\an8}And it looks like they're acquaintances.
It seemed pretty intense.

01:07:51.276 --> 01:07:53.611
{\an8}And you stabbed our client in the back
to give her more ammo!

01:07:53.695 --> 01:07:55.196
{\an8}Absolutely ridiculous.

01:07:55.280 --> 01:07:58.950
{\an8}This devil really hit In-yeong!

01:07:59.033 --> 01:08:02.620
{\an8}Do you do it to pick on the weak
and protect the powerful?

01:08:04.038 --> 01:08:05.290
{\an8}I'll report him myself.

01:08:10.044 --> 01:08:12.046
