00:00:30.655 --> 00:00:31.865
Hello, Ms. Choi.

00:00:31.948 --> 00:00:34.492
Ms. Ryu, I'm just leaving now.

00:00:34.576 --> 00:00:36.995
Do you know Ms. Cheon Sang-yeon,
by any chance?

00:00:40.957 --> 00:00:44.127
-Cheon Sang-yeon of Swallow Pictures?
-Yes.

00:00:48.256 --> 00:00:51.342
Yeah, I know her.
Who doesn't know Cheon Sang-yeon?

00:00:51.843 --> 00:00:54.763
I mean, do you know her personally?

00:00:56.681 --> 00:00:57.932
Personally?

00:00:59.934 --> 00:01:01.186
A little. Ages ago.

00:01:01.811 --> 00:01:04.230
It didn't seem like "a little, ages ago."

00:01:04.731 --> 00:01:07.692
You didn't watch the Baeksang Arts Awards
last night, did you?

00:01:08.234 --> 00:01:09.819
-No, I didn't.
-You should.

00:01:10.403 --> 00:01:13.490
Watch Ms. Cheon's acceptance speech
for Special Achievements in Film.

00:01:14.199 --> 00:01:15.492
Why? What did she say?

00:01:15.992 --> 00:01:18.953
Hello. I'm Cheon Sang-yeon,
the CEO of Swallow Pictures.

00:01:22.207 --> 00:01:23.041
Thank you.

00:01:25.502 --> 00:01:31.633
All movies are the fruits of
the talent and passion of their creators.

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.427
If I, as a producer,

00:01:35.136 --> 00:01:37.347
can claim any credit in the process,

00:01:38.681 --> 00:01:40.683
I would like to gather all of that credit

00:01:41.643 --> 00:01:45.772
and dedicate it to the person who's had
the greatest influence on my life.

00:01:46.272 --> 00:01:48.983
My dear friend Ryu Eun-jung.

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.444
I want to thank you.

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:55.490
…had the greatest influence on my life.
My dear friend…

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:00.036
Ryu Eun-jung.

00:02:05.792 --> 00:02:06.876
What a load of crap.

00:02:08.837 --> 00:02:10.380
I hate that you're fine.

00:02:13.716 --> 00:02:16.010
I want to see you ruined, like me.

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:22.911
YOU AND EVERYTHING ELSE

00:03:24.704 --> 00:03:25.747
You severed ties?

00:03:26.247 --> 00:03:27.081
Yes.

00:03:30.877 --> 00:03:31.794
It's just

00:03:32.295 --> 00:03:36.466
the expression "severed ties" is something
you only read about in books.

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:39.886
Why did you sever ties?

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:45.266
It's a long story.

00:03:46.392 --> 00:03:47.352
Find anything good?

00:03:49.771 --> 00:03:50.605
No.

00:03:51.814 --> 00:03:53.775
I've been looking hard,

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.902
but no books have blown me away.

00:03:55.985 --> 00:03:57.153
Me neither.

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:00.698
I've looked through
entire libraries lately,

00:04:00.782 --> 00:04:02.367
but nothing has caught my eye.

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:03.493
Ms. Ryu.

00:04:06.412 --> 00:04:09.207
What's the story behind
you and Ms. Cheon severing ties?

00:04:17.507 --> 00:04:18.758
Would it work as a script?

00:04:20.301 --> 00:04:23.388
Why not? You saying you severed ties
has me intrigued.

00:04:28.935 --> 00:04:30.687
Thing is, there was no major incident.

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:35.525
It was just two girls bickering
until they decided to sever ties.

00:04:36.359 --> 00:04:37.860
That's all there is to it.

00:04:37.944 --> 00:04:39.946
But why did you sever ties?

00:04:51.499 --> 00:04:52.375
Who knows?

00:04:58.006 --> 00:04:59.173
How does it feel?

00:05:00.425 --> 00:05:03.011
She said that you had
such a huge influence on her.

00:05:03.094 --> 00:05:05.388
The Cheon Sang-yeon said such a thing.

00:05:05.888 --> 00:05:07.849
Do you like Cheon Sang-yeon?

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:11.894
Well,

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:14.522
I don't dislike her.

00:05:15.023 --> 00:05:17.400
Her company tends to make solid movies.

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:20.778
I wouldn't know.
I haven't seen any of them.

00:05:22.363 --> 00:05:23.573
Even Echoes of Summer?

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:28.328
Okay, I guess I've seen that one.

00:05:30.246 --> 00:05:32.248
Sounds like
you intentionally avoided them.

00:05:35.335 --> 00:05:37.712
Oh, I don't know.

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:41.841
Maybe I'm being petty
because she's too successful.

00:05:42.842 --> 00:05:44.886
I guess I can't entirely deny it.

00:05:46.554 --> 00:05:49.098
I don't think
Cheon Sang-yeon deserves the success.

00:05:52.101 --> 00:05:52.935
Why not?

00:05:55.521 --> 00:05:57.106
Do you remember my miniseries?

00:05:58.399 --> 00:05:59.609
Yeong-won and Me.

00:06:01.069 --> 00:06:04.864
The character Cha Yeong-won
was modeled after Cheon Sang-yeon.

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:07.909
I made her work in advertising,

00:06:07.992 --> 00:06:10.870
but the rest is exactly what happened
with Echoes of Summer

00:06:11.371 --> 00:06:12.413
Echoes of Summer?

00:06:13.247 --> 00:06:14.749
You wrote that?

00:06:16.209 --> 00:06:17.043
Yes.

00:06:17.126 --> 00:06:19.754
Without that movie,
Swallow Pictures wouldn't exist today.

00:06:19.837 --> 00:06:21.172
I developed that story.

00:06:23.466 --> 00:06:25.551
Thinking about it
pisses me off all over again.

00:06:27.178 --> 00:06:28.846
Shall we write a show about it?

00:06:29.722 --> 00:06:31.682
-Rat her out to the world?
-Yes!

00:06:32.683 --> 00:06:33.893
There's no major incident.

00:06:34.477 --> 00:06:37.897
Of course there is. You severed ties!
And she stole Echoes of Summer.

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:38.981
Maybe you're right.

00:06:48.032 --> 00:06:49.158
Actually…

00:06:51.202 --> 00:06:53.371
I have written a little something.

00:06:53.913 --> 00:06:55.415
About you and Ms. Cheon?

00:06:55.498 --> 00:06:57.125
No, that's not it.

00:06:57.625 --> 00:06:59.127
Do you remember last year

00:07:00.086 --> 00:07:04.173
I told you that I wanted to write about
an elementary school teacher?

00:07:16.394 --> 00:07:19.814
I'm warning you that it's a rough draft.

00:07:20.398 --> 00:07:22.692
Start to finish,
it's just noisy elementary kids.

00:07:23.192 --> 00:07:25.653
Just hand it over. Come on. Don't worry.

00:08:09.655 --> 00:08:12.992
1992, FOURTH GRADE
FIRST DAY OF SECOND SEMESTER

00:08:13.075 --> 00:08:18.456
ILYEONG ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

00:08:40.269 --> 00:08:43.564
CLASS SCHEDULE

00:08:49.654 --> 00:08:50.488
Quiet!

00:08:52.865 --> 00:08:54.283
RYU EUN-JUNG

00:08:58.788 --> 00:09:00.248
Come in.

00:09:00.748 --> 00:09:03.834
Twelve new kids transferred
in a single day.

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:07.880
Come in. Stand at the front.

00:09:11.968 --> 00:09:15.930
-Attention. Salute.
-Good morning, sir.

00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:17.932
Did you enjoy your break?

00:09:18.015 --> 00:09:19.850
Yes!

00:09:20.351 --> 00:09:22.979
You're not quite sure
what's going on, right?

00:09:23.062 --> 00:09:24.689
Yes!

00:09:25.314 --> 00:09:26.899
The kids who are absent today,

00:09:26.983 --> 00:09:29.402
Sang-uk, Yong-don, Sang-beom, Jeong-ho,

00:09:29.485 --> 00:09:32.530
Geun-su, Eun-i, Mi-jin,
Hyo-jin, and Shin-yeong,

00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:35.533
all transferred
to a different school over break.

00:09:37.785 --> 00:09:40.538
Did you see the new apartment complex
on your way to school?

00:09:40.621 --> 00:09:42.248
Yes!

00:09:42.331 --> 00:09:46.210
These kids have all moved
into those new apartments.

00:09:48.504 --> 00:09:52.049
I'm Shin An-na
from Anyang East Elementary.

00:09:52.133 --> 00:09:53.968
My name is Lee Ji-seon.

00:09:54.051 --> 00:09:55.094
I'm Kim Jeong-ho.

00:09:55.177 --> 00:09:56.178
I'm Seo Jeong-sik.

00:09:56.262 --> 00:09:57.680
My hobby is playing the piano.

00:09:57.763 --> 00:09:59.181
I'm good at arm wrestling.

00:09:59.265 --> 00:10:01.017
It's nice to meet you.

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:02.435
Nice to meet you.

00:10:06.272 --> 00:10:07.732
It's Sang-yeon's turn.

00:10:08.733 --> 00:10:10.568
Come here. Everyone, listen up.

00:10:14.363 --> 00:10:18.451
Hi, guys. I'm Cheon Sang-yeon,
transferring from Myeongjeong Elementary.

00:10:19.327 --> 00:10:23.164
My mom told me that the "yeon" in my name
means "swallow."

00:10:23.664 --> 00:10:25.207
Swallows are drifters,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.960
so my dream is to be a deadbeat drifter.

00:10:29.629 --> 00:10:31.505
She wants to be a deadbeat!

00:10:31.589 --> 00:10:36.510
Sang-yeon's grandfather is rather famous.
He was once a government minister.

00:10:36.594 --> 00:10:38.971
Whoa, cool!

00:10:39.055 --> 00:10:42.933
Sang-yeon transferred here
from the best private school in Seoul,

00:10:43.017 --> 00:10:46.103
and while there,
she was an outstanding student.

00:10:46.187 --> 00:10:50.524
So our class has gained a great classmate.

00:10:50.608 --> 00:10:52.068
Round of applause, everyone!

00:10:52.151 --> 00:10:54.779
Wow!

00:10:55.279 --> 00:10:57.156
I think Cheon Sang-yeon is a genius.

00:10:57.239 --> 00:10:58.991
Really? How come?

00:10:59.617 --> 00:11:02.953
In math, she had a contest
with our class president, Kim Kyeong-ho,

00:11:03.454 --> 00:11:04.288
and she won!

00:11:05.164 --> 00:11:07.166
-Guess what they worked on.
-What?

00:11:07.249 --> 00:11:10.419
-A sixth-grade math question.
-A sixth-grade math question?

00:11:10.503 --> 00:11:13.339
The teacher first gave them
a fourth-grade math problem…

00:11:13.422 --> 00:11:16.217
I was subdued and silent at school,

00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:19.387
but outside of school,
I became a total chatterbox.

00:11:19.929 --> 00:11:22.515
He ended up giving them
a fifth-grade question.

00:11:23.432 --> 00:11:25.851
-Thank you, sir.
-Bye, kids.

00:11:30.439 --> 00:11:34.360
Wasn't your class also short on desks
because of the new kids?

00:11:34.443 --> 00:11:36.529
We were three short. What about yours?

00:11:37.029 --> 00:11:39.990
-We were two desks short.
-What did your class do?

00:11:40.574 --> 00:11:43.911
Two of the new transfers don't have desks.

00:11:44.412 --> 00:11:47.164
It would be nice
if someone volunteered to give up theirs.

00:11:47.248 --> 00:11:51.168
The teacher asked the boys
if any of them would give up their seats,

00:11:51.669 --> 00:11:52.962
and Kyeong-ho offered first.

00:11:53.045 --> 00:11:56.549
-I will.
-I will!

00:11:56.632 --> 00:11:58.426
Then all the other boys offered,

00:11:58.509 --> 00:12:00.469
and the teacher decided…

00:12:02.346 --> 00:12:06.726
Alrighty, then. Let's see who'll be
so kind as to give up their seats.

00:12:06.809 --> 00:12:08.811
Let's see. Our volunteers will be

00:12:08.894 --> 00:12:11.021
Go Yeong-rok and Lee Jeong-kyu!

00:12:11.814 --> 00:12:14.066
What? Go Yeong-rok and Lee Jeong-kyu?

00:12:14.567 --> 00:12:16.736
Even though Kyeong-ho offered first?

00:12:16.819 --> 00:12:17.820
I already told you.

00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:22.283
My teacher never makes
kids like Kyeong-ho do grunt work.

00:12:22.783 --> 00:12:24.577
Just the kids from our neighborhood.

00:12:25.286 --> 00:12:27.371
What did they do without desks?

00:12:27.955 --> 00:12:31.250
To read large numbers,
we group the digits in sets of four.

00:12:31.333 --> 00:12:34.879
Six, seven, eight, nine,
and two, three, four, five… like this.

00:12:34.962 --> 00:12:38.007
Now label the first three digits
as thousands, hundreds, and tens.

00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:38.966
The whole day?

00:12:39.049 --> 00:12:42.136
The whole day. What about you guys?

00:12:42.803 --> 00:12:44.096
We were all seated.

00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:45.556
Yes, ma'am!

00:12:45.639 --> 00:12:46.515
Now, listen up.

00:12:46.599 --> 00:12:50.352
A mixture is when more than two matters
are blended together.

00:12:50.436 --> 00:12:52.563
There are solid and liquid mixtures…

00:12:53.105 --> 00:12:53.981
On the vaulting horse?

00:12:54.732 --> 00:12:57.777
Yeah. The teacher and the class monitor
brought it to the classroom.

00:12:58.527 --> 00:13:00.613
You're so lucky you have a nice teacher.

00:13:01.113 --> 00:13:03.324
My teacher always plays favorites.

00:13:07.328 --> 00:13:10.122
It's my mom. I'll catch you later. Mom!

00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:48.536
Mom. Kim Mi-jin transferred schools.

00:13:48.619 --> 00:13:50.579
Really? Where to?

00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:55.709
I'm not sure. The teacher listed everyone
who transferred, including Mi-jin.

00:13:56.544 --> 00:13:58.087
-But…
-Here, drink this.

00:13:58.170 --> 00:13:59.380
For me? Again?

00:13:59.463 --> 00:14:00.881
-I'm just so grateful.
-Thanks.

00:14:00.965 --> 00:14:03.717
-Can I have the keys?
-The keys…

00:14:03.801 --> 00:14:05.469
The keys… Here they are.

00:14:06.262 --> 00:14:07.721
Thank you!

00:14:10.266 --> 00:14:11.100
Mom.

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:14.895
Mi-jin didn't return my comic book
before transferring.

00:14:14.979 --> 00:14:15.813
And?

00:14:16.397 --> 00:14:19.275
And I'd borrowed it
from the truck bookstore man.

00:14:19.775 --> 00:14:20.609
And?

00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:23.863
I need to pay him for the comic book.
Can I have 1,700 won?

00:14:25.155 --> 00:14:27.950
Is that why you followed me here?

00:14:28.033 --> 00:14:28.868
Yes.

00:14:32.037 --> 00:14:35.124
Don't you have any homework
now that school has started?

00:14:35.624 --> 00:14:37.751
Twelve kids transferred to my class today.

00:14:37.835 --> 00:14:39.712
-Twelve kids?
-Yeah.

00:14:39.795 --> 00:14:42.798
There's this new kid
named Cheon Sang-yeon.

00:14:42.882 --> 00:14:46.010
Apparently, her grandad was a minister.
That means he's high up, right?

00:14:46.093 --> 00:14:48.596
High up, indeed.
What was he a minister of?

00:14:49.096 --> 00:14:51.640
I don't know. Just a famous minister.

00:14:53.684 --> 00:14:57.479
Mom, whose house is this? How come you're…

00:15:00.524 --> 00:15:02.610
-Do you like it?
-Yeah.

00:15:04.278 --> 00:15:05.738
The curtains are already up.

00:15:06.447 --> 00:15:07.406
How pretty.

00:15:12.995 --> 00:15:14.872
I have to work, so look around.

00:15:16.415 --> 00:15:18.167
-I can look around?
-Why not?

00:15:24.006 --> 00:15:28.010
That was the first time
I ever stepped inside an apartment.

00:15:30.721 --> 00:15:31.931
That apartment

00:15:33.265 --> 00:15:34.642
was spacious,

00:15:35.309 --> 00:15:36.393
spacious,

00:15:36.894 --> 00:15:38.187
and spacious.

00:15:38.729 --> 00:15:40.481
It was just so spacious.

00:16:24.566 --> 00:16:27.903
Mom! There's a bathroom
inside the bedroom!

00:16:27.987 --> 00:16:28.821
And?

00:16:29.655 --> 00:16:33.951
Not the one out there.
There's another bathroom in this room!

00:16:34.034 --> 00:16:37.621
I know. This place has two bathrooms.

00:16:39.748 --> 00:16:41.250
There are two bathrooms?

00:16:42.876 --> 00:16:45.713
How can a single house have two bathrooms?

00:16:45.796 --> 00:16:46.755
All these places do.

00:16:47.798 --> 00:16:48.799
They all do?

00:16:49.967 --> 00:16:51.010
Love at first sight.

00:16:51.885 --> 00:16:54.179
-It was totally love at first sight.
-Mom.

00:16:55.139 --> 00:16:57.641
-Who lives in places like these?
-Who knows?

00:16:58.684 --> 00:17:00.853
The security guard says
it's a family of four,

00:17:00.936 --> 00:17:03.814
so it's probably two children
and their parents.

00:17:05.274 --> 00:17:06.358
Two children…

00:17:07.901 --> 00:17:10.195
If you're bored,
why not help your mom out?

00:17:10.279 --> 00:17:12.156
I'll give you 1,700 won.

00:17:12.656 --> 00:17:13.532
Really?

00:18:01.455 --> 00:18:05.334
YOU'RE SO LUCKY

00:18:21.058 --> 00:18:23.727
On Saturday, there was a vote
for class president.

00:18:23.811 --> 00:18:25.229
BALLOT

00:18:25.312 --> 00:18:28.148
In a democracy,
who you vote for is a secret.

00:18:37.116 --> 00:18:39.409
CHEON SANG-YEON

00:18:39.493 --> 00:18:40.744
Cheon Sang-yeon.

00:18:41.912 --> 00:18:44.873
SECOND SEMESTER CLASS PRESIDENT ELECTION
CHEON SANG-YEON, JEONG NAM-HYEON

00:18:44.957 --> 00:18:46.250
Cheon Sang-yeon.

00:18:48.210 --> 00:18:49.628
Cheon Sang-yeon.

00:18:55.008 --> 00:18:57.010
-Jeong Nam-hyeon.
-Huh?

00:18:57.094 --> 00:18:59.346
Nam-hyeon, did you vote for yourself?

00:19:00.389 --> 00:19:01.765
I did not!

00:19:01.849 --> 00:19:04.476
-He totally voted for himself!
-He totally did!

00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:07.187
When the teacher isn't here,
you're in charge.

00:19:07.271 --> 00:19:09.398
Make sure the kids aren't chattering.

00:19:09.481 --> 00:19:12.276
And if they don't listen to you,
you can hit them with this.

00:19:12.359 --> 00:19:13.652
Kyeong-ho's right.

00:19:14.153 --> 00:19:16.613
Who's in charge when I'm not here?

00:19:16.697 --> 00:19:19.032
-The class president!
-Correct.

00:19:19.116 --> 00:19:20.284
A round of applause.

00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:39.636
I'll help you with this.

00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:42.472
-Sorry?
-Hello. I'm the Seoul Milk lady.

00:19:42.556 --> 00:19:43.640
That's quite all right.

00:19:43.724 --> 00:19:47.352
Milk and newspaper delivery folks
promote sales like this,

00:19:47.436 --> 00:19:48.937
so no pressure.

00:19:49.438 --> 00:19:50.856
I just feel bad.

00:19:50.939 --> 00:19:54.193
If you do, spare me
ten minutes of your time later.

00:19:54.276 --> 00:19:55.903
You'll see it yourself,

00:19:55.986 --> 00:19:58.488
but you don't need to clean
the sink and shelves.

00:19:58.572 --> 00:20:00.782
I wiped everything down
with a sterile cloth.

00:20:01.283 --> 00:20:02.743
When did you do all that?

00:20:03.410 --> 00:20:04.828
Please be careful.

00:20:04.912 --> 00:20:06.747
-Seventh floor, right?
-Yes.

00:20:07.372 --> 00:20:09.750
You always let him have his way!

00:20:11.835 --> 00:20:14.254
-Help me with this.
-Put everything inside.

00:20:15.088 --> 00:20:17.883
How pretty. Is she your daughter?

00:20:18.467 --> 00:20:21.678
Yes. She's upset
because she prefers her brother's room.

00:20:22.804 --> 00:20:25.015
-What grade is she in?
-Fourth.

00:20:25.515 --> 00:20:26.725
Ilyeong Elementary?

00:20:26.808 --> 00:20:29.228
Yes. She made the transfer last week.

00:20:29.728 --> 00:20:32.272
She wouldn't be in class five, would she?

00:20:32.773 --> 00:20:33.774
Why do you ask?

00:20:35.234 --> 00:20:37.152
The homeroom teacher is rather…

00:20:38.654 --> 00:20:40.280
Why? What are they like?

00:20:40.364 --> 00:20:43.200
I hear they treat children
based on their family's wealth.

00:20:43.283 --> 00:20:46.245
One day, they were short on desks
because of the new transfers,

00:20:46.328 --> 00:20:49.539
and the two poorest kids
were told to sit on the floor.

00:20:49.623 --> 00:20:51.959
-For the entire day, no less.
-Oh dear.

00:20:52.793 --> 00:20:56.588
How do you know such things?

00:20:56.672 --> 00:20:58.548
My kid told me.

00:20:58.632 --> 00:21:01.343
She must have thought it was unfair.

00:21:01.426 --> 00:21:03.845
Your child must be smart. What's her name?

00:21:04.471 --> 00:21:06.640
It's Eun-jung. Ryu Eun-jung.

00:21:13.730 --> 00:21:14.731
Stop it.

00:21:18.944 --> 00:21:19.778
Cut it out.

00:21:21.822 --> 00:21:22.823
Keep it down.

00:21:25.659 --> 00:21:27.744
-I told you to stop it.
-Hey, you.

00:21:29.454 --> 00:21:30.330
Come up here.

00:21:32.249 --> 00:21:36.628
It's just… Kim Hyeon-tae keeps kicking
my art project.

00:21:36.712 --> 00:21:37.671
Kim Hyeon-tae too.

00:21:37.754 --> 00:21:40.173
Me? But I didn't say anything.

00:21:49.558 --> 00:21:53.645
Honestly, I wasn't trying to talk.
Kim Hyeon-tae kept kicking my project--

00:21:53.729 --> 00:21:57.065
Ryu Eun-jung. If the class president
tells you to come up, you listen.

00:21:57.149 --> 00:21:59.151
Would you talk back to the teacher?

00:22:16.418 --> 00:22:17.336
Palms out.

00:22:20.088 --> 00:22:22.924
-You too.
-I told you I didn't say anything.

00:22:25.635 --> 00:22:27.179
She hits really hard.

00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:34.561
Hey, Ryu Eun-jung.

00:23:17.396 --> 00:23:19.439
Mommy's home.

00:23:21.691 --> 00:23:23.235
Did you kids have a good day?

00:23:32.119 --> 00:23:32.953
What's wrong?

00:23:33.036 --> 00:23:34.287
Is something up?

00:23:34.788 --> 00:23:35.664
No.

00:23:39.334 --> 00:23:40.168
Let me see you.

00:23:41.461 --> 00:23:43.797
So something is up!

00:23:45.549 --> 00:23:46.883
I told you. It's nothing.

00:23:47.384 --> 00:23:50.137
Who was it? Who upset my daughter?

00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:52.806
Mom, the thing is,

00:23:53.306 --> 00:23:55.559
earlier at school, Cheon Sang-yeon, she…

00:23:55.642 --> 00:23:58.311
I was so upset and humiliated
by that incident

00:23:58.895 --> 00:24:01.148
that I held a grudge for a very long time.

00:24:02.065 --> 00:24:04.943
Even after we moved up a grade
and were put in separate classes,

00:24:05.026 --> 00:24:07.946
just seeing Cheon Sang-yeon
triggered an urge to fight.

00:24:11.241 --> 00:24:14.494
As my grades improved,
and I made more friends in fifth grade,

00:24:14.578 --> 00:24:15.871
my personality changed.

00:24:15.954 --> 00:24:17.080
Catch it!

00:24:17.164 --> 00:24:19.666
Wait, time out! You stepped on the line.

00:24:19.749 --> 00:24:21.751
-I didn't.
-Basically, I became cocky.

00:24:23.962 --> 00:24:25.839
She stepped on the line right here.

00:24:27.799 --> 00:24:29.885
-Let's just play.
-I didn't step on the line.

00:24:29.968 --> 00:24:31.761
Hurry up.

00:24:33.763 --> 00:24:35.015
Come on, try harder.

00:24:35.098 --> 00:24:36.391
Throw it over here.

00:24:37.309 --> 00:24:38.268
-Nice one.
-Catch it!

00:24:41.396 --> 00:24:42.772
-Are you okay?
-Are you hurt?

00:24:42.856 --> 00:24:44.149
Are you all right?

00:24:44.649 --> 00:24:47.194
Ryu Eun-jung!
Why did you aim for her head?

00:24:47.277 --> 00:24:50.906
-She threw it at her on purpose.
-Why would I do that?

00:24:50.989 --> 00:24:53.867
You've only been attacking Sang-yeon.

00:24:53.950 --> 00:24:57.996
That's because Cheon Sang-yeon's good.
You were all attacking Eun-jung.

00:24:58.497 --> 00:25:01.500
-It's dodgeball. People get hit.
-But she threw it at her head!

00:25:01.583 --> 00:25:04.252
It really hurts to get hit in the head.

00:25:04.336 --> 00:25:05.337
You can die!

00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:07.506
-No, you can't.
-Yes, you can!

00:25:08.298 --> 00:25:09.174
The teacher's here.

00:25:10.008 --> 00:25:11.218
Everyone freeze.

00:25:11.801 --> 00:25:15.222
Why are you fighting
instead of playing dodgeball?

00:25:34.157 --> 00:25:35.158
You're here.

00:25:43.166 --> 00:25:44.417
Hello.

00:25:44.918 --> 00:25:46.294
Hi, Eun-jung.

00:25:48.046 --> 00:25:51.925
It happened while playing dodgeball,
so Eun-jung should apologize.

00:25:52.759 --> 00:25:55.053
Why don't you two shake hands and make up?

00:25:58.557 --> 00:25:59.391
I'm sorry.

00:26:06.022 --> 00:26:08.775
Class matches often get
a little out of hand.

00:26:09.359 --> 00:26:12.237
Sang-yeon,
stop being dramatic and make up.

00:26:17.367 --> 00:26:19.035
Admit that you did it on purpose.

00:26:20.036 --> 00:26:22.080
-I didn't.
-As if!

00:26:22.622 --> 00:26:24.457
You attacked me from the start.

00:26:26.084 --> 00:26:27.794
It still wasn't on purpose.

00:26:29.879 --> 00:26:32.299
You mean it wasn't intentional, right?

00:26:35.844 --> 00:26:38.680
I didn't mean to throw it at her head.

00:26:38.763 --> 00:26:39.598
Of course you did!

00:26:40.557 --> 00:26:41.641
Cheon Sang-yeon.

00:26:42.934 --> 00:26:44.853
You don't even know what happened.

00:26:45.395 --> 00:26:46.855
She did it on purpose!

00:26:48.690 --> 00:26:49.983
Cheon Sang-yeon.

00:26:59.701 --> 00:27:00.619
Mom?

00:27:01.119 --> 00:27:01.995
Yes?

00:27:02.078 --> 00:27:02.912
Today,

00:27:04.414 --> 00:27:08.126
we played dodgeball in gym class,
and I threw the ball at Sang-yeon.

00:27:08.627 --> 00:27:10.754
It hit her head, so she went to the nurse.

00:27:10.837 --> 00:27:13.423
To the nurse? How hard did you hit her?

00:27:13.506 --> 00:27:15.925
I didn't hit her.
The ball did. It was dodgeball.

00:27:22.223 --> 00:27:23.058
But

00:27:23.850 --> 00:27:25.185
it did hit her hard.

00:27:25.268 --> 00:27:27.812
Well, is she okay?

00:27:28.396 --> 00:27:34.277
Yeah. She was all right soon after,
but I can't tell if I did it on purpose.

00:27:36.196 --> 00:27:39.658
Even though I wasn't sure,
I denied it to the teacher.

00:27:40.492 --> 00:27:41.660
Does that count as lying?

00:27:42.535 --> 00:27:44.037
Who knows?

00:27:46.915 --> 00:27:49.125
Are you really not sure?

00:27:58.635 --> 00:28:02.722
Mom, Ms. Yoon came
to the nurse's office earlier.

00:28:03.390 --> 00:28:04.808
My writing teacher.

00:28:05.392 --> 00:28:07.310
-Really?
-Yeah.

00:28:07.394 --> 00:28:09.896
I wonder why she was there at all.

00:28:09.979 --> 00:28:11.523
What did she say?

00:28:12.107 --> 00:28:17.696
She told Sang-yeon to make up with me,
but Sang-yeon talked back to her and left.

00:28:17.779 --> 00:28:20.490
-She said, "You don't know what happened."
-Really?

00:28:20.990 --> 00:28:22.659
She spoke rudely to the teacher?

00:28:22.742 --> 00:28:23.952
Exactly.

00:28:29.207 --> 00:28:31.042
-Move your legs.
-Don't touch me.

00:28:33.044 --> 00:28:36.047
I don't know. I really don't.

00:28:36.673 --> 00:28:40.176
-Write about it in your journal.
-I wouldn't know what to write.

00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:42.595
Write that you don't know!

00:28:44.097 --> 00:28:46.641
Tomorrow's Wednesday!
You have your extracurricular class.

00:28:52.230 --> 00:28:56.192
THEME: THE MOST IMPORTANT PROMISE
I EVER MADE

00:29:01.865 --> 00:29:06.327
For my extracurricular class,
I was in Ms. Yoon's writing class.

00:29:08.788 --> 00:29:11.374
Now that I think about it,
my personality changed

00:29:12.125 --> 00:29:13.418
on that day.

00:29:18.465 --> 00:29:20.341
Raise your hand if you don't have a mom.

00:29:20.425 --> 00:29:21.468
1 YEAR AGO

00:29:21.551 --> 00:29:23.303
I'd wanted to cry that day

00:29:23.970 --> 00:29:26.890
because that morning,
there had been a family background check.

00:29:26.973 --> 00:29:28.224
No one.

00:29:28.725 --> 00:29:30.602
Raise your hand if you don't have a dad.

00:29:32.771 --> 00:29:34.731
-You don't live with your dad?
-I don't.

00:29:35.356 --> 00:29:37.567
-Your name?
-Lee Han-jun.

00:29:37.650 --> 00:29:39.694
Hey. You don't have a dad either.

00:29:40.487 --> 00:29:42.530
He's only asking the new kids.

00:29:45.116 --> 00:29:46.951
Anyone else without a dad?

00:29:47.035 --> 00:29:48.661
Ryu Eun-jung doesn't have one!

00:29:49.829 --> 00:29:51.331
She's always been at this school.

00:29:51.414 --> 00:29:53.792
I'm just asking about the new transfers.

00:29:59.130 --> 00:30:02.675
Let's move on to your parents' education
if there's no one else.

00:30:03.593 --> 00:30:05.553
Whose parents only finished
elementary school?

00:30:06.763 --> 00:30:09.265
-Goodbye.
-See you next class.

00:30:09.849 --> 00:30:10.683
Goodbye.

00:30:15.855 --> 00:30:16.898
Eun-jung?

00:30:18.358 --> 00:30:19.651
Hello.

00:30:21.277 --> 00:30:24.948
This is quite heavy.
Would you mind helping me?

00:30:26.157 --> 00:30:26.991
Sure.

00:30:30.620 --> 00:30:31.538
Thank you.

00:30:35.416 --> 00:30:39.128
I was shocked that she knew my name.

00:30:40.004 --> 00:30:42.423
Other teachers didn't know my name

00:30:42.924 --> 00:30:45.176
because I was one of those kids
who blended in.

00:30:45.677 --> 00:30:47.595
I was invisible.

00:30:58.189 --> 00:30:59.357
All done!

00:30:59.858 --> 00:31:01.818
You've been so helpful. Why don't you sit?

00:31:01.901 --> 00:31:02.735
Okay.

00:31:14.330 --> 00:31:15.707
Thank you for helping me.

00:31:21.004 --> 00:31:22.630
Why don't you take off your bag?

00:31:24.424 --> 00:31:25.258
Drink up.

00:31:46.154 --> 00:31:47.530
Eun-jung.

00:31:49.782 --> 00:31:51.367
You don't have a dad, do you?

00:31:55.455 --> 00:31:56.289
No, I don't.

00:31:58.041 --> 00:32:00.335
Are you shocked that I knew?

00:32:02.253 --> 00:32:05.256
I was passing in the hallway
and happened to overhear.

00:32:10.887 --> 00:32:14.682
My dad also passed away when I was young.

00:32:18.186 --> 00:32:20.521
He passed away when I was in sixth grade.

00:32:21.022 --> 00:32:23.191
How old were you when yours passed?

00:32:25.485 --> 00:32:26.694
I was eight.

00:32:29.614 --> 00:32:30.782
I see.

00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:33.910
You must have been so heartbroken.

00:32:36.245 --> 00:32:38.039
It was like that for me too.

00:32:39.415 --> 00:32:43.127
I felt so sad whenever I missed my dad.

00:32:45.421 --> 00:32:46.631
Do you feel the same?

00:32:49.342 --> 00:32:50.176
Yes.

00:33:10.613 --> 00:33:11.781
Thank you.

00:33:13.533 --> 00:33:15.118
Go on and blow your nose.

00:33:29.424 --> 00:33:30.258
Eun-jung.

00:33:31.050 --> 00:33:35.638
I really wanted to tell you this.

00:33:37.765 --> 00:33:41.269
Whether it's not having a dad or a mom,

00:33:42.228 --> 00:33:46.399
it's sad not being able
to see the ones you love.

00:33:48.818 --> 00:33:50.611
Yet, for some reason,

00:33:51.112 --> 00:33:54.907
when I was younger,
I felt ashamed about not having a dad.

00:33:57.410 --> 00:34:01.247
I didn't feel that way when I was alone,
but in front of others,

00:34:02.248 --> 00:34:03.708
I think I felt embarrassed.

00:34:07.503 --> 00:34:11.090
But now I think of it this way.

00:34:16.429 --> 00:34:17.513
Look here.

00:34:25.313 --> 00:34:29.942
This is the space
you hold in your heart for your dad.

00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:34.989
Your dad's not with you now,
so it's empty, and that makes you sad.

00:34:36.657 --> 00:34:37.575
Yes.

00:34:37.658 --> 00:34:43.372
But it's up to you to decide
what to fill this space with.

00:34:44.165 --> 00:34:45.708
If you, Eun-jung,

00:34:46.334 --> 00:34:47.627
decide to fill this space

00:34:49.128 --> 00:34:50.338
like this,

00:34:50.838 --> 00:34:53.966
you could fill it up with goodness.

00:34:55.051 --> 00:34:56.260
There. It's full.

00:34:58.262 --> 00:35:00.556
Once you grow up, you can say,

00:35:01.057 --> 00:35:03.101
"Not having a dad made me sad,

00:35:03.601 --> 00:35:06.979
but I filled his space with these things,

00:35:07.063 --> 00:35:12.026
which made me the person I am today."

00:35:13.611 --> 00:35:18.908
Don't you think that would make your dad
proud as he looks down on you?

00:35:19.450 --> 00:35:20.284
Yes.

00:35:24.580 --> 00:35:27.416
On days when you're sad, write a journal.

00:35:27.917 --> 00:35:31.254
Not the sort of journal
you write for homework,

00:35:31.337 --> 00:35:34.298
but about how you really feel.

00:35:35.633 --> 00:35:36.467
Okay.

00:35:53.860 --> 00:35:57.780
Hand in your work if you're finished.
If not, finish it by tomorrow.

00:35:58.281 --> 00:36:01.409
And don't forget to collect your journal
if you handed it in.

00:36:01.492 --> 00:36:03.077
-Yes, ma'am.
-Park Yeon-jin?

00:36:06.414 --> 00:36:07.248
Eun-jung?

00:36:08.624 --> 00:36:09.458
Here.

00:36:11.085 --> 00:36:14.046
-Next, Sang-hyeok.
-Thank you.

00:36:19.010 --> 00:36:20.094
Bye.

00:36:22.138 --> 00:36:23.890
TITLE: MY CONFUSED FEELINGS

00:36:24.473 --> 00:36:28.144
You're right.
Our own feelings can be confusing.

00:36:28.227 --> 00:36:32.315
Nevertheless, it's important to try
to understand your own feelings.

00:36:32.398 --> 00:36:34.150
It's a rather exciting journey too.

00:36:35.234 --> 00:36:38.029
One 500ml carton for apartment 1203.

00:36:38.112 --> 00:36:39.864
One 500ml carton for 904.

00:36:39.947 --> 00:36:42.408
One strawberry, one plain for 804.

00:36:42.491 --> 00:36:44.327
A one-liter carton for 403.

00:36:44.994 --> 00:36:47.872
-For 804--
-I know. It goes in the pouch.

00:36:50.082 --> 00:36:51.876
-See you later.
-Okay.

00:37:32.458 --> 00:37:33.417
SEOUL MILK

00:37:39.590 --> 00:37:41.634
-Watch it.
-I'm sorry, sir.

00:37:41.717 --> 00:37:43.302
-I'm sorry.
-You should be careful.

00:37:43.386 --> 00:37:45.221
-What is it, Dad?
-Are you okay?

00:37:45.304 --> 00:37:46.973
-Yes.
-You…

00:37:54.230 --> 00:37:55.606
The kid's not to blame.

00:37:56.315 --> 00:37:58.234
If you don't study,
that'll be your future.

00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:05.283
It just had to be a day
when I had math class.

00:38:06.450 --> 00:38:09.745
Math classes were split
according to your grades.

00:38:09.829 --> 00:38:12.581
I was in the A class, so naturally,

00:38:12.665 --> 00:38:14.375
Cheon Sang-yeon was too.

00:38:20.339 --> 00:38:22.717
So what is a parallelogram?

00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:28.014
It's a quadrilateral in which
both pairs of opposite sides are parallel.

00:38:28.514 --> 00:38:31.559
If we call these parallel sides
the base sides of the parallelogram,

00:38:31.642 --> 00:38:33.436
we can calculate the distance between…

00:38:35.688 --> 00:38:38.316
Ryu Eun-jung,
I heard that you deliver milk.

00:38:40.192 --> 00:38:41.027
What?

00:38:41.110 --> 00:38:42.445
Who delivers what?

00:38:42.945 --> 00:38:44.947
Ryu Eun-jung. She delivers milk.

00:38:46.073 --> 00:38:48.159
-Is that true?
-No.

00:38:49.201 --> 00:38:50.953
I don't. I was just helping my mom.

00:38:51.037 --> 00:38:52.455
Yeah, by delivering milk.

00:38:54.457 --> 00:38:57.001
Didn't you hear her say
she was helping her mom?

00:39:00.087 --> 00:39:01.380
Kim Seong-kwon.

00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:05.217
-He's in class one, isn't he?
-Yeah.

00:39:06.010 --> 00:39:06.844
Why?

00:39:07.386 --> 00:39:09.847
It was clear
that Cheon Sang-yeon had told him.

00:39:10.931 --> 00:39:13.100
Cheon Sang-yeon was also in class one.

00:39:13.184 --> 00:39:15.478
Why are you telling kids
that I deliver milk?

00:39:15.978 --> 00:39:18.022
-I did?
-Yeah!

00:39:18.522 --> 00:39:20.441
I helped my mom, who had hurt her leg.

00:39:21.025 --> 00:39:22.651
Why would you start such a rumor?

00:39:23.861 --> 00:39:25.321
I didn't start any rumors.

00:39:25.404 --> 00:39:28.074
Then why is Seong-kwon from your class
teasing me about it?

00:39:28.157 --> 00:39:30.534
How would I know? I didn't tell him.

00:39:36.624 --> 00:39:37.625
I should ask you.

00:39:38.584 --> 00:39:40.336
Why do you have it out for me?

00:39:41.504 --> 00:39:43.422
-I do not.
-Admit it!

00:39:43.506 --> 00:39:47.301
You attack only me in dodgeball.
You even hit me with the ball.

00:39:47.385 --> 00:39:48.469
I didn't hit you.

00:39:48.552 --> 00:39:50.304
It sure hurt.

00:39:51.097 --> 00:39:54.058
-If it hurt, it means you hit me.
-You hit me first!

00:39:54.558 --> 00:39:55.393
I did?

00:39:58.229 --> 00:39:59.563
-When?
-In fourth grade!

00:39:59.647 --> 00:40:02.483
You called me to the front
and hit me with the teacher's rod.

00:40:05.945 --> 00:40:07.196
That was you?

00:40:07.279 --> 00:40:09.156
Yeah, that was me, okay?

00:40:09.740 --> 00:40:12.618
I wasn't chattering that day.
Kim Hyeon-tae kept goofing off.

00:40:13.119 --> 00:40:16.622
Plus, my mom says it's ridiculous
for a student to hit another student.

00:40:20.709 --> 00:40:21.544
Okay.

00:40:22.628 --> 00:40:25.965
I get it.
If you're so upset, you can hit me too.

00:40:27.633 --> 00:40:28.467
What?

00:40:28.551 --> 00:40:31.011
I said hit me. Then we'd be even.

00:40:32.388 --> 00:40:33.222
Hit me with this.

00:40:35.933 --> 00:40:36.767
Hit me.

00:40:36.851 --> 00:40:38.394
Do you think I won't?

00:40:38.477 --> 00:40:39.937
I'm telling you to go ahead.

00:40:40.020 --> 00:40:41.772
-You're seriously--
-Go on, hit me!

00:40:49.113 --> 00:40:50.906
Hey, are you crying?

00:40:50.990 --> 00:40:52.491
As if I'd cry!

00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:56.162
-Why won't you hit me?
-Do you know how much this would hurt?

00:40:58.330 --> 00:41:00.166
This is harder than wood.

00:41:12.636 --> 00:41:15.931
You're the one who couldn't hit me,
so don't blame me.

00:41:19.810 --> 00:41:21.187
You really didn't tell anyone?

00:41:21.770 --> 00:41:22.855
I didn't.

00:41:23.355 --> 00:41:24.690
Swear on it.

00:41:24.773 --> 00:41:25.608
I swear.

00:41:32.907 --> 00:41:33.949
Hey, Ryu Eun-jung!

00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:39.622
You may not have hit me,

00:41:40.122 --> 00:41:42.082
but I was already punished
for hitting you.

00:41:44.835 --> 00:41:46.170
I didn't know it was you,

00:41:47.379 --> 00:41:49.924
but my mom hit me
for hitting you that day.

00:41:53.594 --> 00:41:55.012
My mom's Yoon Hyun-sook.

00:41:58.098 --> 00:41:59.183
Ms. Yoon?

00:41:59.808 --> 00:42:00.643
Yeah.

00:42:23.415 --> 00:42:24.959
Mom, guess what.

00:42:25.042 --> 00:42:27.503
Cheon Sang-yeon is Ms. Yoon's daughter.

00:42:27.586 --> 00:42:28.629
Really?

00:42:28.712 --> 00:42:31.715
Yeah. Last year, Ms. Yoon
was the homeroom teacher for--

00:42:31.799 --> 00:42:34.677
I know. The homeroom teacher
for the class next to yours.

00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:36.720
This year,
she teaches extracurricular classes.

00:42:36.804 --> 00:42:39.139
Yeah. It turns out that
she's Cheon Sang-yeon's mom.

00:42:39.223 --> 00:42:41.308
Really?

00:42:45.437 --> 00:42:47.815
Hold up. Did you already know?

00:42:48.524 --> 00:42:50.150
Yeah, I already knew.

00:42:50.234 --> 00:42:51.610
How did you know?

00:42:52.194 --> 00:42:53.737
She buys her milk from me.

00:42:56.031 --> 00:42:57.408
It's hot. Move your hands.

00:43:05.249 --> 00:43:06.375
-Mom.
-Yeah?

00:43:06.458 --> 00:43:09.420
Was it you who told her I got hit?

00:43:09.503 --> 00:43:10.337
Yeah.

00:43:10.838 --> 00:43:12.590
I went to collect their milk money

00:43:12.673 --> 00:43:14.800
and told her your class president hit you.

00:43:14.883 --> 00:43:17.344
She was utterly shocked and apologized,

00:43:17.428 --> 00:43:19.430
saying her daughter
is your class president.

00:43:20.097 --> 00:43:21.390
Why didn't you tell me?

00:43:22.391 --> 00:43:23.809
She told me not to.

00:43:24.977 --> 00:43:26.854
She teaches the class next to yours

00:43:26.937 --> 00:43:29.481
and no one at school
knows she's her daughter.

00:43:30.232 --> 00:43:31.817
Don't tell the kids.

00:43:32.526 --> 00:43:33.360
Okay.

00:43:35.404 --> 00:43:39.408
Apparently,
Ms. Yoon hit Sang-yeon for hitting me.

00:43:40.242 --> 00:43:41.744
-She did?
-Yes.

00:43:43.787 --> 00:43:48.042
Cheon Sang-yeon's transferring next month.
Can't you be friends until then?

00:43:48.125 --> 00:43:50.961
You want me to be friends
with Cheon Sang-yeon?

00:43:51.045 --> 00:43:52.046
Yeah.

00:43:53.922 --> 00:43:55.049
How tasty.

00:43:55.132 --> 00:43:59.219
The thought of being friends
with Sang-yeon was so absurd

00:44:00.220 --> 00:44:02.723
because Cheon Sang-yeon
was just too smart.

00:44:03.974 --> 00:44:06.185
It was absurd
because she had such fair skin,

00:44:06.268 --> 00:44:08.103
her grandad was a government minister,

00:44:08.896 --> 00:44:14.485
and her mom, Ms. Yoon,
was my favorite teacher.

00:44:15.736 --> 00:44:19.031
It was also because of Son Jun-ho,
my desk buddy.

00:44:20.532 --> 00:44:21.700
Hey, Ryu Eun-jung.

00:44:23.243 --> 00:44:24.244
Here.

00:44:26.955 --> 00:44:30.334
Son Jun-ho was very popular.

00:44:31.835 --> 00:44:34.797
Just this once. Please tell me.

00:44:36.674 --> 00:44:38.300
Who does Son Jun-ho like?

00:44:39.259 --> 00:44:42.680
I'm not sure, but I don't think it's you.

00:44:49.645 --> 00:44:51.397
Still, deliver this to him.

00:45:01.740 --> 00:45:04.410
-Go Na-mi told me to give you this.
-Go Na-mi?

00:45:18.590 --> 00:45:21.593
If I'm honest, I liked Son Jun-ho too.

00:45:25.180 --> 00:45:27.433
Do you guys want to choose desk buddies?

00:45:28.183 --> 00:45:30.310
You'll soon be saying goodbye,
which is a shame.

00:45:32.646 --> 00:45:33.897
Don't you guys want to?

00:45:34.523 --> 00:45:36.400
Everyone in my class was keen.

00:45:36.483 --> 00:45:38.902
We are too.
Let us choose our buddies, please!

00:45:38.986 --> 00:45:40.738
-Yes, please.
-Please let us choose.

00:45:40.821 --> 00:45:41.655
Okay.

00:45:42.781 --> 00:45:45.367
-The process was simple.
-Jeong-sik?

00:45:46.285 --> 00:45:47.327
Lee Eun-jae.

00:45:47.411 --> 00:45:50.873
Boys would call out the name of the girl
they wanted to sit with,

00:45:50.956 --> 00:45:54.126
and the girl would get the final say.

00:45:54.209 --> 00:45:55.461
Seo Jeong-sik.

00:45:59.798 --> 00:46:00.799
Jun-ho?

00:46:00.883 --> 00:46:04.178
When it was Jun-ho's turn,
I was nervous for no reason.

00:46:04.803 --> 00:46:07.473
It was obvious who he would pick.

00:46:08.056 --> 00:46:10.851
Son Jun-ho would pick Cheon Sang-yeon.

00:46:11.560 --> 00:46:12.394
Ryu Eun-jung.

00:46:13.312 --> 00:46:15.063
Eun-jung?

00:46:22.571 --> 00:46:25.282
-See you all in our next class.
-Thank you!

00:46:25.365 --> 00:46:28.577
I could feel
the kids looking at me differently.

00:46:29.578 --> 00:46:31.079
All of them except one.

00:46:31.914 --> 00:46:33.957
-How could this happen?
-It's not a big deal.

00:46:36.668 --> 00:46:41.215
Then Cheon Sang-yeon transferred
to the new school across from ours.

00:46:54.269 --> 00:46:55.354
Can we talk?

00:47:06.698 --> 00:47:08.367
What? A love letter?

00:47:08.450 --> 00:47:13.539
Yeah. The day before she transferred,
Jun-ho wrote Sang-yeon a love letter.

00:47:15.249 --> 00:47:17.626
I heard that he cried
while giving it to her.

00:47:18.460 --> 00:47:19.294
He cried?

00:47:19.837 --> 00:47:22.506
Because it's so tragic
to part with the one he loves.

00:47:23.298 --> 00:47:25.467
-Right…
-Right?

00:47:26.009 --> 00:47:26.969
Come on.

00:47:27.052 --> 00:47:29.429
Now isn't the time
to be sitting here like this.

00:47:30.138 --> 00:47:31.265
What else should I do?

00:47:36.854 --> 00:47:38.230
Hey, Son Jun-ho!

00:47:39.606 --> 00:47:40.941
Tell us the truth.

00:47:41.024 --> 00:47:43.527
Did you really write Sang-yeon
a love letter?

00:47:44.027 --> 00:47:45.279
-Sang-yeon?
-A love letter?

00:47:45.362 --> 00:47:47.489
-The one who transferred?
-Really?

00:47:47.573 --> 00:47:49.825
-What are you talking about?
-Is it true?

00:47:51.451 --> 00:47:52.828
Do I have to answer?

00:47:52.911 --> 00:47:55.622
Unbelievable.
Of course you have to answer!

00:47:55.706 --> 00:47:59.626
If you wrote Sang-yeon a love letter,
it means that you like her.

00:48:00.127 --> 00:48:02.421
Then why pick Ryu Eun-jung
as your desk buddy?

00:48:02.504 --> 00:48:04.506
Because I wanted her as a desk buddy.

00:48:05.007 --> 00:48:08.677
Why would you pick her as your buddy
when you like another girl?

00:48:09.595 --> 00:48:12.014
-Eun-jung really likes you.
-I never said that.

00:48:12.723 --> 00:48:14.808
But you wrote Sang-yeon a love letter!

00:48:15.309 --> 00:48:18.020
You acting like that is confusing girls.

00:48:18.520 --> 00:48:20.105
That means you're two-timing!

00:48:21.523 --> 00:48:24.234
-Two-timing?
-Why are you yelling in our classroom?

00:48:24.318 --> 00:48:25.527
You stay out of it!

00:48:25.611 --> 00:48:29.072
Why should I? He says he wanted
to sit with her. What's the big deal?

00:48:29.615 --> 00:48:30.908
Incredible.

00:48:30.991 --> 00:48:34.703
-Why did you want to sit with Eun-jung?
-Because she's easy to be around.

00:48:34.786 --> 00:48:37.706
She was already my desk buddy,
so I was comfortable with her.

00:48:37.789 --> 00:48:40.208
That means you didn't pick her
because you liked her!

00:48:40.292 --> 00:48:43.712
So you picked her
because she was an easy choice?

00:48:43.795 --> 00:48:47.299
So what if she was an easy choice?
Why are you overreacting?

00:48:47.382 --> 00:48:49.676
What did you say? Overreacting?

00:48:50.177 --> 00:48:53.347
How dare you!
You think Eun-jung's a pushover?

00:49:04.066 --> 00:49:05.817
-Hello, ma'am.
-Hi, girls.

00:49:06.443 --> 00:49:08.111
-Hello.
-Hi.

00:49:08.195 --> 00:49:09.571
Wait, Eun-jung?

00:49:54.533 --> 00:49:57.202
Under the TV. Second drawer…

00:50:17.764 --> 00:50:20.434
It felt strange.

00:50:23.061 --> 00:50:24.563
It was all quite strange.

00:50:26.481 --> 00:50:30.068
It's not like I hadn't known that
Sang-yeon was Ms. Yoon's daughter,

00:50:31.445 --> 00:50:32.946
but I felt deflated,

00:50:33.822 --> 00:50:35.365
as though I'd just found out.

00:50:39.995 --> 00:50:40.954
Complete.

00:50:42.748 --> 00:50:45.042
Being there, Sang-yeon appeared

00:50:45.834 --> 00:50:47.294
complete.

00:50:48.670 --> 00:50:50.255
Entirely out of reach,

00:50:50.756 --> 00:50:53.341
like somebody I could never beat.

00:50:57.012 --> 00:50:58.597
It was that house.

00:51:00.307 --> 00:51:01.141
There.

00:51:02.517 --> 00:51:04.478
Cheon Sang-yeon was the one
who lived there.

00:51:40.764 --> 00:51:46.937
YOU'RE SO LUCKY

00:51:47.020 --> 00:51:48.063
Who are you?

00:51:53.568 --> 00:51:55.779
Who… are you?

00:51:59.658 --> 00:52:03.161
I'm, well… Ryu Eun-jung.

00:52:04.287 --> 00:52:06.248
This short middle school kid would,

00:52:06.790 --> 00:52:07.958
three years later,

00:52:09.042 --> 00:52:10.710
become my first love.

00:52:13.964 --> 00:52:15.132
Let's do this, Ms. Ryu.

00:52:18.343 --> 00:52:20.971
How can you say that
after reading a mere draft?

00:52:21.054 --> 00:52:22.681
Yes, it's a draft,

00:52:23.807 --> 00:52:25.308
but I think it'll be good.

00:52:26.017 --> 00:52:26.893
You do?

00:52:29.229 --> 00:52:32.399
It does feel nice to hear that from you.

00:52:32.899 --> 00:52:35.944
Why did you stop writing here?

00:52:36.444 --> 00:52:38.905
Things were getting juicy.
It should write itself.

00:52:43.910 --> 00:52:46.121
I guess something stopped me.

00:52:48.707 --> 00:52:50.750
I must have forgotten

00:52:51.918 --> 00:52:56.506
that writing about those times
would mean talking about Sang-hak oppa.

00:52:58.091 --> 00:53:00.302
Why? You can't talk about him?

00:53:02.345 --> 00:53:03.805
It's not that I can't.

00:53:04.389 --> 00:53:08.560
This person named Sang-hak.
He's Ms. Cheon's brother, right?

00:53:13.315 --> 00:53:15.817
Is it uncomfortable for you
to write about him?

00:53:16.818 --> 00:53:19.988
Why? How intense
was this first love of yours?

00:53:21.823 --> 00:53:24.868
If it was three years later,
you'd only have been in eighth grade.

00:53:26.536 --> 00:53:27.954
I guess so.

00:53:28.997 --> 00:53:30.540
Either way,

00:53:31.291 --> 00:53:34.294
he had a huge influence on me.

00:53:36.004 --> 00:53:37.505
Just write it.

00:53:50.060 --> 00:53:52.020
I don't know this number. Who could it be?

00:53:52.729 --> 00:53:53.939
Don't mind me.

00:53:56.816 --> 00:53:57.901
Hello?

00:54:00.820 --> 00:54:02.614
Yes, this is she. Who's calling?

00:54:07.869 --> 00:54:08.870
Sang-yeon?

00:54:12.082 --> 00:54:12.958
Cheon?

00:54:19.506 --> 00:54:21.383
Right. One second.

00:54:28.682 --> 00:54:30.809
Was it really Ms. Cheon?

00:54:35.939 --> 00:54:36.898
I guess so.

00:54:37.732 --> 00:54:38.775
What did she say?

00:54:40.777 --> 00:54:43.363
She wants to meet.
She needs to tell me something.

00:54:43.989 --> 00:54:44.864
Tell you what?

00:54:47.450 --> 00:54:50.161
Maybe she wants to offer you a project.

00:54:50.662 --> 00:54:53.873
Everyone from film production
is moving over to series these days.

00:55:19.482 --> 00:55:20.567
It's been a while.

00:55:22.068 --> 00:55:23.111
Why did you call?

00:55:32.996 --> 00:55:34.247
It's just

00:55:34.831 --> 00:55:36.708
you seemed so frigid.

00:55:39.961 --> 00:55:42.756
I remember when I'd use my mom
as an excuse.

00:55:44.841 --> 00:55:47.927
Back in the day,
whenever you were mad at me,

00:55:48.011 --> 00:55:49.512
I'd bring up my mom,

00:55:50.013 --> 00:55:52.599
and it would soften you up
and make you agree to anything.

00:55:58.772 --> 00:55:59.898
I've been practicing

00:56:01.483 --> 00:56:03.276
what I wanted to say to you today,

00:56:04.861 --> 00:56:07.238
but now that I'm here,
I can't get the words out.

00:56:07.322 --> 00:56:08.948
Just say it.

00:56:09.657 --> 00:56:11.618
Apparently, I'm dying.

00:56:18.917 --> 00:56:19.751
What?

00:56:24.589 --> 00:56:27.967
I'm only 43 years old.

00:56:37.977 --> 00:56:38.895
Are you

00:56:40.313 --> 00:56:41.147
ill?

00:56:41.731 --> 00:56:42.565
Cancer.

00:56:43.942 --> 00:56:44.901
It's terminal.

00:56:51.783 --> 00:56:54.494
It's unbelievable, isn't it?
I feel the same way.

00:56:59.874 --> 00:57:01.167
Hang on a minute.

00:57:06.548 --> 00:57:09.175
I have a favor to ask you.

00:57:15.473 --> 00:57:16.349
What is this?

00:57:27.694 --> 00:57:28.945
Keep looking.

00:57:40.415 --> 00:57:41.291
That's right.

00:57:42.292 --> 00:57:44.085
They've made films about it,

00:57:45.003 --> 00:57:46.296
so you might know

00:57:47.714 --> 00:57:50.550
about assisted dying.

00:57:58.057 --> 00:57:59.893
I know it's not an easy ask…

00:58:02.395 --> 00:58:04.772
but I really hope you'll help me.

00:58:11.613 --> 00:58:12.614
Won't you

00:58:13.823 --> 00:58:15.700
come with me?

01:01:52.083 --> 01:01:57.088
