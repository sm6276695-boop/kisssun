(Madam)

00:00:40.072 --> 00:00:41.474
Yes, hello?

00:00:42.174 --> 00:00:45.611
Was today the day to wrap things up?

00:00:46.312 --> 00:00:48.781
Yes. Everything is being prepared
without a hitch.

00:00:49.248 --> 00:00:50.716
Are you sure about this?

giving me a headache right now.

Is Ah Hyun doing okay?

00:01:01.327 --> 00:01:04.263
I heard the first months
of pregnancy are really tough.

00:01:04.263 --> 00:01:07.066
I'm wondering
if I should go visit her myself.

00:01:07.066 --> 00:01:10.202
She's holding up well.

00:01:10.202 --> 00:01:13.639
Once she's in the stable period,
I'll invite you to our home soon, Madam.

00:01:13.639 --> 00:01:16.442
Okay. I'll be waiting, Sister.

00:01:21.213 --> 00:01:22.315
Have all the kids arrived?

00:01:23.349 --> 00:01:24.517
Except for one.

00:01:40.967 --> 00:01:43.369
Wrap things up? What do you mean?

00:01:43.936 --> 00:01:44.804
Actually,

00:01:46.238 --> 00:01:47.807
there was a bit of a hassle.

00:01:48.341 --> 00:01:49.542
But it'll be taken care of.

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:52.144
It'll be fine.

00:02:00.553 --> 00:02:01.487
Hello?

00:02:03.055 --> 00:02:04.023
Ah Hyun?

00:02:18.971 --> 00:02:19.939
Are you okay?

00:02:20.473 --> 00:02:21.374
Yes.

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.109

the staff's guidance...

00:02:57.109 --> 00:02:59.512

parents, please follow
the staff's guidance...

00:03:03.616 --> 00:03:05.584

00:03:05.584 --> 00:03:06.519
We'll be back.

We've arrived at the back entrance.

You're working so hard.

The delivery's here.

00:03:38.884 --> 00:03:41.187
Let's check. Could you open the trunk?

00:03:46.626 --> 00:03:48.194
Follow me.

00:03:48.928 --> 00:03:50.329
Come this way.

00:03:56.135 --> 00:03:57.637
Open it quickly.

00:04:00.406 --> 00:04:01.907
You'd better not open it.

00:04:10.416 --> 00:04:11.384
What the...

00:04:19.925 --> 00:04:21.427
We have to find Kim Se Hee.

00:04:21.427 --> 00:04:23.496
We must stop this
before the refund starts.

00:04:23.496 --> 00:04:25.298
Everyone, stay alert.

00:04:43.382 --> 00:04:44.317
I forgot it.

00:04:44.317 --> 00:04:45.117
Damn it.

00:04:48.587 --> 00:04:50.222
- She's nuts.
- Who are you?

00:04:50.489 --> 00:04:53.526
I thought this was the bathroom.

00:04:53.526 --> 00:04:55.528
Bathroom? Don't be ridiculous.
What are you?

00:04:55.528 --> 00:04:57.263
- Hey, don't touch me.
- What's your problem?

00:04:57.263 --> 00:04:58.130
Look.

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:06.172

Now, please follow our instructions.
Follow us.

to follow them?

Why do they keep telling us to come out?

Come quickly.

00:07:36.589 --> 00:07:38.224
You'll be abandoned too anyway.

00:07:38.224 --> 00:07:39.125
You know that.

00:07:53.739 --> 00:07:54.674
I know that too.

00:08:21.701 --> 00:08:24.170
Yes. I, Yoo Han Gyeol,

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:26.539
agree to disown
and dispose of Yoo Hae Yoon,

00:08:26.539 --> 00:08:28.507
whom I adopted 17 years ago.

I, Choi Seong Sil,

00:08:29.875 --> 00:08:32.845
agree to disown
and dispose of Jo A Ra.

Refund reasons? There are too many.

00:08:35.047 --> 00:08:37.383
The kid had too much acne.

00:08:37.383 --> 00:08:39.085
They say acne is hereditary too, right?

00:08:39.251 --> 00:08:41.420
I wondered what the issue was.

00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:43.789
I can't even.

00:08:44.724 --> 00:08:47.860
As expected, it was defective.

00:08:48.194 --> 00:08:51.130
The kid was always catching colds
and fevers.

00:08:52.098 --> 00:08:54.600
My wife had a really hard time
raising the kid.

00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:58.204
Since we're changing anyway,
we want one with better fortune this time.

00:08:58.771 --> 00:09:00.072
Will you match horoscopes for us too?

00:09:02.975 --> 00:09:04.176
I...

00:09:05.578 --> 00:09:07.113
don't really have anything to say.

00:09:08.047 --> 00:09:11.250
Our child is very ill.

00:09:14.186 --> 00:09:16.255
She was fine
when we first brought her home.

00:09:16.822 --> 00:09:19.325
Then she was suddenly diagnosed
with a rare disease.

00:09:20.326 --> 00:09:22.128
There's medicine that can cure her.

00:09:24.997 --> 00:09:27.266
A few injections will do it,

00:09:28.234 --> 00:09:29.368
but it costs one million dollars.

00:09:31.103 --> 00:09:33.940
Do you know what my first thought was
when I heard that?

00:09:34.774 --> 00:09:36.642
The price we paid for Eun Jo.

00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:40.046
That figure came to mind immediately.

00:09:41.147 --> 00:09:42.281
Adding that...

00:09:44.417 --> 00:09:47.653
to the million dollars for treatment,
I wondered how much it all came to.

00:09:48.688 --> 00:09:50.856
Calculating it like that,

00:09:52.024 --> 00:09:53.592
I truly...

00:09:54.527 --> 00:09:55.828
felt disgusted with myself.

00:09:57.863 --> 00:09:59.432
When you raise a child,

00:10:00.299 --> 00:10:01.634
there are precious,

00:10:03.636 --> 00:10:05.037
overwhelming moments...

00:10:05.705 --> 00:10:07.006
that money can never buy...

00:10:09.675 --> 00:10:11.277
no matter what.

00:10:12.511 --> 00:10:13.479
And...

00:10:15.147 --> 00:10:17.316
while raising Eun Jo, I've experienced...

00:10:19.885 --> 00:10:21.487
so many of those moments.

00:10:24.056 --> 00:10:25.224
But...

00:10:28.761 --> 00:10:31.464
in front of that million-dollar price tag,
I thought those things.

00:10:32.965 --> 00:10:34.500
But I don't think like that anymore.

00:10:35.468 --> 00:10:37.003
I realized...

00:10:39.372 --> 00:10:40.806
I'm Eun Jo's mom.

00:10:45.778 --> 00:10:46.812
How did it go?

00:10:47.313 --> 00:10:48.547
It'll be taken care of soon.

00:10:50.049 --> 00:10:50.950
Let's go.

00:10:59.925 --> 00:11:01.661
Here she comes.

00:11:01.661 --> 00:11:03.329
You've arrived.

00:11:08.301 --> 00:11:09.835
I see everyone's here.

00:11:09.835 --> 00:11:11.771
We're done here, right?

00:11:11.771 --> 00:11:15.174
Still, it's the last time,
so you should say your goodbyes properly.

00:11:15.174 --> 00:11:16.943
Goodbyes? What goodbyes?

00:11:16.943 --> 00:11:19.312
This whole thing feels wrong
and uncomfortable.

00:11:19.312 --> 00:11:22.048
Are you trying to make us feel guilty now?

00:11:22.048 --> 00:11:23.549
Do you feel guilty?

00:11:25.618 --> 00:11:29.288
You shouldn't feel that yet.
We haven't even started.

00:11:29.288 --> 00:11:30.656
You haven't even paid the price yet.

00:11:32.491 --> 00:11:34.293
Let's share the guilt now.

00:11:38.731 --> 00:11:40.533
- Guns?
- What's that for?

00:11:40.533 --> 00:11:41.634
Today,

00:11:41.934 --> 00:11:44.870
all of you must kill your own children.

00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:47.073
This isn't what we agreed on.

00:11:47.073 --> 00:11:49.375
If this is how it is,
I want to cancel the refund.

00:11:49.375 --> 00:11:51.978
You're telling us to murder?
This doesn't make any sense.

00:11:51.978 --> 00:11:53.245
I'm canceling the refund.

00:11:53.245 --> 00:11:54.447
Please cancel it.

00:11:58.884 --> 00:12:00.720
They were products from the start.

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:02.288
You paid for them, didn't you?

00:12:02.622 --> 00:12:05.224
Why are you treating them
like people now and trying to back out?

00:12:05.224 --> 00:12:07.727
Still, you're telling us to kill?

00:12:07.727 --> 00:12:09.328
This is insane, isn't it?

00:12:13.833 --> 00:12:16.669
Don't overthink it.

00:12:16.669 --> 00:12:18.037
Don't be scared.

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:22.308
Come on.

00:12:23.242 --> 00:12:24.744
Even animals are categorized...

00:12:25.378 --> 00:12:28.514
as livestock or wild animals
based on usefulness.

00:12:29.081 --> 00:12:30.549
It's the same with humans.

00:12:31.684 --> 00:12:34.253
If you're going to raise them at home,
they should be useful.

00:12:35.488 --> 00:12:37.456
Think of it simply.

00:12:37.456 --> 00:12:39.525
You're slaughtering them
because they've outlived their use.

00:12:40.326 --> 00:12:42.261
I plan to clean up...

00:12:42.261 --> 00:12:44.997
this dirty business today.

00:12:44.997 --> 00:12:46.866
That's why we needed customers like you.

00:12:47.733 --> 00:12:48.701
Murder.

00:12:50.036 --> 00:12:51.170
Solicitation of murder.

00:12:52.204 --> 00:12:53.506
Complicity in murder.

00:12:54.707 --> 00:12:55.875
You know,

00:12:56.609 --> 00:12:57.910
those are serious crimes.

00:12:59.278 --> 00:13:02.481
Now we're all on the same boat.

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:08.888
This is insane.

00:13:08.888 --> 00:13:11.223
All rumors about purchased adoptions...

00:13:11.624 --> 00:13:13.626
will disappear here.

00:13:13.859 --> 00:13:15.328
Of course, I'll participate too.

00:13:16.295 --> 00:13:17.330
Today,

00:13:18.097 --> 00:13:19.165
I'm going to kill...

00:13:20.099 --> 00:13:21.367
my own child today too.

00:13:22.835 --> 00:13:23.936
I can't do it.

00:13:24.303 --> 00:13:25.438
I'm leaving.

00:13:25.438 --> 00:13:27.540
This isn't right.
This doesn't make any sense.

00:13:29.542 --> 00:13:31.744
- Let go.
- Bring her here.

00:13:32.178 --> 00:13:33.179
Let go!

00:13:33.179 --> 00:13:34.080
Mom.

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:35.948
- Eun Jo.
- Eun Jo!

00:13:40.019 --> 00:13:40.920
No.

00:13:41.821 --> 00:13:43.923
- Don't do it.
- Please.

00:13:47.259 --> 00:13:50.496

Everyone, please gather at the center
of the campground.

00:13:58.070 --> 00:13:59.672
Move toward the campfire.

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:37.576
What can you give to your parents?

00:14:38.644 --> 00:14:40.780
What kind of child can you be for them?

00:14:41.113 --> 00:14:43.115
Shall we talk about it?

00:14:43.115 --> 00:14:44.417
Now, who wants to go first?

00:14:44.417 --> 00:14:45.584
I'll go first.

00:14:49.221 --> 00:14:52.158
My parents really love me,

00:14:52.458 --> 00:14:54.226
and they truly care for me.

00:14:54.393 --> 00:14:56.929
When do you feel
that your parents love you?

00:14:58.965 --> 00:15:00.766
When I throw the ball well,

00:15:01.767 --> 00:15:04.370
Mom and Dad were really happy.

00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:07.139
And every time, I felt so encouraged.

00:15:07.807 --> 00:15:08.941
I see.

00:15:09.609 --> 00:15:12.745
But even though
I can't play sports anymore,

00:15:13.579 --> 00:15:14.981
whatever I do,

00:15:14.981 --> 00:15:17.617
I'm sure they'll always support
and cheer me on.

00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:21.854
I used to be
a professional baseball player.

00:15:22.922 --> 00:15:25.091
I trained desperately
and made it into the team,

00:15:26.459 --> 00:15:28.260
but I realized that going from the second
to the first league wasn't...

00:15:29.228 --> 00:15:31.330
something effort alone could achieve.

00:15:31.897 --> 00:15:33.265
No matter how hard I tried,

00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:38.104
I couldn't catch up
to players born with talent.

00:15:39.238 --> 00:15:41.707
So I gave up my dream
of being a baseball player.

00:15:42.642 --> 00:15:44.410
Do Hyun, what do you want to do now?

00:15:44.944 --> 00:15:47.046
Honestly, I haven't thought
about it in detail.

00:15:48.648 --> 00:15:50.516
But I think I really enjoy taking photos.

00:15:51.951 --> 00:15:53.586
Even while I was playing sports,
whenever I had time,

00:15:53.586 --> 00:15:55.321
I'd take pictures of my friends,

00:15:56.355 --> 00:15:58.190
and I really enjoyed it.

00:15:58.190 --> 00:15:59.492
Both my wife and I dream...

00:15:59.792 --> 00:16:01.827
of sending our son to the Major League.

00:16:02.662 --> 00:16:06.032
So we'd like to meet a child...

00:16:09.635 --> 00:16:10.870
who has that potential.

00:16:31.257 --> 00:16:32.358
What's this?

00:16:33.526 --> 00:16:34.961
I'm not pregnant.

00:16:36.629 --> 00:16:38.331
I never had the procedure either.

00:16:39.532 --> 00:16:40.733
What are you talking about?

00:16:41.801 --> 00:16:42.768
However,

00:16:43.936 --> 00:16:45.938
a baby might still be born.

00:16:46.706 --> 00:16:48.240
What do you mean?

00:16:49.008 --> 00:16:50.242
From the beginning,

00:16:51.344 --> 00:16:53.679
Mom never planned
to use my egg to make a baby.

00:16:54.313 --> 00:16:55.948
She planned to use her own.

00:16:59.752 --> 00:17:00.786
What?

00:17:01.887 --> 00:17:03.656
In the lab,

00:17:04.924 --> 00:17:05.791
there are hundreds,

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:09.862
no, thousands of her eggs stored.

00:17:10.496 --> 00:17:13.466
She collects sperms
from men with excellent genes,

00:17:14.367 --> 00:17:17.003
combines them with her own genes,
and creates exceptional children.

00:17:18.671 --> 00:17:20.906
Using countless surrogates to create them,

00:17:21.674 --> 00:17:22.708
dispose of them,

00:17:24.844 --> 00:17:25.945
create more,

00:17:26.912 --> 00:17:28.247
and dispose of them again.

00:17:29.048 --> 00:17:30.516
That's how...

00:17:31.917 --> 00:17:32.885
I was made.

00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:35.788
And also, your child...

00:17:35.788 --> 00:17:37.056
Wait. Stop.

00:17:43.162 --> 00:17:45.264
So you're telling me, Sister,

00:17:46.732 --> 00:17:47.900
I mean,

00:17:48.901 --> 00:17:49.969
that woman was...

00:17:53.272 --> 00:17:54.774
trying to make...

00:17:57.009 --> 00:17:59.145
her own child,

00:17:59.912 --> 00:18:00.913
not mine?

00:18:01.847 --> 00:18:02.782
She dared...

00:18:03.983 --> 00:18:06.085
to deceive me and my husband?

00:18:10.589 --> 00:18:12.158
She's a total lunatic.

00:18:16.262 --> 00:18:18.230
Unbelievable. Damn it.

00:18:23.002 --> 00:18:25.304
But why are you telling me this?

00:18:29.809 --> 00:18:31.010
What's going on?

00:18:31.010 --> 00:18:32.645
What's this?

00:18:39.385 --> 00:18:40.720
Damn it.

00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:41.554
Hey.

00:18:42.521 --> 00:18:43.522
Did you take a hit?

00:18:52.531 --> 00:18:55.901
Everyone, thank you for waiting.

00:19:01.173 --> 00:19:03.676
We will now begin the game.

00:19:10.549 --> 00:19:13.686
The survival game begins now.

00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:15.621
Mom.

00:19:20.726 --> 00:19:21.661
Mom.

00:19:23.562 --> 00:19:25.464
The rules are simple.

00:19:25.464 --> 00:19:28.267
Don't die. Just survive.

00:19:28.834 --> 00:19:30.436
If you get shot, you die.

00:19:30.436 --> 00:19:31.103
Dad.

00:19:31.103 --> 00:19:33.472
- As you run and hide from the bullets,
- Lift your gun.

00:19:33.472 --> 00:19:35.074
- you'll come to realize...
- Mom.

00:19:35.074 --> 00:19:36.776
- Mom.
- that surviving isn't...

00:19:36.776 --> 00:19:38.444
easy at all.

00:19:39.378 --> 00:19:42.214
Right, and one more rule.

00:19:43.082 --> 00:19:46.986
No matter what,
you must never call "Mom" or "Dad."

00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:54.226
If you have a gun but don't shoot,
you die.

00:19:58.097 --> 00:19:59.231
Stay still.

00:19:59.231 --> 00:20:00.466
Just stay still.

00:20:00.633 --> 00:20:01.701
Dad.

00:20:02.368 --> 00:20:05.504
Now, let's start the game.

00:20:05.504 --> 00:20:06.372
Ready.

00:20:07.139 --> 00:20:09.108
Set. Go.

00:20:09.108 --> 00:20:10.176
Don't.

00:20:10.176 --> 00:20:11.110
Five.

00:20:11.544 --> 00:20:12.878
I'll study hard.

00:20:13.145 --> 00:20:14.113
Mom.

00:20:14.113 --> 00:20:14.880
Four.

00:20:18.884 --> 00:20:19.585
Three.

00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:21.887
Mom.

00:20:22.088 --> 00:20:23.155
- Two.
- I'm sorry.

00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:25.291
One.

00:20:40.039 --> 00:20:41.807
Do Hyun!

00:20:46.045 --> 00:20:47.546
What are you doing?

00:20:47.546 --> 00:20:48.514
Are you insane?

00:20:53.686 --> 00:20:54.620
I'll be...

00:20:56.389 --> 00:20:58.758
the selfish mom who saves Eun Jo.

00:21:05.131 --> 00:21:05.998
Eun Jo is...

00:21:06.999 --> 00:21:08.534
here.

00:21:11.537 --> 00:21:12.738
If I shoot you,

00:21:14.707 --> 00:21:16.475
they'll let Eun Jo live.

00:21:43.436 --> 00:21:45.438
Eun Jo!

00:21:46.372 --> 00:21:48.441
- Eun Jo.
- Eun Jo.

00:21:48.441 --> 00:21:50.576
- Eun Jo!
- No.

00:21:52.011 --> 00:21:52.878
No.

00:21:53.813 --> 00:21:55.581
You said you'd save her!

00:21:55.581 --> 00:21:56.849
But she's alive!

00:22:07.026 --> 00:22:07.927
Move.

00:22:09.095 --> 00:22:10.062
Move!

00:22:11.097 --> 00:22:12.164
Kill me.

00:22:13.199 --> 00:22:16.168
Eun Jo is my daughter.

00:22:22.441 --> 00:22:23.442
Mom!

00:22:25.244 --> 00:22:26.112
Honey!

00:22:28.881 --> 00:22:29.849
Eun Jo.

00:22:31.951 --> 00:22:33.085
I'm...

00:22:34.220 --> 00:22:35.154
sorry.

00:22:36.255 --> 00:22:38.357
Mom.

00:22:38.357 --> 00:22:39.625
I'm sorry...

00:22:41.727 --> 00:22:43.529
for not being a good mom.

00:22:44.130 --> 00:22:45.231
Mom.

00:22:48.935 --> 00:22:50.403
No.

00:22:50.403 --> 00:22:52.605
Honey, wake up.

00:22:52.605 --> 00:22:53.739
Wake up!

00:22:58.277 --> 00:22:59.211
Honey.

00:23:02.381 --> 00:23:03.616
Get Kim Ah Hyun!

00:24:09.415 --> 00:24:10.283
So Mi!

00:24:50.089 --> 00:24:52.058
Ah Hyun.

00:25:03.436 --> 00:25:04.270
So Mi!

00:25:08.341 --> 00:25:09.208
Stop it.

00:25:10.343 --> 00:25:11.344
Ah Hyun.

00:25:21.087 --> 00:25:22.254
Stop it!

00:26:10.403 --> 00:26:11.604
What's a mother?

00:26:14.006 --> 00:26:14.907
Mom.

00:26:17.009 --> 00:26:19.679
If you have nothing to say, hang up.
Useless girl.

00:26:25.985 --> 00:26:27.553
What is a mother?

00:26:28.287 --> 00:26:29.155
But Se Hee,

00:26:30.089 --> 00:26:32.091
I don't need you anymore.

00:26:38.597 --> 00:26:40.933
There are mothers like me in this world...

00:26:42.368 --> 00:26:44.103
and daughters like you...

00:26:45.438 --> 00:26:47.139
who get killed by mothers like me.

00:27:09.495 --> 00:27:10.830
This is the police.

00:27:10.830 --> 00:27:12.732
Kim Se Hee and her organization,

00:27:12.732 --> 00:27:16.769
you are under arrest
for child abduction and confinement,

00:27:16.769 --> 00:27:18.838
murder and solicitation of murder,

00:27:18.838 --> 00:27:21.807
corpse abandonment and mutilation,
child trafficking and kidnapping.

00:27:22.742 --> 00:27:24.210
Drop your weapons and surrender.

00:27:25.077 --> 00:27:26.178
This is a warning.

00:27:26.712 --> 00:27:28.681
Drop your weapons and surrender.

00:27:33.052 --> 00:27:34.253
Put down your guns.

00:27:35.388 --> 00:27:37.223
Drop your weapons and surrender.

00:27:37.223 --> 00:27:39.158
This is a warning.

00:27:39.158 --> 00:27:40.826
If you do not drop your weapons
and surrender,

00:27:40.826 --> 00:27:43.229
- Director, you need to get out of here.
- we will open fire.

- Hello?
- Commissioner.

00:28:05.051 --> 00:28:07.420
You need to clean this up.

00:28:07.420 --> 00:28:09.288
You said you weren't sending
the police today.

00:28:09.288 --> 00:28:10.690
What is this?

00:28:11.624 --> 00:28:13.392
This is not where they're supposed
to be right now.

00:28:13.392 --> 00:28:14.593
I can't even.

00:28:14.593 --> 00:28:15.594
Hey.

00:28:16.228 --> 00:28:18.864
The police are just doing their job,
catching criminals.

00:28:18.864 --> 00:28:20.099
What's wrong with that?

00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:28.474
You need to leave.

00:28:32.111 --> 00:28:33.713
That feels good.

if you help me.

00:28:57.336 --> 00:28:59.071
You have to help me.

00:29:05.378 --> 00:29:07.546
Nice to meet you, Ah Hyun.

00:29:09.715 --> 00:29:10.983
My Mary.

00:29:13.753 --> 00:29:15.554
Drop your weapons and surrender.

I trust you'll handle this cleanly...

without traces.

00:29:33.039 --> 00:29:34.840
Yes, of course.

Don't worry.

00:30:26.025 --> 00:30:27.026
You can...

00:30:27.994 --> 00:30:29.228
abandon me now.

00:30:47.647 --> 00:30:48.547
Go!

00:31:05.064 --> 00:31:07.166
Uncle!

00:31:09.302 --> 00:31:11.804
Uncle.

00:31:12.038 --> 00:31:14.373
Uncle, no!

00:31:15.775 --> 00:31:16.776
Uncle.

00:31:26.819 --> 00:31:28.621
Uncle, no.

00:31:29.922 --> 00:31:31.290
Uncle.

00:31:32.224 --> 00:31:34.060
No. Please no.

00:31:36.662 --> 00:31:37.697
Uncle.

00:31:55.414 --> 00:31:57.249
(Kim Se Hee)

00:31:59.051 --> 00:32:00.052
Hello?

00:32:00.353 --> 00:32:01.420
Madam.

00:32:01.754 --> 00:32:02.755
Sister.

00:32:03.789 --> 00:32:04.690
Right now,

00:32:05.391 --> 00:32:07.793
something seems
to have gone terribly wrong.

00:32:08.728 --> 00:32:11.097
I think the Police Commissioner
misunderstood something.

00:32:11.497 --> 00:32:12.465
Like what?

00:32:12.965 --> 00:32:14.433
I mean,

00:32:14.433 --> 00:32:17.169
I'm supposedly being arrested
by the police or something.

00:32:18.004 --> 00:32:19.171
Just...

00:32:19.872 --> 00:32:21.407
shut your mouth and die.

00:32:22.408 --> 00:32:24.210
Then you won't get arrested.

00:33:01.847 --> 00:33:03.683
(Kiss Café)

00:33:09.722 --> 00:33:11.290
Yes, this is Kiss Café.

00:33:12.258 --> 00:33:13.259
Mom.

00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:15.695
Who is this?

00:33:16.262 --> 00:33:17.263
Mom.

00:33:18.297 --> 00:33:20.633
It's Se Hee.

00:33:23.536 --> 00:33:24.837
But there are a dozen Se Hees.

00:33:26.639 --> 00:33:28.741
Hey, which Se Hee are you?

00:33:29.208 --> 00:33:31.277
Ahn Se Hee? Kim Se Hee? Choi Se Hee?

00:33:34.180 --> 00:33:35.481
Kim Se Hee.

00:33:37.383 --> 00:33:38.584
Why did you call?

00:33:39.352 --> 00:33:40.353
Do you need money?

00:33:41.253 --> 00:33:43.022
No, I...

00:33:44.824 --> 00:33:47.627
If you've got nothing to say, hang up.
Useless girl.

00:33:58.504 --> 00:34:00.473
Did you call to tell on us
to the woman at the café?

00:34:01.240 --> 00:34:03.309
Guys, do you know
why her name is Kim Se Hee?

00:34:03.576 --> 00:34:05.177
The director told me.

00:34:12.618 --> 00:34:13.586
Mom.

00:34:15.021 --> 00:34:15.855
Hey.

00:34:27.533 --> 00:34:28.467
Mom.

00:34:29.135 --> 00:34:30.069
Here.

00:34:30.636 --> 00:34:32.939
Se Hee,
do you know why your name is Se Hee?

00:34:33.506 --> 00:34:34.407
No.

00:34:35.141 --> 00:34:37.310
Remember the story I told you long ago...

00:34:37.643 --> 00:34:39.845
about that Miss Park I used to work with?

00:34:40.913 --> 00:34:44.083
The one who married a rich guy
and turned her life around.

00:34:44.083 --> 00:34:45.084
Right.

00:34:45.451 --> 00:34:46.852
Her name was Se Hee.

00:34:49.121 --> 00:34:51.457
I wanted to be like her.

00:34:51.457 --> 00:34:53.592
That's why I named you Se Hee.

00:34:53.592 --> 00:34:56.062
I thought if I kept calling that name,
I might become like her too.

00:34:56.062 --> 00:34:56.996
I see.

00:34:57.630 --> 00:34:58.698
But Se Hee,

00:34:59.398 --> 00:35:01.434
I don't need you anymore.

00:35:05.204 --> 00:35:07.239
I think I'm finally going
to get lucky myself.

00:35:10.309 --> 00:35:12.478
Someone will come
and fix things for you somehow.

00:35:12.845 --> 00:35:14.380
So behave.

00:35:14.614 --> 00:35:15.615
Bye now.

00:35:18.517 --> 00:35:19.518
Mom.

00:35:22.788 --> 00:35:23.856
Mom.

00:35:43.042 --> 00:35:45.111
I went through so much to make this.

00:35:45.778 --> 00:35:46.679
I...

00:35:48.114 --> 00:35:50.016
I put everything into this.

00:36:11.470 --> 00:36:14.273
What do they think they're doing?

00:36:14.974 --> 00:36:17.109
Do they think
I'm going to collapse like this?

00:36:25.685 --> 00:36:27.086
Do you think that'll be perfect?

00:36:31.757 --> 00:36:32.658
Honey.

00:36:34.093 --> 00:36:35.127
My girl.

00:36:36.262 --> 00:36:37.196
You're here.

00:36:38.664 --> 00:36:40.666
You just want to believe it's perfect.

00:36:45.404 --> 00:36:46.272
You're...

00:36:48.374 --> 00:36:51.344
just making another child
who looks like you.

00:37:19.972 --> 00:37:22.074
That "perfect being" you talk about is...

00:37:24.277 --> 00:37:26.178
someone who isn't even you.

00:37:28.648 --> 00:37:30.383
Born to proper parents,

00:37:30.950 --> 00:37:32.285
raised differently from you,

00:37:33.252 --> 00:37:34.987
given nothing but love,

00:37:35.855 --> 00:37:37.123
and growing up...

00:37:38.257 --> 00:37:39.959
to shine brilliantly, unlike you.

00:37:40.793 --> 00:37:42.295
Shut up!

00:37:43.095 --> 00:37:44.830
You reek.

00:37:46.999 --> 00:37:48.567
The stench is overwhelming.

00:37:50.736 --> 00:37:51.938
You thought I didn't know?

00:37:54.674 --> 00:37:57.109
That rotting stench comes...

00:37:57.877 --> 00:37:59.879
from your festering inferiority complex.

00:37:59.879 --> 00:38:03.816
No.

00:38:05.418 --> 00:38:07.386
You said all a child needs is love...

00:38:08.354 --> 00:38:12.024
and that just looking at them
with loving eyes is enough.

00:38:12.925 --> 00:38:14.393
Then why didn't you do that for me?

00:38:17.263 --> 00:38:18.364
I thought maybe,

00:38:19.065 --> 00:38:21.400
you'd regret having abandoned me.

00:38:22.902 --> 00:38:24.570
I hoped you'd wonder...

00:38:26.405 --> 00:38:28.240
if I might still be alive.

00:38:30.409 --> 00:38:32.211
If I'd known you were this pathetic,

00:38:33.546 --> 00:38:35.214
I wouldn't have missed you so much.

00:38:36.649 --> 00:38:38.684
I should've just hated you...

00:38:40.353 --> 00:38:41.687
and loathed you.

00:38:44.156 --> 00:38:46.225
I regret ever expecting anything.

00:38:57.036 --> 00:38:58.237
You lost...

00:39:01.207 --> 00:39:02.308
completely.

00:39:08.948 --> 00:39:11.083
This morning, the Seoul Central District
Prosecutors' Office...

00:39:11.083 --> 00:39:14.253
raided SH Medical Foundation.

00:39:14.253 --> 00:39:18.524
As the so-called
"Kim Se Hee Gate" breaks open...

00:39:18.524 --> 00:39:20.526
over the late Kim Se Hee's illegal
adoption trafficking,

00:39:20.526 --> 00:39:22.895
the political and business sectors are
on high alert,

00:39:22.895 --> 00:39:26.198
and attention is focused on whether
further allegations will be revealed.

00:39:28.534 --> 00:39:30.102
Untie us.

00:39:30.102 --> 00:39:31.637
Hurry and untie us.

00:39:35.841 --> 00:39:37.376
That bastard caught us.

00:39:37.376 --> 00:39:38.744
He's a total psychopath.

00:39:42.715 --> 00:39:43.749
Don't move!

00:39:47.219 --> 00:39:48.054
Stop.

00:40:00.633 --> 00:40:03.436
(GED,
College Entrance)

00:40:03.636 --> 00:40:06.305
(2 years later)

00:40:09.675 --> 00:40:11.310
(Song Again)

00:40:12.445 --> 00:40:13.412
Hey.

00:40:15.047 --> 00:40:15.815
Mom.

00:40:17.049 --> 00:40:17.984
Si Woo.

00:40:19.518 --> 00:40:21.387
It must've been tough. How was it?

00:40:21.387 --> 00:40:22.822
- It was hard.
- What was?

00:40:22.822 --> 00:40:24.357
Math was really tough.

00:40:24.357 --> 00:40:26.392
Still, you have to do it.

00:40:26.392 --> 00:40:28.094
- Let's go eat.
- Let's go.

00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:36.369
(Song Again)

00:40:36.569 --> 00:40:37.637
Yu Na.

00:40:37.637 --> 00:40:40.573
Either eat or sing. Pick one.

00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:43.509
Why am I still so nervous
when I've auditioned so many times?

00:40:44.076 --> 00:40:45.578
I'm nervous too.

00:40:45.578 --> 00:40:48.047
Si Woo, do you think
I'll do well this time?

00:40:48.047 --> 00:40:50.149
Of course, because you're my sister.

00:40:50.583 --> 00:40:52.385
Of course, because you're my daughter.

00:40:53.619 --> 00:40:58.057
Si Woo, after we drop her off,
do you want to go to the amusement park?

00:40:58.057 --> 00:40:58.991
Really?

00:40:58.991 --> 00:41:01.060
What? I'm going too.

00:41:01.060 --> 00:41:02.862
We were going just the two of us today.

00:41:02.862 --> 00:41:06.499
Come on, Mom.
That's not fair. I'm going too.

00:41:06.499 --> 00:41:09.101
Should we wait a little, then go together?

00:41:10.436 --> 00:41:11.270
Yes.

00:41:12.071 --> 00:41:14.373
All right, we'll all go together then.

00:41:14.674 --> 00:41:16.475
- Okay.
- Okay.

00:41:24.884 --> 00:41:27.053
Seriously, Tae Sik?

00:41:27.053 --> 00:41:28.487
Is this place just made for you?

00:41:28.487 --> 00:41:31.424
How does your face keep getting better
every time I see you?

00:41:33.359 --> 00:41:34.694
Don't be ridiculous.

00:41:35.294 --> 00:41:36.295
Is everything all right?

00:41:36.629 --> 00:41:38.364
Is anyone bothering you here?

00:41:38.364 --> 00:41:40.232
If there is, tell me. I'll handle it.

00:41:42.568 --> 00:41:45.137
What about you? Are you studying hard?

00:41:45.871 --> 00:41:49.408
Come on, of course I'm...

00:41:49.775 --> 00:41:50.776
not.

00:41:52.078 --> 00:41:53.746
I'm just living life as a fanboy,
that's all.

00:41:55.114 --> 00:41:56.515
What's fun these days?

00:41:57.483 --> 00:41:58.618
These days,

00:42:00.519 --> 00:42:02.688
console games are really fun.

00:42:03.723 --> 00:42:06.192
I even bought a ton of game cartridges
to play with you.

00:42:06.926 --> 00:42:11.030
Wait. Around the time you get out...

00:42:11.030 --> 00:42:13.165
Two? Three?

00:42:13.165 --> 00:42:15.835
Maybe even season four will be released.

00:42:22.775 --> 00:42:24.043
Are the kids...

00:42:24.710 --> 00:42:25.745
doing okay?

00:42:26.379 --> 00:42:27.747
Of course.

00:42:28.614 --> 00:42:30.850
Tomorrow we're all going to see Seok Su.

00:42:35.921 --> 00:42:37.223
I wish I could come with you.

00:42:37.990 --> 00:42:40.626
Join us next time.

00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:41.794
Promise.

00:42:42.862 --> 00:42:45.031
Pinky promise.

00:42:45.031 --> 00:42:46.265
I'll do it. Promise.

00:42:48.501 --> 00:42:49.435
Promise.

00:43:02.748 --> 00:43:05.284
Seok Su, it's really nice here.

00:43:07.420 --> 00:43:08.754
Just like we promised,

00:43:11.023 --> 00:43:11.824
we came.

00:43:19.332 --> 00:43:20.633
I really miss you, Seok Su.

00:43:59.605 --> 00:44:00.906
Guys, here.

00:44:02.108 --> 00:44:03.576
It's here.

00:44:03.576 --> 00:44:06.178
This is no joke. It's eight servings.

00:44:07.480 --> 00:44:09.682
There's so much meat,

00:44:09.682 --> 00:44:12.051
and it's supposed to be a housewarming,
but it feels kind of empty.

00:44:12.051 --> 00:44:14.987
There's only meat.
It doesn't really feel right.

00:44:14.987 --> 00:44:15.955
I like it.

00:44:15.955 --> 00:44:18.424
Still, it does feel a bit empty.

00:44:18.824 --> 00:44:21.560
Do you want me to make some ramyeon?

00:44:23.763 --> 00:44:25.831
I seriously almost threw up just now.

00:44:25.831 --> 00:44:27.466
Even hearing
the word "ramyeon" makes me gag.

00:44:27.466 --> 00:44:29.201
Seriously.

00:44:29.201 --> 00:44:31.404
But wait, I think I smell fried chicken.

00:44:31.404 --> 00:44:33.105
Si Woo, you're amazing.

00:44:33.105 --> 00:44:34.507
How did you know?

00:44:34.507 --> 00:44:35.541
Ta-da.

00:44:36.342 --> 00:44:38.377
- Really?
- Ah Hyun.

00:44:38.377 --> 00:44:41.247
Thank you. Is this really for me?

00:44:42.214 --> 00:44:43.849
- Don't be like that.
- Let's eat together.

00:44:45.451 --> 00:44:46.585
Who's taking the drumstick?

00:44:46.585 --> 00:44:48.587
- Me.
- All right. Si Woo.

00:44:48.587 --> 00:44:50.923
And you, Ah Hyun.

00:44:51.757 --> 00:44:53.793
Yes, let me try a drumstick too.

00:44:53.793 --> 00:44:55.027
And for our youngest.

00:44:56.228 --> 00:44:59.432
So Mi gets this one.
This is a drumstick too.

00:45:00.766 --> 00:45:02.134
This part is super dry.

00:45:03.135 --> 00:45:04.770
Just kidding. I'll give you a wing.

00:45:05.471 --> 00:45:08.007
The night view is really pretty here.

00:45:08.007 --> 00:45:09.141
Should we take a selfie together?

00:45:10.109 --> 00:45:11.010
Should we?

00:45:11.444 --> 00:45:12.612
Okay, I'll take a picture.

00:45:13.212 --> 00:45:15.181
One, two, three.

00:45:43.743 --> 00:45:47.346
(The Defects,
Epilogue)

00:45:48.314 --> 00:45:49.582
You lost.

00:45:51.117 --> 00:45:52.184
Completely.

00:46:03.262 --> 00:46:04.230
I love you.

00:46:05.364 --> 00:46:06.332
Mom.

00:46:55.881 --> 00:46:57.249
Crazy bitch.

00:47:15.067 --> 00:47:19.071
(Thank you for supporting
