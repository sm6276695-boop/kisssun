00:00:53.375 --> 00:00:54.166
Hurry, chase them!

00:00:54.541 --> 00:00:55.291
Wait!

00:00:56.583 --> 00:00:58.041
No need to chase.

00:01:07.166 --> 00:01:09.666
Where is Prince Kang’s old corpse?

00:01:10.458 --> 00:01:11.291
Your Highness.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.041
His Highness is inside.

00:01:14.666 --> 00:01:16.166
That old fox.

00:01:16.458 --> 00:01:19.208
He fought me his whole life.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.541
Now he’s dead.

00:01:20.666 --> 00:01:22.791
I should see him off one last time.

00:01:23.166 --> 00:01:24.250
Lead the way.

00:01:35.041 --> 00:01:36.833
Prince Kang, oh Prince Kang.

00:01:36.916 --> 00:01:38.416
You old bastard.

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.125
You fought me all your life.

00:01:41.333 --> 00:01:44.750
In the end, you still died by my hand.

00:01:49.208 --> 00:01:51.291
I must kill that old traitor.

00:01:55.208 --> 00:01:56.625
Right now, the most important thing

00:01:57.791 --> 00:02:00.041
is to stop his plot from succeeding.

00:02:03.541 --> 00:02:04.833
Someone just came to mind.

00:02:05.083 --> 00:02:06.375
Maybe he can help us.

00:02:06.833 --> 00:02:07.750
I’ll take you to meet him.

00:02:08.041 --> 00:02:08.958
Li Jingnian.

00:02:10.916 --> 00:02:11.916
Don’t you think

00:02:12.291 --> 00:02:14.958
everything seems connected?

00:02:15.541 --> 00:02:17.250
Doesn’t it feel off?

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:23.250
Lin Xiaoran.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.291
I brought you to Chang’an.

00:02:25.916 --> 00:02:26.916
Now,

00:02:27.291 --> 00:02:29.125
Shen Qiuwan is missing.

00:02:30.416 --> 00:02:31.458
Sorry.

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:36.208
It’s fine.

00:02:38.291 --> 00:02:39.750
As long as it’s your decision,

00:02:41.291 --> 00:02:42.250
I’ll follow you.

00:02:44.333 --> 00:02:45.000
Mm.

00:02:45.125 --> 00:02:45.750
Let’s go.

00:02:49.458 --> 00:02:51.333
Lord Li, it’s been a while.

00:02:51.583 --> 00:02:52.541
What brings you here?

00:02:52.666 --> 00:02:53.625
General Song.

00:02:53.916 --> 00:02:55.625
I know my foster father trusted you.

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.708
Now Eunuch Qiu’s ambition to seize the throne

00:02:58.875 --> 00:03:00.166
is clear to everyone.

00:03:01.041 --> 00:03:02.125
And my foster father

00:03:02.791 --> 00:03:03.958
has already passed away.

00:03:04.041 --> 00:03:04.708
What?

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:06.541
Prince Kang, he...

00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:11.791
I barely escaped with my life.

00:03:12.666 --> 00:03:15.291
General Song, please lend me your support.

00:03:16.083 --> 00:03:17.583
Help me eliminate this traitor.

00:03:19.833 --> 00:03:22.416
The palace will be heavily guarded today.

00:03:23.416 --> 00:03:24.916
Whether we succeed

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:26.500
depends entirely on the Imperial Guards.

00:03:26.583 --> 00:03:28.750
His Highness has deep ties with the Imperial Guards.

00:03:29.208 --> 00:03:31.416
This is our duty.

00:03:32.583 --> 00:03:33.416
However,

00:03:34.208 --> 00:03:36.291
the Imperial Guards aren’t stationed inside the palace.

00:03:36.708 --> 00:03:38.708
Without orders, we can’t enter the palace banquet.

00:03:39.541 --> 00:03:41.500
We can only deploy outside the palace.

00:03:42.666 --> 00:03:43.750
Unless...

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.791
Unless someone inside sends a signal.

00:03:49.208 --> 00:03:50.458
Only then can we act.

00:03:51.416 --> 00:03:52.375
How about this—

00:03:52.833 --> 00:03:54.125
Tomorrow, we split up.

00:03:54.708 --> 00:03:55.833
I’ll find a way into the palace.

00:03:56.041 --> 00:03:57.791
Expose Eunuch Qiu’s tricks.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.833
The rest

00:03:59.125 --> 00:04:00.083
I’ll leave to you.

00:04:00.208 --> 00:04:00.875
No.

00:04:01.375 --> 00:04:02.708
That old eunuch must be prepared inside.

00:04:02.791 --> 00:04:04.083
He’s made thorough preparations.

00:04:04.166 --> 00:04:05.833
It’s too dangerous for you to go alone.

00:04:06.458 --> 00:04:07.208
I’ll go instead.

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:08.125
Lin Xiaoran.

00:04:08.916 --> 00:04:09.833
You know

00:04:10.416 --> 00:04:12.291
I’m more suited for the palace than you.

00:04:27.041 --> 00:04:27.458
Lord Wang.

00:04:27.541 --> 00:04:27.958
Lord Li.

00:04:28.833 --> 00:04:29.541
Please, please.

00:04:29.625 --> 00:04:30.333
Lord Li, after you.

00:04:30.375 --> 00:04:31.375
It’s been a long time.

00:04:32.625 --> 00:04:33.500
How have you been lately?

00:04:33.583 --> 00:04:34.625
Very well, very well.

00:04:34.708 --> 00:04:35.083
Lord Sun.

00:04:35.125 --> 00:04:37.083
You look great after just a few days.

00:04:39.375 --> 00:04:42.125
At today’s palace banquet, we must share two cups.

00:04:44.166 --> 00:04:45.000
Not at all.

00:04:45.541 --> 00:04:46.333
You flatter me.

00:04:46.416 --> 00:04:48.791
I heard Lord Sun is busy with official duties today.

00:04:49.541 --> 00:04:50.708
Li Jingnian.

00:04:53.541 --> 00:04:55.000
I come from the martial world.

00:04:55.916 --> 00:04:57.250
Before I met you,

00:04:57.708 --> 00:04:59.791
I was always a wanderer in the martial world.

00:05:01.083 --> 00:05:02.500
These past months have been joyful.

00:05:03.291 --> 00:05:04.708
Once this is over,

00:05:05.166 --> 00:05:06.750
come travel the martial world with me.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:08.708
Sure.

00:05:10.666 --> 00:05:11.708
I’ll head out first.

00:05:17.458 --> 00:05:18.041
Hyah!

00:05:21.333 --> 00:05:22.250
Lin Xiaoran.

00:05:22.666 --> 00:05:23.666
Stay within three meters.

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:38.541
Young Hero Lin

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:39.750
Go inside first.

00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:41.708
I’ll do my best to find Lady Shen.

00:05:42.541 --> 00:05:43.250
Yes.

00:05:49.666 --> 00:05:51.083
Why aren’t they here yet?

00:05:51.208 --> 00:05:52.125
Yeah.

00:05:52.291 --> 00:05:54.333
Why haven’t His Majesty and Eunuch Qiu arrived?

00:05:54.375 --> 00:05:55.583
What’s the reason?

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.041
What’s going on?

00:05:58.125 --> 00:05:58.916
I’m not sure.

00:05:59.083 --> 00:06:00.250
Let’s wait a bit longer.

00:06:00.708 --> 00:06:01.750
Could it be...

00:06:03.666 --> 00:06:04.500
Mind your words!

00:06:04.583 --> 00:06:06.125
What time is it already?

00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:25.875
We’re almost dead, yet we’re still eating so well.

00:07:08.583 --> 00:07:09.541
Qiu Wan

00:07:12.333 --> 00:07:13.500
Why are you here?

00:07:14.541 --> 00:07:15.625
Prince Kang

00:07:16.625 --> 00:07:18.458
Prince Kang is still alive.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.666
This is a trap.

00:07:23.625 --> 00:07:25.625
Prince Kang isn't dead, then what about Li Jingnian?

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:27.541
Li Jingnian is in danger.

00:07:27.875 --> 00:07:28.583
Hurry!

00:07:28.708 --> 00:07:29.916
Go save him!

00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:30.791
Forget about Li Jingnian for now.

00:07:30.833 --> 00:07:31.791
Let me get you out first.

00:07:31.833 --> 00:07:32.958
Go save Li Jingnian!

00:07:33.041 --> 00:07:34.333
Let me get you out first.

00:07:34.375 --> 00:07:36.500
Lin Xiaoran, listen to me.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.416
I'm already like this now.

00:07:40.041 --> 00:07:41.791
They won't do anything to me.

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:45.708
Go, or it'll be too late!

00:07:50.833 --> 00:07:51.916
Go!

00:07:52.916 --> 00:07:53.666
Alright.

00:07:55.791 --> 00:07:57.041
I'll go save Li Jingnian first.

00:07:57.083 --> 00:07:58.250
Then I'll come back for you.

00:07:58.708 --> 00:07:59.583
Wait here for me.

00:07:59.625 --> 00:08:00.208
Okay.

00:08:01.291 --> 00:08:02.166
I'll be right back.

00:08:12.583 --> 00:08:13.500
Strange...

00:08:14.416 --> 00:08:16.375
That old fox is always so cautious.

00:08:17.375 --> 00:08:18.750
Why is it today, as I walked here,

00:08:19.458 --> 00:08:20.791
there's no one guarding the palace?

00:08:34.541 --> 00:08:35.666
You're here.

00:08:38.875 --> 00:08:39.750
Foster father.

00:08:41.208 --> 00:08:42.291
You're alive.

00:08:44.041 --> 00:08:45.375
What's going on?

00:08:49.125 --> 00:08:50.791
How are you still alive?

00:08:50.916 --> 00:08:51.541
Guards!

00:08:51.625 --> 00:08:53.041
Kill him!

00:08:54.083 --> 00:08:55.166
Why are you all just standing there?

00:08:55.208 --> 00:08:57.208
I said, kill him!

00:09:05.666 --> 00:09:06.916
So you all...

00:09:08.541 --> 00:09:08.958
You...

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.291
You guessed right.

00:09:10.458 --> 00:09:12.583
They're all my people.

00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:14.583
Even the Taoist by your side

00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:16.291
is one of mine.

00:09:16.416 --> 00:09:17.916
So all of this

00:09:18.291 --> 00:09:20.375
was your scheme.

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:21.416
That's right.

00:09:21.541 --> 00:09:23.208
If I hadn't done this,

00:09:23.416 --> 00:09:25.541
how would you have let your guard down?

00:09:25.666 --> 00:09:27.125
And walked right into my trap?

00:09:27.208 --> 00:09:27.666
You...

00:09:27.708 --> 00:09:29.250
Stop your foolish hopes.

00:09:29.541 --> 00:09:30.833
I deceived you.

00:09:30.916 --> 00:09:31.625
You...

00:09:31.708 --> 00:09:33.208
From beginning to end,

00:09:33.375 --> 00:09:36.541
you were merely a pawn in my scheme.

00:09:37.041 --> 00:09:40.708
Just a stepping stone for my grand ambition.

00:09:40.833 --> 00:09:41.541
You...

00:09:42.833 --> 00:09:43.916
Impossible!

00:09:44.083 --> 00:09:46.250
I'll fight you to the end!

00:10:06.416 --> 00:10:10.583
I'm the true Dragon!

00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:21.416
All of this

00:10:22.333 --> 00:10:23.875
was your plot.

00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:24.750
Yes.

00:10:25.333 --> 00:10:26.166
Why?
