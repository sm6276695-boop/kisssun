00:00:39.706 --> 00:00:41.041
What took you so long?

00:00:42.459 --> 00:00:44.544
-Hyeon-guk, get the fire going.
-Eun-jung!

00:00:45.712 --> 00:00:47.964
-Grab a new one.
-We're firing up the grill.

00:00:49.466 --> 00:00:50.717
Let's talk for a second.

00:00:51.551 --> 00:00:52.927
You can start eating without us.

00:00:53.928 --> 00:00:56.556
Kim Sang-hak, you're supposed to grill!

00:00:56.639 --> 00:00:57.891
Where are you going?

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.325
This letter is adorable.

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:20.288
Is this why you were crying?
Because it brought up old memories?

00:01:22.957 --> 00:01:28.838
I just felt bad
seeing Ms. Yoon like that.

00:01:33.176 --> 00:01:35.720
Since Sang-yeon and I reconnected,

00:01:36.554 --> 00:01:40.266
we haven't had a chance
to really talk about her brother.

00:01:42.644 --> 00:01:45.563
I did ask her about him once though.

00:01:46.064 --> 00:01:49.692
There must be people
who knew him in the past

00:01:50.944 --> 00:01:53.822
who are still unaware that he's gone.

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:01.913
They must think that
he's somewhere, alive and well.

00:02:05.708 --> 00:02:09.295
It's like that for me too.
He never even crosses my mind.

00:02:11.297 --> 00:02:14.717
I figured it was her way of coping,

00:02:14.801 --> 00:02:18.096
but seeing her behavior
towards Ms. Yoon today…

00:02:20.098 --> 00:02:21.808
I really don't get it.

00:02:24.227 --> 00:02:25.687
You felt it too, right?

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:31.943
She deliberately took us there
to hurt Ms. Yoon's feelings.

00:02:36.823 --> 00:02:37.740
That's why…

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.704
I couldn't stand to look at her earlier.

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.835
What did she tell you?
Did she not say anything?

00:02:51.713 --> 00:02:53.965
I'm not sure,

00:02:55.508 --> 00:02:57.802
but she seemed pretty shaken up herself.

00:02:57.886 --> 00:03:02.265
Why do something that's just going to
weigh on your own mind?

00:03:05.101 --> 00:03:06.686
Sang-yeon's brother…

00:03:09.898 --> 00:03:11.149
What happened to him?

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:16.279
It was suicide.

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:20.325
But I don't know why.

00:03:21.826 --> 00:03:27.832
Sang-yeon told me that
Ms. Yoon disapproved of his girlfriend.

00:03:33.046 --> 00:03:35.256
The night before he left…

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.052
I slept over at Sang-yeon's place.

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:45.558
In the middle of the night, he suddenly
offered to teach me how to use a camera.

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:47.227
Eun-jung.

00:03:48.478 --> 00:03:49.520
Yes?

00:03:51.231 --> 00:03:52.065
One second.

00:03:56.903 --> 00:04:01.074
Now that I think about it,
it was an odd thing to do.

00:04:03.076 --> 00:04:06.246
He was acting strange
in more ways than one that day…

00:04:08.414 --> 00:04:10.667
but I missed all the signs.

00:04:12.418 --> 00:04:13.378
Like an idiot.

00:04:14.921 --> 00:04:19.592
Do you actually think it would have made
a difference if you'd caught on?

00:04:23.554 --> 00:04:26.057
That's just not true.

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:28.726
That clover…

00:04:29.769 --> 00:04:30.603
The clover?

00:04:32.605 --> 00:04:35.066
The gift from your father? What about it?

00:04:37.694 --> 00:04:38.778
My dad is…

00:04:41.739 --> 00:04:43.449
He's dead.

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:47.203
I gave him something…

00:04:49.747 --> 00:04:51.291
from someone who was dead.

00:04:51.374 --> 00:04:53.668
Hey, that's absurd.

00:04:54.252 --> 00:04:55.295
Come here.

00:05:04.095 --> 00:05:07.348
Everyone, eat up before it burns.
What's taking them so long?

00:05:07.432 --> 00:05:10.560
I know, right?
Did they have an argument or something?

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:12.770
-No.
-Here they come.

00:05:15.315 --> 00:05:18.860
Where on earth have you been?
Get a move on already.

00:05:18.943 --> 00:05:20.987
Man, I'm the best at grilling.

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:24.032
-You should've hurried, then.
-Come on, show us your skills.

00:05:24.115 --> 00:05:26.242
Hey, mosquito alert.

00:05:26.326 --> 00:05:28.536
Wait, were you crying?

00:05:29.704 --> 00:05:32.332
Oppa, did you make her cry?

00:05:32.415 --> 00:05:33.374
It's not like that.

00:05:33.458 --> 00:05:35.710
Forget it and eat up. Open up.

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:38.880
How is it?

00:05:38.963 --> 00:05:39.964
It's so good.

00:05:40.465 --> 00:05:42.925
You heard her.
Your girlfriend says it's good.

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:45.595
-Duh, I grilled it.
-Do you guys even know good meat?

00:05:48.056 --> 00:05:49.515
-It's burning.
-My bad.

00:05:51.017 --> 00:05:52.560
-Flip that one.
-This one?

00:06:31.182 --> 00:06:35.103
YOU AND EVERYTHING ELSE

00:06:42.902 --> 00:06:47.031
I'll take that. You take the smaller ones.
Take that fan instead.

00:06:52.912 --> 00:06:54.038
-Is it heavy?
-Very.

00:07:02.588 --> 00:07:06.175
All the stuff's moved in.
Shall we get to organizing?

00:07:07.051 --> 00:07:10.179
This room could have been a tad bigger.

00:07:10.263 --> 00:07:13.015
I told her to take the bigger room,
but she's so stubborn.

00:07:17.562 --> 00:07:19.021
-Sang-yeon.
-Yeah?

00:07:19.105 --> 00:07:20.356
Ms. Yoon's calling.

00:07:35.663 --> 00:07:38.040
-Trust me. This is it.
-I got my workout for the day.

00:07:38.124 --> 00:07:40.585
See? We're in the right place.

00:07:40.668 --> 00:07:41.502
Hey!

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:43.963
-This place is great.
-Hi!

00:07:44.046 --> 00:07:45.715
Cheers!

00:07:45.798 --> 00:07:48.634
Don't even think about crashing here
after a night of drinking.

00:07:48.718 --> 00:07:51.137
You two, don't ever let them in.

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:52.889
Of course we won't.

00:07:52.972 --> 00:07:55.683
If we come knocking,
she'll welcome us with open arms.

00:07:55.766 --> 00:07:58.060
-Really?
-And you'll be in the military anyway.

00:07:58.144 --> 00:07:59.604
Don't bring up the m-word.

00:07:59.687 --> 00:08:02.482
-I got a military exemption.
-You mentioned it again!

00:08:02.565 --> 00:08:03.608
-Hi, Jeong-seon!
-Hi!

00:08:03.691 --> 00:08:05.943
Here she is, the loyal one.

00:08:06.444 --> 00:08:08.446
Eun-jung, meet your future.

00:08:08.529 --> 00:08:12.158
She's been flying solo since Kyu-ho left
for the military a month ago.

00:08:12.241 --> 00:08:16.204
Jeong-seon, what's it like sending
your boyfriend off to the military?

00:08:17.288 --> 00:08:18.414
When's he leaving?

00:08:19.624 --> 00:08:20.791
In six days.

00:08:20.875 --> 00:08:24.837
You must be clueless as of now.
Enjoy your last moments, you two.

00:08:24.921 --> 00:08:28.341
You're not planning on sticking around
at home all day, are you?

00:08:28.925 --> 00:08:29.759
Sorry?

00:08:29.842 --> 00:08:35.264
You need to give them some space
so they can be all lovey-dovey.

00:08:35.348 --> 00:08:36.516
Hey, what are you…

00:08:36.599 --> 00:08:38.267
Right.

00:08:38.351 --> 00:08:39.685
Don't worry about us.

00:08:39.769 --> 00:08:41.312
"Don't worry about us."

00:08:43.231 --> 00:08:44.524
We're out of drinks.

00:08:44.607 --> 00:08:45.942
-I'll go buy some.
-Me too.

00:08:46.025 --> 00:08:48.903
Where are you two going?
Off to sneak a kiss?

00:08:49.403 --> 00:08:50.571
Just a kiss?

00:08:51.447 --> 00:08:52.281
What?

00:08:54.033 --> 00:08:57.870
-Man, he's a total pervert.
-I'm cringing so hard.

00:08:57.954 --> 00:09:00.790
Kyu-ho asked me to send him
an electric watch.

00:09:00.873 --> 00:09:02.041
An electric watch?

00:09:02.124 --> 00:09:06.254
Yeah. Not an expensive one
but a simple, black one.

00:09:07.004 --> 00:09:09.173
-Do you know what that is?
-Yeah, they're…

00:09:18.933 --> 00:09:20.017
Still unpacking?

00:09:20.518 --> 00:09:22.562
Yeah. Just a bit.

00:09:23.771 --> 00:09:26.274
Drinking wasn't the plan,
but they just showed up.

00:09:26.357 --> 00:09:27.692
Sleep and finish tomorrow.

00:09:27.775 --> 00:09:29.318
I will. Are you going to bed?

00:09:30.111 --> 00:09:31.612
-Yeah.
-Good night.

00:09:31.696 --> 00:09:32.530
You too.

00:09:33.489 --> 00:09:35.032
Feel free to let me know.

00:09:36.742 --> 00:09:38.494
You know, before he enlists…

00:09:40.454 --> 00:09:42.456
I told you it's not like that.

00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:44.375
Just tell me if you need to.

00:09:46.919 --> 00:09:48.170
Instead of that,

00:09:49.547 --> 00:09:51.424
let's get our stories straight.

00:09:52.258 --> 00:09:55.761
-Stories?
-We're going on a trip in two days.

00:09:55.845 --> 00:09:57.513
I'm worried Mom might find out.

00:09:57.597 --> 00:09:59.265
This trip is with you, okay?

00:10:00.224 --> 00:10:01.309
Where are you going?

00:10:02.935 --> 00:10:05.896
Gapyeong. Just for one night,
so we can't go anywhere far.

00:10:06.939 --> 00:10:07.773
I got you.

00:10:08.733 --> 00:10:09.567
Thanks.

00:10:41.265 --> 00:10:42.642
What's this?

00:10:42.725 --> 00:10:43.559
Get in.

00:10:43.643 --> 00:10:45.853
Are we taking this car? Look at this.

00:10:47.271 --> 00:10:48.356
It's my dad's.

00:10:49.273 --> 00:10:51.692
I've never seen you drive before.

00:10:51.776 --> 00:10:53.778
Get in. We'll give you a ride to school.

00:10:53.861 --> 00:10:56.197
I'm good. Go have fun. You too.

00:10:56.697 --> 00:10:57.740
I'll drive you.

00:10:57.823 --> 00:10:58.741
No, thanks.

00:11:06.957 --> 00:11:07.958
Seonbae.

00:11:09.377 --> 00:11:12.296
You look so cool driving.

00:11:13.089 --> 00:11:13.923
Really?

00:11:14.924 --> 00:11:19.011
You're all silent and serious.
What are you thinking about?

00:11:19.095 --> 00:11:20.054
Dirty thoughts.

00:11:22.515 --> 00:11:25.893
Dirty thoughts? As if!
I bet you're too focused on driving.

00:11:25.976 --> 00:11:28.729
When I'm with you,
my mind's always in the gutter.

00:11:28.813 --> 00:11:29.980
That reminds me.

00:11:30.064 --> 00:11:33.150
Sang-yeon told me to let her know
if we want the house to ourselves.

00:11:33.234 --> 00:11:38.572
Wow, however did she come up with
such a great idea?

00:11:40.074 --> 00:11:44.203
I would gladly leave the house for her
every single day if she were dating.

00:11:44.286 --> 00:11:46.539
-She doesn't want to date?
-It's not that.

00:11:46.622 --> 00:11:50.960
She mentioned having a crush on someone
who she met online back in Gangneung.

00:11:51.043 --> 00:11:51.877
Online?

00:11:51.961 --> 00:11:56.257
It's unlike her, isn't it?
She said the feelings weren't mutual.

00:11:56.924 --> 00:12:00.344
Have you ever met someone
in an online chat room?

00:12:00.428 --> 00:12:01.262
You think?

00:12:01.762 --> 00:12:02.722
I thought not.

00:12:29.415 --> 00:12:31.041
-Give me a hand.
-Here.

00:12:31.125 --> 00:12:32.251
Wait.

00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:41.594
-Hey!
-Let's go!

00:12:41.677 --> 00:12:42.678
Are you ready?

00:12:42.762 --> 00:12:46.140
You fall, you lose, okay?
Don't get too hung up on winning.

00:12:46.223 --> 00:12:49.810
I used to deliver milk.
I can even ride hands-free.

00:12:49.894 --> 00:12:51.729
And the loser has to grant a wish.

00:12:51.812 --> 00:12:54.023
Jeez, you sure talk a lot.

00:12:54.106 --> 00:12:55.024
Ready, go!

00:12:55.608 --> 00:12:57.318
Hey, you cheater!

00:13:26.305 --> 00:13:27.681
Did you want to win that bad?

00:13:27.765 --> 00:13:29.517
Of course. The prize was a wish.

00:13:30.017 --> 00:13:31.268
So what's your wish?

00:13:31.852 --> 00:13:33.187
Brace yourself.

00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:40.611
Go on, then. I'll grant you any wish.

00:13:45.991 --> 00:13:47.535
When I get discharged…

00:13:50.079 --> 00:13:51.455
let's come back here.

00:13:51.539 --> 00:13:53.833
What? That's your wish?

00:13:54.834 --> 00:13:55.709
Yes.

00:13:59.463 --> 00:14:02.883
What, you think I can't wait
two years for you?

00:14:03.384 --> 00:14:05.553
I never imagined I'd feel this way,

00:14:06.262 --> 00:14:10.099
but enlisting certainly sends you
on an emotional roller coaster.

00:14:12.059 --> 00:14:13.227
You're so silly.

00:14:16.272 --> 00:14:17.690
I like you so much.

00:14:46.677 --> 00:14:50.347
-I need to go in now.
-Don't skip your meals.

00:14:53.684 --> 00:14:55.185
-Take care, okay?
-Okay.

00:14:55.769 --> 00:14:56.812
I'll be in touch.

00:15:01.317 --> 00:15:03.444
Thanks for coming.
Take care on your way back.

00:15:03.527 --> 00:15:04.987
-Yes, sir!
-Call when you're on leave.

00:15:09.158 --> 00:15:10.284
I'll go now.

00:15:11.410 --> 00:15:13.329
-Father, I'm going in!
-I'm off.

00:15:14.204 --> 00:15:15.080
You got this!

00:15:16.081 --> 00:15:17.750
-Write to us!
-Goodbye!

00:15:18.250 --> 00:15:19.084
See you.

00:15:20.961 --> 00:15:22.338
-I'm going in.
-See you.

00:15:22.421 --> 00:15:24.006
-Bye.
-I'm off.

00:15:53.243 --> 00:15:56.288
FROM PRIVATE KIM SANG-HAK
TO RYU EUN-JUNG

00:15:57.373 --> 00:16:02.336
3 MONTHS LATER

00:16:02.419 --> 00:16:03.295
Hey.

00:16:09.551 --> 00:16:12.888
You have a letter from Sang-hak.
It's here with the electricity bill.

00:16:13.389 --> 00:16:14.223
A letter?

00:16:42.584 --> 00:16:43.752
Hello, Ms. Yoon.

00:16:45.379 --> 00:16:46.964
Sang-yeon?

00:16:47.047 --> 00:16:50.676
She stepped outside for a moment
but must have left her phone.

00:16:51.719 --> 00:16:54.304
I'll tell her to call you
as soon as she gets back.

00:16:55.389 --> 00:16:56.390
Yes.

00:16:59.268 --> 00:17:02.312
Of course. You too, Ms. Yoon.

00:17:03.647 --> 00:17:04.523
Goodbye, then.

00:17:13.741 --> 00:17:16.744
You heard that, right? Give her a call.

00:17:23.208 --> 00:17:24.043
Okay?

00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:27.171
I'm going to cook ramyeon. Want some?

00:17:37.723 --> 00:17:41.101
Can't you just answer her calls?

00:17:48.484 --> 00:17:51.904
Okay, I'm sorry.
I'll tell her to stop calling you.

00:17:51.987 --> 00:17:53.739
That's not my point.

00:18:01.205 --> 00:18:03.791
Stop calling Eun-jung
whenever you can't reach me.

00:18:04.291 --> 00:18:05.751
She says it's annoying.

00:18:08.212 --> 00:18:09.505
Whatever. Talk later.

00:18:12.299 --> 00:18:13.300
Why did you do that?

00:18:17.554 --> 00:18:20.641
You know I didn't say that
because I'm annoyed by her calls.

00:18:20.724 --> 00:18:21.558
Then?

00:18:30.818 --> 00:18:34.780
Is it that hard for you
to simply answer her calls?

00:18:39.201 --> 00:18:40.661
What are you getting at?

00:18:50.504 --> 00:18:54.174
You are all she has.

00:18:59.888 --> 00:19:01.265
How ridiculous.

00:19:03.725 --> 00:19:04.643
Hey.

00:19:07.104 --> 00:19:09.731
You think every mother-daughter
relationship out there

00:19:10.232 --> 00:19:12.818
is like the one
you have with your mom, don't you?

00:19:14.695 --> 00:19:17.656
My mom and I were never meant to be
mother and daughter.

00:19:19.199 --> 00:19:20.409
Don't say that.

00:19:20.492 --> 00:19:21.827
She said it herself.

00:19:24.204 --> 00:19:26.206
I won't ask you to believe me.

00:19:26.874 --> 00:19:32.171
Just don't tell me what to do
when you don't know anything.

00:19:40.679 --> 00:19:43.348
What would you even know?

00:19:44.641 --> 00:19:47.019
What do you actually know?

00:19:52.149 --> 00:19:53.734
I hear most moms…

00:19:56.278 --> 00:19:57.821
when they lose a child,

00:19:59.489 --> 00:20:02.367
try to carry on
for the sake of their other children.

00:20:02.993 --> 00:20:05.037
But not my mom.

00:20:07.164 --> 00:20:08.790
My mom, she…

00:20:15.130 --> 00:20:16.757
You could never understand.

00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:37.236
Sang-yeon and I didn't exchange
a single word for the next three days.

00:20:39.863 --> 00:20:42.824
It was thanks to Sang-yeon
that I could finally bring myself

00:20:43.450 --> 00:20:44.993
to develop that film roll.

00:20:46.536 --> 00:20:48.997
My mind was all jumbled because of her,

00:20:50.457 --> 00:20:52.542
and I drew strength from the anger.

00:20:57.381 --> 00:21:02.302
The first photo was of a quote
from some book.

00:21:10.852 --> 00:21:13.146
Then a frame that he had hung in his room.

00:21:14.523 --> 00:21:16.191
A photo of Laika the dog.

00:21:18.193 --> 00:21:19.569
Some VHS tapes.

00:21:21.530 --> 00:21:25.033
The sticker I had placed.

00:21:32.833 --> 00:21:38.463
He looked more peaceful
than I had always imagined.

00:22:03.613 --> 00:22:04.656
What is this?

00:22:09.578 --> 00:22:12.122
Photos that Sang-hak oppa took.

00:22:17.586 --> 00:22:19.087
Not Sang-hak seonbae…

00:22:22.799 --> 00:22:24.134
but your brother.

00:22:35.187 --> 00:22:36.063
My brother?

00:22:41.401 --> 00:22:44.738
I've actually had a film roll of his.

00:22:46.365 --> 00:22:48.075
I joined the photography club

00:22:49.117 --> 00:22:51.119
because I wanted to develop these.

00:22:52.954 --> 00:22:54.915
Seeing her sitting there, trembling,

00:22:56.249 --> 00:22:58.043
made the three days of silence

00:22:59.252 --> 00:23:00.545
and our argument…

00:23:04.383 --> 00:23:06.176
feel utterly pointless.

00:23:43.547 --> 00:23:50.178
YOU'RE SO LUCKY

00:24:29.801 --> 00:24:32.429
DO NOT ENTER
SANG-YEON'S ROOM

00:25:47.546 --> 00:25:50.882
I had no clue back then…

00:25:52.884 --> 00:25:56.388
just how deeply those photos affected her.

00:26:28.503 --> 00:26:29.921
It's her, isn't it?

00:26:37.012 --> 00:26:38.555
The woman that he loved.

00:26:47.814 --> 00:26:49.357
Why did he die?

00:26:58.908 --> 00:27:00.452
I know that it's my fault.

00:27:01.161 --> 00:27:02.120
What?

00:27:02.203 --> 00:27:04.623
You also think that he died because of me.

00:27:05.123 --> 00:27:06.708
Can't you just let them date?

00:27:07.834 --> 00:27:08.710
What?

00:27:10.462 --> 00:27:13.340
Look. He'll never get over her.

00:27:14.674 --> 00:27:17.636
If you keep doing this,
he might really leave home.

00:27:20.555 --> 00:27:23.516
Do you mean to say
that he died because of me?

00:27:24.476 --> 00:27:26.394
How is that because of me?

00:27:27.062 --> 00:27:31.816
It's because of you.
You said yourself that you killed him.

00:27:32.817 --> 00:27:36.946
If you hadn't gotten involved,
then he wouldn't have died!

00:27:40.533 --> 00:27:42.994
I wouldn't have known
if it weren't for Sang-yeon.

00:27:43.495 --> 00:27:45.997
Every single diary entry is about it.

00:27:46.498 --> 00:27:47.749
I couldn't…

00:27:49.459 --> 00:27:53.129
I couldn't sit back and do nothing.

00:27:54.589 --> 00:27:57.550
I only showed you the diary
because I was curious.

00:27:59.302 --> 00:28:01.930
Your grown son had found someone he loved,

00:28:03.056 --> 00:28:06.434
and I couldn't understand
why you were making such a fuss.

00:28:07.852 --> 00:28:08.853
But then…

00:28:11.481 --> 00:28:12.774
a week later…

00:28:16.069 --> 00:28:18.655
He died one week later.

00:28:21.533 --> 00:28:23.076
He died because of me.

00:28:23.159 --> 00:28:27.330
No. Sang-yeon, it's not like that.

00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:31.668
I didn't know you felt that way.
It's simply not true--

00:28:31.751 --> 00:28:34.212
Then tell me!

00:28:35.463 --> 00:28:37.298
Tell me what the truth is!

00:28:39.008 --> 00:28:42.804
"Your brother died
because of these other reasons,

00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:45.598
so it's not your fault."

00:28:46.099 --> 00:28:48.643
You need to tell me
so I can live with myself!

00:28:51.855 --> 00:28:54.858
It wasn't your fault. It was my fault.

00:28:59.279 --> 00:29:00.780
I'll know once I ask her.

00:29:02.031 --> 00:29:03.491
I'm going to find this woman,

00:29:04.993 --> 00:29:06.494
and I'm going to ask her.

00:29:11.291 --> 00:29:13.001
Do you think I can't?

00:29:18.715 --> 00:29:21.134
I know someone who knows him very well.

00:29:23.678 --> 00:29:24.512
Who…

00:29:26.264 --> 00:29:28.141
who knew my Sang-hak that well?

00:29:51.122 --> 00:29:52.165
Hi, seonbae.

00:29:56.961 --> 00:29:57.921
Are you on leave?

00:29:58.004 --> 00:29:59.839
Yeah, my first military leave.

00:30:02.175 --> 00:30:03.551
Done for today?

00:30:05.637 --> 00:30:07.388
Yes, I'm done for today.

00:30:07.472 --> 00:30:09.307
Good, because I was getting bored.

00:30:09.390 --> 00:30:10.475
What about Eun-jung?

00:30:10.558 --> 00:30:14.229
Tutoring. She'll be here in an hour or so.
Let's hang out and eat together, then.

00:30:16.523 --> 00:30:18.817
Sure. But what should we do?

00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:22.403
We could go to a café.
Or I was thinking about taking a walk.

00:30:22.987 --> 00:30:24.155
-A walk?
-Yeah.

00:30:24.656 --> 00:30:26.157
-Where?
-Up that mountain.

00:30:30.537 --> 00:30:32.914
I don't really like mountains.

00:30:35.083 --> 00:30:37.293
-Should we just go to a café?
-Sure.

00:30:45.218 --> 00:30:46.886
Why do you look so down today?

00:30:47.387 --> 00:30:48.763
-I do?
-Yeah.

00:30:50.932 --> 00:30:52.141
Is it that obvious?

00:30:53.184 --> 00:30:55.353
I thought I had a solid poker face.

00:30:56.187 --> 00:30:59.774
What's got you feeling down?
Don't say it’s for no reason.

00:31:02.110 --> 00:31:05.363
How did you know
I was just about to say that?

00:31:05.864 --> 00:31:06.698
Well?

00:31:12.287 --> 00:31:13.371
No reason, really.

00:31:16.207 --> 00:31:17.125
How about this?

00:31:18.376 --> 00:31:19.335
I just

00:31:21.170 --> 00:31:22.797
felt like hating Mom today.

00:31:25.675 --> 00:31:26.885
Let's leave it at that.

00:31:33.099 --> 00:31:34.559
Shall we go for that walk?

00:31:35.852 --> 00:31:37.729
Would you like that? All right, then.

00:31:38.229 --> 00:31:42.275
Cafés can be stuffy, so a walk is great.
Let’s grab something to drink first.

00:31:51.117 --> 00:31:51.951
But

00:31:53.202 --> 00:31:55.038
why the sudden change of heart?

00:32:03.546 --> 00:32:04.505
What would you like?

00:32:09.886 --> 00:32:11.262
My brother

00:32:12.597 --> 00:32:13.640
is dead.

00:32:27.862 --> 00:32:28.696
I know.

00:32:33.660 --> 00:32:35.453
I happened to figure it out,

00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:38.581
and Eun-jung told me later.

00:32:42.168 --> 00:32:46.714
I'm happy… that you told me yourself.

00:32:51.928 --> 00:32:54.305
Could I have a milk tea, please?

00:32:54.973 --> 00:32:55.890
Yeah, sure.

00:32:58.935 --> 00:33:00.061
All right.

00:33:01.854 --> 00:33:03.314
She just got off the subway.

00:33:04.565 --> 00:33:07.694
-We'd better hurry, then.
-We'll go slowly but surely.

00:33:19.330 --> 00:33:20.707
How have you been?

00:33:33.553 --> 00:33:37.015
I'm telling you,
the air is fresher on the outside.

00:33:38.141 --> 00:33:38.975
He's so silly.

00:33:40.059 --> 00:33:40.893
Listen.

00:33:41.602 --> 00:33:42.895
-Here's my list.
-Okay.

00:33:43.479 --> 00:33:45.690
McDonald's, pork belly, chicken with beer,

00:33:45.773 --> 00:33:48.609
pizza, jjatang.
That's black bean noodles and fried pork.

00:33:48.693 --> 00:33:50.278
Ramyeon, Choco Pie, and Coke.

00:33:50.361 --> 00:33:51.654
McDonald's comes first?

00:33:51.738 --> 00:33:55.408
Yeah. And it has to be a Big Mac with
two patties and three pieces of bread.

00:33:57.326 --> 00:33:59.996
Hold up, I already had Choco Pie and Coke.

00:34:00.496 --> 00:34:03.082
I ate five in one sitting earlier.

00:34:03.166 --> 00:34:04.167
Five?

00:34:15.762 --> 00:34:16.763
Sang-yeon!

00:34:18.222 --> 00:34:19.307
Cheon Sang-yeon!

00:34:27.273 --> 00:34:28.816
I only found out later…

00:34:32.862 --> 00:34:34.238
what Sang-hak seonbae…

00:34:36.616 --> 00:34:38.659
truly meant to Sang-yeon.

00:34:59.222 --> 00:35:01.641
It's on the third floor.
I'll see how it looks.

00:35:01.724 --> 00:35:02.558
Sure.

00:35:03.976 --> 00:35:10.983
FALL OF 1998

00:35:54.485 --> 00:35:57.280
After quitting school
and moving to Gangneung,

00:35:58.072 --> 00:36:01.159
Sang-yeon refused to do anything
for a long time.

00:36:02.118 --> 00:36:08.040
She never went out,
met people, or spoke to anyone.

00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:15.965
The only thing that Sang-yeon did…

00:36:21.012 --> 00:36:23.347
was search for four-digit numbers.

00:36:23.431 --> 00:36:25.016
GANGWON 81D 2578

00:36:28.895 --> 00:36:30.730
Two, five, seven, eight…

00:36:38.112 --> 00:36:39.363
INCORRECT PASSWORD

00:36:40.198 --> 00:36:45.119
Sang-yeon had once asked her brother
about creating passwords,

00:36:45.203 --> 00:36:46.162
and he had replied…

00:36:46.245 --> 00:36:47.163
I don't know.

00:36:47.663 --> 00:36:52.376
I guess you could use a combination
of four digits and some letters.

00:36:54.503 --> 00:36:59.884
She had long forgotten why she was even
trying to log in to his account.

00:36:59.967 --> 00:37:04.013
Like any other day, she was trying
different combinations when…

00:37:26.285 --> 00:37:28.788
Laika 1957.

00:37:47.556 --> 00:37:48.391
INCORRECT PASSWORD

00:37:53.604 --> 00:37:54.522
INCORRECT PASSWORD

00:38:31.267 --> 00:38:37.898
MESSAGE INBOX

00:38:38.899 --> 00:38:39.734
INBOX

00:38:39.817 --> 00:38:41.819
Why is it so cold in October?

00:38:44.196 --> 00:38:47.867
I asked to delay printing the pamphlets,
but everyone says they can't wait.

00:38:48.367 --> 00:38:50.786
At this point,
no one believes you'll return.

00:38:52.913 --> 00:38:55.082
Even if you show up,
I won't return your tapes.

00:38:57.126 --> 00:39:01.380
I'm not sure whether I'm messaging you
out of habit or stubbornness anymore.

00:39:01.964 --> 00:39:06.469
My teacher says I might not get in
to university. Isn't that worth a reply?

00:39:08.387 --> 00:39:11.349
Moonee? Is it really you? Hey, I--

00:39:43.214 --> 00:39:45.925
How could you disappear like that?

00:39:46.008 --> 00:39:49.428
Nobody believes me
that you appeared online.

00:39:50.930 --> 00:39:54.266
We're having an impromptu meetup
tomorrow at 7:00 p.m. Please come.

00:39:54.767 --> 00:39:58.354
You know Jang's Gamjatang, right?
Across the street from Cine Core.

00:40:02.108 --> 00:40:08.572
CINE CORE

00:40:22.086 --> 00:40:22.920
Come on in.

00:40:26.382 --> 00:40:30.511
-Aren't you going to drink something?
-So is he coming or not?

00:40:31.011 --> 00:40:32.513
Let's give him some time.

00:40:33.180 --> 00:40:35.558
Are you sure he was online?

00:40:35.641 --> 00:40:39.895
I'm positive. I messaged him about
our meetup, and he definitely read it.

00:40:41.897 --> 00:40:43.107
What would you like?

00:40:46.235 --> 00:40:47.945
Pork neck bone soup, please.

00:40:48.612 --> 00:40:52.366
Either way, it's a relief. I was worried
something had happened to him.

00:40:53.242 --> 00:40:55.286
So let's just wait one more week.

00:40:55.369 --> 00:40:57.788
It's not like printing pamphlets
takes long.

00:40:57.872 --> 00:41:02.126
Why should we wait for him?
It's not like he was anything special.

00:41:03.043 --> 00:41:05.921
He was to Uncle Tat.
You know he respected Moonee.

00:41:06.005 --> 00:41:07.298
And what about us?

00:41:07.381 --> 00:41:12.136
Moonee needs to come back for his sake.
Don't you need to study for your exams?

00:41:13.220 --> 00:41:17.391
I don't get it. He promised he'd come.

00:41:17.892 --> 00:41:21.604
He's just some jerk
who let his art go to his head and quit.

00:41:22.521 --> 00:41:25.232
Stop making a big fuss.
It's no big deal, okay?

00:41:26.025 --> 00:41:27.151
Are you done talking?

00:41:30.321 --> 00:41:32.239
Not yet. I haven't even begun.

00:41:32.948 --> 00:41:36.035
I wasn't going to say this,

00:41:36.118 --> 00:41:38.204
but do you know why
Dylan's been MIA lately?

00:41:38.287 --> 00:41:40.539
What does that have to do with Moonee?

00:41:40.623 --> 00:41:45.294
-Wait, hey--
-It's because Moonee hit on Dylan.

00:41:45.377 --> 00:41:47.421
He acted innocent
but was a two-faced sneak.

00:41:47.505 --> 00:41:49.340
Bullshit! Watch your damn mouth!

00:41:49.423 --> 00:41:51.300
Watch your mouth, you little prick.

00:41:51.383 --> 00:41:53.719
-Cut it out. Sorry, ma'am.
-What is this?

00:41:53.802 --> 00:41:56.180
You can dish it out but can't take it?

00:41:56.263 --> 00:41:59.558
Just because you hit on everyone
doesn't mean we all do.

00:42:00.643 --> 00:42:02.019
Come on, guys!

00:42:03.020 --> 00:42:04.188
Cut it out.

00:42:05.397 --> 00:42:06.273
Are you okay?

00:42:15.241 --> 00:42:17.409
Don't run your mouth
when you know nothing.

00:42:17.493 --> 00:42:20.538
Moonee doesn't deserve to be
talked about like that.

00:42:20.621 --> 00:42:21.747
Tat, wait.

00:42:21.830 --> 00:42:23.666
-That little bastard.
-Drop it.

00:42:23.749 --> 00:42:24.833
Hey!

00:42:25.334 --> 00:42:27.419
-What's wrong with you kids?
-Sit down.

00:42:27.503 --> 00:42:29.088
He was being a prick!

00:42:29.171 --> 00:42:30.381
We're sorry, ma'am.

00:42:31.882 --> 00:42:32.925
Hey, cool it.

00:42:57.241 --> 00:42:59.159
Do you know
what people are saying about you?

00:42:59.660 --> 00:43:02.454
That you're some art-obsessed nobody
trying to act relevant

00:43:02.538 --> 00:43:05.207
and that Dylan quit
because you did her dirty.

00:43:05.833 --> 00:43:07.501
Do you know what I think?

00:43:08.002 --> 00:43:09.670
I agree with them.

00:43:09.753 --> 00:43:13.757
You're a real coward,
and I won't be writing shit to you again.

00:43:14.717 --> 00:43:16.260
This is my last message.

00:43:29.773 --> 00:43:32.026
Thank you for…

00:43:34.445 --> 00:43:35.738
fighting…

00:43:40.868 --> 00:43:41.869
for me.

00:44:06.727 --> 00:44:08.270
Hi, Uncle Tat.

00:44:10.606 --> 00:44:12.524
I am doing well.

00:44:13.901 --> 00:44:17.488
We can't meet right now, but…

00:44:20.532 --> 00:44:21.533
I'm…

00:44:27.331 --> 00:44:28.332
doing…

00:44:33.837 --> 00:44:34.838
really…

00:45:53.375 --> 00:45:55.169
From that moment on,

00:45:56.044 --> 00:46:00.674
Sang-yeon decided to believe
that her brother was alive somewhere.

00:46:06.096 --> 00:46:08.390

NICKNAME: SOMEWHERE

00:46:08.474 --> 00:46:09.516

00:46:13.479 --> 00:46:16.565
SEARCH: UNCLETAT

00:46:27.910 --> 00:46:29.703
Order number three,
your shrimp burger meal…

00:46:37.544 --> 00:46:38.837
Hello.

00:46:39.463 --> 00:46:40.589
Introduce yourself now.

00:46:40.672 --> 00:46:42.508
I'm a high schooler in Ilyeong.

00:46:43.550 --> 00:46:44.885
I'm in high school too.

00:46:45.469 --> 00:46:47.888
-Who's finished developing?
-I need another round.

00:46:47.971 --> 00:46:49.807
How many rounds has it been already?

00:46:51.767 --> 00:46:54.978
Everyone's busy preparing
for the exhibition. Excuse them.

00:46:58.190 --> 00:47:00.609
I'm fine. It's fun just to watch.

00:47:01.860 --> 00:47:02.736
Well, enjoy.

00:47:05.113 --> 00:47:08.617
Is it okay that I don't know much
about photography?

00:47:08.700 --> 00:47:10.410
It's my first time joining a club.

00:47:11.912 --> 00:47:13.956
UNCLETAT HAS LEFT THE CHAT

00:47:17.459 --> 00:47:19.503
UNCLETAT INVITED YOU TO A PRIVATE CHAT

00:47:29.096 --> 00:47:30.097
Welcome.

00:47:39.398 --> 00:47:41.066
May I take your order?

00:47:41.149 --> 00:47:43.610
For drinks, we have Coke and Sprite.

00:47:44.862 --> 00:47:46.488
Did you watch the Soonpoong rerun?

00:47:48.657 --> 00:47:50.659
I've never watched it. Is it good?

00:47:52.494 --> 00:47:54.788
No way. You've never watched
Soonpoong Clinic?

00:47:54.872 --> 00:47:56.164
Are you even Korean?

00:47:58.250 --> 00:47:59.084
Sorry?

00:47:59.877 --> 00:48:01.086
No, I'm good.

00:48:04.923 --> 00:48:07.843
I think I should give up
on this year's entrance exams.

00:48:10.470 --> 00:48:13.849
Are your grades that bad?
Are you an airhead?

00:48:13.932 --> 00:48:17.185
No way. I was just going through a phase.
I'm actually hella smart.

00:48:17.269 --> 00:48:18.478
A phase?

00:48:23.609 --> 00:48:25.986
There was something more important
than studying.

00:48:44.504 --> 00:48:47.299
OFFLINE USERS
UNCLETAT

00:49:16.036 --> 00:49:18.538
Let's do this!
I'm officially retaking the exam!

00:49:30.759 --> 00:49:33.261
Perhaps he was busy
studying for the entrance exam.

00:49:33.804 --> 00:49:37.891
There was no news from Uncle Tat
for a very long time.

00:49:46.525 --> 00:49:47.818
Then, one day…

00:50:15.971 --> 00:50:17.764
Guys, I'm back!

00:50:42.039 --> 00:50:44.416
-Hello.
-Hello.

00:51:19.618 --> 00:51:21.703
-Hey!
-Uncle Tat!

00:51:22.579 --> 00:51:24.331
-Hey, bro.
-I heard you got in.

00:51:24.414 --> 00:51:26.166
Yeongang University, was it? What major?

00:51:26.249 --> 00:51:29.377
-Business management.
-Whoa, Kim Sang-hak.

00:51:29.461 --> 00:51:31.129
Since when were you smart?

00:51:31.213 --> 00:51:32.297
I've always been smart.

00:51:32.881 --> 00:51:34.508
-Let's take a photo.
-Sure.

00:51:59.658 --> 00:52:00.617
Kim…

00:52:02.661 --> 00:52:03.954
Sang-hak.

00:52:04.871 --> 00:52:09.626
That's when Sang-yeon decided
that she'd go to university.

00:52:11.086 --> 00:52:15.173
It's nice to meet you.
We met at the booth.

00:52:15.257 --> 00:52:16.883
I'm Kim Sang-hak, a business major.

00:52:16.967 --> 00:52:17.801
I know.

00:52:18.301 --> 00:52:20.929
I'm Cheon Sang-yeon.
Engineering. Class of 2002.

00:52:21.012 --> 00:52:24.349
Come on, put him in his place.
Your boyfriend's getting cocky again.

00:52:25.350 --> 00:52:27.310
These two are dating, by the way.

00:52:28.395 --> 00:52:31.606
Wow, really? You guys look good together.

00:52:31.690 --> 00:52:33.024
-Do we?
-Yeah.

00:52:33.108 --> 00:52:34.067
That hurt my pride.

00:52:34.151 --> 00:52:36.319
Honestly, you're not that handsome.

00:52:39.739 --> 00:52:43.285
Sang-yeon said it had felt unfair.

00:53:04.890 --> 00:53:05.974
Hi, seonbae.

00:53:14.107 --> 00:53:18.111
It's been a while since I've smelled this.
The scent of mountains.

00:53:18.737 --> 00:53:19.738
It's nice.

00:53:32.459 --> 00:53:33.585
Sang-yeon.

00:53:36.963 --> 00:53:38.131
I can't

00:53:39.716 --> 00:53:41.801
possibly know exactly how you feel,

00:53:42.552 --> 00:53:47.015
but I feel like I understand
to some extent, even if just a little.

00:53:49.601 --> 00:53:51.811
I'm talking about
being the one left behind.

00:53:53.521 --> 00:53:57.275
There was this guy
I was good friends with in the past.

00:53:59.110 --> 00:54:00.737
One day, he just vanished.

00:54:03.406 --> 00:54:05.825
You can never quite come to terms with it

00:54:06.910 --> 00:54:08.995
because you will never know why.

00:54:11.289 --> 00:54:12.290
I see.

00:54:15.418 --> 00:54:16.836
Were you two very close?

00:54:18.463 --> 00:54:19.464
Yes, we were.

00:54:20.173 --> 00:54:22.384
Well, I can't speak for him,

00:54:23.468 --> 00:54:26.721
but I really liked him as a person.

00:54:34.437 --> 00:54:35.313
Do you want this?

00:54:36.648 --> 00:54:37.482
What?

00:54:41.611 --> 00:54:42.529
A watch?

00:54:44.030 --> 00:54:46.825
It was a freebie,
but black isn't really my color.

00:54:46.908 --> 00:54:51.037
Wow, I was looking to buy one
exactly like this.

00:54:51.997 --> 00:54:55.000
It's a really cheap model,
probably because it was a freebie.

00:54:55.083 --> 00:54:56.459
That doesn't matter.

00:54:57.043 --> 00:55:00.088
Thanks, seriously.
I needed a watch just like this.

00:55:01.965 --> 00:55:04.050
I'm glad it's something you needed.

00:55:05.802 --> 00:55:07.429
Sang-yeon realized that day

00:55:08.763 --> 00:55:11.224
that she had been in love with him
for a long time

00:55:12.392 --> 00:55:14.811
and that she could no longer…

00:55:17.814 --> 00:55:18.982
hide her feelings.

00:55:32.245 --> 00:55:33.163
Sang-yeon.

00:55:36.041 --> 00:55:37.125
Cheon Sang-yeon!

00:55:40.795 --> 00:55:44.466
Maybe something's up.
I've never seen her act like that.

00:55:45.550 --> 00:55:47.177
Maybe you should head home.

00:55:50.305 --> 00:55:51.848
Please enjoy.

00:55:54.809 --> 00:55:57.395
It's okay. I'll go check on her later.

00:55:59.647 --> 00:56:01.066
This looks good.

00:56:09.074 --> 00:56:10.784
-Did you get a new watch?
-Yeah.

00:56:10.867 --> 00:56:12.243
Sang-yeon gave it to me.

00:56:12.744 --> 00:56:15.330
She got it as a freebie
but didn't like the color.

00:56:19.250 --> 00:56:20.210
A mountain?

00:56:20.293 --> 00:56:22.796
Yeah, the one behind campus. Why?

00:56:27.634 --> 00:56:28.510
It's nothing.

00:56:30.303 --> 00:56:31.805
I'm glad.

00:56:32.764 --> 00:56:33.765
Glad about what?

00:56:36.351 --> 00:56:40.855
Sang-yeon used to be
really afraid of mountains.

00:56:41.940 --> 00:56:44.067
Her brother was found on a mountain.

00:56:46.861 --> 00:56:47.904
I see.

00:56:48.738 --> 00:56:52.242
I also had a place
that I avoided for a long time.

00:56:53.201 --> 00:56:54.786
Dajeong Supermarket.

00:56:55.995 --> 00:56:59.374
Sang-hak oppa walked me home once,

00:56:59.457 --> 00:57:01.876
and we had walked past there.

00:57:02.502 --> 00:57:04.379
I couldn't go there for over a year.

00:57:06.506 --> 00:57:08.716
I'm sure Sang-yeon
had it much worse than me.

00:57:09.384 --> 00:57:12.512
She probably has countless places
that haunt her like that.

00:57:14.013 --> 00:57:15.682
Sang-yeon told me today

00:57:16.683 --> 00:57:18.017
that her brother died.

00:57:20.478 --> 00:57:21.813
She did?

00:57:21.896 --> 00:57:22.981
Yeah.

00:57:27.152 --> 00:57:30.280
I think it might be a first for her…

00:57:32.198 --> 00:57:36.327
opening up to someone about that.

00:57:36.870 --> 00:57:40.039
It was probably because I suggested
going up the mountain.

00:57:45.545 --> 00:57:50.633
Still, I think it’s great that she got to
share that with someone at all.

00:57:53.761 --> 00:57:57.348
But I can't help but feel a little hurt.

00:57:59.934 --> 00:58:03.605
I've been patiently waiting for her
to open up to me.

00:58:04.856 --> 00:58:09.068
Knowing how painful it must have been,
it's not something I can just bring up.

00:58:11.988 --> 00:58:13.615
Maybe it's like this.

00:58:14.908 --> 00:58:19.204
I know nothing, so maybe she felt
more comfortable talking to me about it.

00:58:19.913 --> 00:58:21.539
Things are different with you.

00:58:22.832 --> 00:58:26.753
Perhaps that’s why it's harder for her
to open up to you about it.

00:58:28.129 --> 00:58:31.382
Still, I want her to be honest with me.

00:58:32.425 --> 00:58:35.929
I want her to tell me
if she's in pain or feeling sad.

00:58:40.225 --> 00:58:41.351
Maybe someday, right?

00:58:41.434 --> 00:58:43.061
Of course.

00:58:46.981 --> 00:58:51.277
By the way, I developed the Tri-X roll.

00:58:51.903 --> 00:58:54.781
Really? Let's see it, then. I'm curious.

00:58:58.368 --> 00:59:01.287
Don't get jealous. He's really handsome.

00:59:08.461 --> 00:59:10.380
Hey, I have this VHS tape too.

00:59:10.964 --> 00:59:13.007
-Really?
-Stephen Chow's A Chinese Odyssey,

00:59:13.091 --> 00:59:14.300
Parts one and two.

00:59:17.095 --> 00:59:20.056
I placed this sticker in his room
when I was in elementary school.

00:59:20.682 --> 00:59:23.476
I didn't even know
this was Sang-yeon's place.

00:59:23.560 --> 00:59:24.435
-Really?
-Yeah.

00:59:26.729 --> 00:59:28.982
That's Sang-yeon. Adorable, isn't she?

01:00:13.818 --> 01:00:14.777
This person…

01:00:20.450 --> 01:00:21.868
is Sang-yeon's brother?

01:00:25.246 --> 01:00:26.080
Yeah.

01:00:28.333 --> 01:00:29.167
Why?

01:00:33.463 --> 01:00:34.631
I know him.

01:00:48.227 --> 01:00:50.980
Sir, wait! I'd like to get off.

01:01:22.178 --> 01:01:24.222
Did something happen?

01:01:26.099 --> 01:01:27.892
You've never called this late.

01:01:33.106 --> 01:01:35.775
Is this about how I left earlier?

01:01:36.359 --> 01:01:37.985
I saw a photo of your brother.

01:01:42.782 --> 01:01:43.908
It was you, wasn't it?

01:01:46.953 --> 01:01:48.121
You're the one…

01:01:50.289 --> 01:01:51.958
who replied to me as Moonee.

01:05:34.263 --> 01:05:39.268
