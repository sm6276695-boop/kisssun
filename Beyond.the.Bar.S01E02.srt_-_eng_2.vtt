BEYOND THE BAR

00:00:43.252 --> 00:00:44.628
{\an8}BEST PAPER AWARD

00:00:46.213 --> 00:00:47.881
{\an8}IVF & IUI
HOSEON FERTILITY CLINIC

00:00:47.965 --> 00:00:49.550
{\an8}FERTILITY COUNSELING ROOM

00:00:49.633 --> 00:00:51.510
{\an8}In 1985, Hoseon Fertility Clinic

00:00:51.593 --> 00:00:55.472
{\an8}achieved the world's first IVF birth

00:00:55.556 --> 00:00:57.766
{\an8}using immature oocytes.

00:00:57.849 --> 00:01:00.269
{\an8}Our fertility preservation clinic,

00:01:00.352 --> 00:01:03.981
{\an8}offering egg, sperm,
and embryo freezing, is world-class.

00:01:04.064 --> 00:01:06.358
{\an8}We hold the largest sperm stock in Korea.

00:01:06.441 --> 00:01:08.944
{\an8}You bunch of scammers!

00:01:14.074 --> 00:01:16.326
You bunch of scammers!

00:01:17.828 --> 00:01:19.746
- What's his deal?
- He sounds crazy.

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:20.872
Give it back.

00:01:21.373 --> 00:01:22.249
Give it back!

00:01:22.874 --> 00:01:25.419
Calm down.
Let's sit down and talk about this.

00:01:25.502 --> 00:01:26.753
You said you're the best.

00:01:27.379 --> 00:01:29.339
You said your stuff was world-class!

00:01:29.423 --> 00:01:32.217
I get how upset you are,
but you can't do this.

00:01:32.301 --> 00:01:33.468
Mr. Park Gi-beom.

00:01:33.552 --> 00:01:36.096
Calm down. Let's just sit down and talk.

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:37.139
Back off.

00:01:48.817 --> 00:01:51.153
Get off me!

00:01:55.824 --> 00:01:57.701
Let go. Give it back!

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.412
I said give it back!

00:02:01.204 --> 00:02:02.956
I want my sperm back!

00:02:12.007 --> 00:02:16.303
HOT WATER IS THE TEST FOR TEA AND LOVE

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.311
Including the damaged medical equipment,

00:02:24.394 --> 00:02:26.521
Hoseon Fertility Clinic
is claiming damages

00:02:26.605 --> 00:02:28.190
of 423 million won.

00:02:29.691 --> 00:02:31.068
Isn't that a little high?

00:02:31.943 --> 00:02:35.489
They say this equipment
is worth over 600 million won.

00:02:37.658 --> 00:02:40.160
Can the client afford to pay it?

00:02:40.243 --> 00:02:41.119
No.

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.165
But the executives are asking us
to pay special attention to this case.

00:02:46.083 --> 00:02:47.417
Why?

00:02:47.501 --> 00:02:49.586
Is the client someone with internal ties?

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:50.921
No.

00:02:51.004 --> 00:02:52.923
Hoseon is on the other side.

00:02:53.006 --> 00:02:55.384
Hoseon used to be
our corporate law team's client,

00:02:55.467 --> 00:02:56.426
but I think

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.346
the team resigned from a case
to uphold legal ethics.

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.432
After that, Hoseon started playing dirty,

00:03:02.516 --> 00:03:04.976
and we lost
all our hospital-related clients.

00:03:05.686 --> 00:03:07.354
Mr. Ko is pretty fired up.

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:11.358
Tell me. Why did the client
cause such a scene?

00:03:12.734 --> 00:03:14.236
I'm still looking into it.

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:15.445
I should meet him.

00:03:15.529 --> 00:03:17.864
He's coming to the office next Wednesday.

00:03:19.783 --> 00:03:21.660
Have two of the newcomers go over it.

00:03:21.743 --> 00:03:24.538
Sure. I'll put Kang Hyo-min
and Ji Guk-hyeon on it.

00:03:26.456 --> 00:03:28.709
One more thing.

00:03:29.584 --> 00:03:31.670
The lawsuit over
the flawed management resolution…

00:03:31.753 --> 00:03:32.879
Yes?

00:03:32.963 --> 00:03:35.632
I assigned it to Na Dong-su,

00:03:35.716 --> 00:03:37.718
but he's stalling,
and it's not the first time.

00:03:37.801 --> 00:03:40.429
Na Dong-su… Is he Hong Do-yun's associate?

00:03:40.512 --> 00:03:41.388
Yes.

00:03:41.471 --> 00:03:42.431
He's in his second year,

00:03:42.514 --> 00:03:44.391
{\an8}but he logs
under five billable hours a month.

00:03:44.474 --> 00:03:45.976
{\an8}BILLABLE HOURS: TIME BILLED TO A CLIENT

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:48.979
{\an8}He sometimes works with our team,
but a two-hour task takes a week,

00:03:49.062 --> 00:03:50.188
and his results are a mess.

00:03:50.272 --> 00:03:52.274
Total salary thief.

00:03:52.357 --> 00:03:54.943
He's the son of
Attorney Hong Do-yun's client.

00:03:58.029 --> 00:04:01.783
Us associates log
over 200 billable hours a month,

00:04:01.867 --> 00:04:05.454
and that salary thief is killing morale.

00:04:05.996 --> 00:04:07.622
Please do something about it.

00:04:07.706 --> 00:04:08.665
I will.

00:04:09.291 --> 00:04:10.625
Thank you.

00:04:13.295 --> 00:04:14.212
I'll get going, then.

00:04:14.296 --> 00:04:15.255
Okay.

00:04:16.006 --> 00:04:17.299
- Bye.
- Bye.

00:04:29.102 --> 00:04:30.103
Mr. Yoon!

00:04:34.566 --> 00:04:36.318
Where's he rushing off to?

00:04:39.237 --> 00:04:40.447
- Sir.
- Yes?

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:42.532
Where's Mr. Yoon rushing off to?

00:04:42.616 --> 00:04:44.785
He gets off work early on Fridays.

00:04:44.868 --> 00:04:46.661
- Why?
- To pick his kid up.

00:04:46.745 --> 00:04:48.997
Mr. Ji, did you finish the UCPA complaint?

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:49.956
A kid?

00:04:57.214 --> 00:04:59.174
Hash!

00:04:59.257 --> 00:05:00.884
Dad's here, Hash!

00:05:01.551 --> 00:05:03.178
Come here.

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:07.474
Let's go. Come on, Hash.

00:05:07.557 --> 00:05:08.850
Let's go!

00:05:27.077 --> 00:05:28.286
Okay, Hash.

00:06:04.698 --> 00:06:06.783
Is it because it's a day off?

00:06:06.867 --> 00:06:08.201
The weather's so nice and warm.

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:18.587
Open it.

00:06:32.058 --> 00:06:33.226
Look.

00:07:03.757 --> 00:07:04.799
I spent two years

00:07:05.884 --> 00:07:07.135
trying to win your heart.

00:07:08.261 --> 00:07:09.971
Thankfully, you opened up to me.

00:07:10.055 --> 00:07:12.140
Now here we are, together.

00:07:13.308 --> 00:07:16.519
This past year with you
has been truly wonderful.

00:07:17.062 --> 00:07:20.106
Ever since I told you how I felt,

00:07:20.732 --> 00:07:22.359
I've said "I love you"

00:07:23.777 --> 00:07:24.945
more times than I can count.

00:07:26.488 --> 00:07:28.031
But I felt hesitant

00:07:28.114 --> 00:07:30.659
thinking about saying those words today.

00:07:31.242 --> 00:07:32.786
I wondered if the words "I love you"

00:07:32.869 --> 00:07:35.664
can truly express
everything I feel for you

00:07:35.747 --> 00:07:37.207
and if there was anything better.

00:07:38.166 --> 00:07:39.209
But in the end,

00:07:40.293 --> 00:07:43.672
nothing conveys my heart
better than those words.

00:07:44.297 --> 00:07:45.173
I love you.

00:07:46.883 --> 00:07:48.385
These three simple words

00:07:48.969 --> 00:07:51.429
are everything I want to say to you.

00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:57.268
Kang Hyo-min, my darling,

00:07:59.521 --> 00:08:00.855
will you marry me?

00:08:06.111 --> 00:08:07.487
What's this all of a sudden?

00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:08.947
It's about time.

00:08:09.572 --> 00:08:11.783
We're at that age, and it's been a year.

00:08:11.866 --> 00:08:13.159
Isn't this what comes next?

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:17.080
I have something to say.

00:08:19.624 --> 00:08:21.167
You're making me nervous.

00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:23.420
What is it?

00:08:29.926 --> 00:08:30.844
{\an8}Hash.

00:08:34.264 --> 00:08:37.100
Hash. Sorry, I wish I could do more.

00:08:41.896 --> 00:08:43.106
Let's go.

00:10:32.298 --> 00:10:33.299
Who are you?

00:10:33.842 --> 00:10:35.718
Intruder, first floor! I need backup!

00:10:43.726 --> 00:10:44.978
- Let go of me.
- Hey!

00:10:45.061 --> 00:10:46.020
I know everything!

00:10:46.646 --> 00:10:49.274
The corruption
involving your medical complex!

00:10:49.357 --> 00:10:52.986
I'll uncover everything
and take down everyone involved!

00:10:53.069 --> 00:10:54.195
You hear me?

00:10:54.279 --> 00:10:55.405
Stay still.

00:10:56.739 --> 00:10:58.700
Everything's screwed up!

00:11:00.285 --> 00:11:02.120
It's all ruined!

00:11:02.203 --> 00:11:04.122
You people did this!

00:11:17.635 --> 00:11:18.761
Where could he be?

00:11:20.263 --> 00:11:21.181
Call him.

00:11:21.264 --> 00:11:22.307
Okay.

00:11:25.602 --> 00:11:26.519
Hello?

00:11:27.103 --> 00:11:28.438
Mr. Park Gi-beom?

00:11:30.106 --> 00:11:31.941
Sorry? The police?

00:11:44.412 --> 00:11:46.706
Mr. Park, your attorney is here.

00:11:52.503 --> 00:11:53.504
Leave.

00:11:53.588 --> 00:11:56.216
I'm sick of attorneys.

00:11:58.676 --> 00:12:00.762
After that terrible incident,

00:12:01.846 --> 00:12:03.765
I went to see several attorneys.

00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:05.975
They say there's no way to win.

00:12:06.643 --> 00:12:09.187
No solutions,
just a fat consultation bill.

00:12:09.979 --> 00:12:11.856
The law? Attorneys?

00:12:12.815 --> 00:12:15.485
I don't need any of that.
I'll take care of it myself.

00:12:15.568 --> 00:12:17.946
I'll uncover everything,
all the corruption,

00:12:18.029 --> 00:12:19.572
and bring them down.

00:12:20.823 --> 00:12:22.075
I don't need you. Go.

00:12:22.825 --> 00:12:26.537
Sir, you've committed
a very serious crime.

00:12:26.621 --> 00:12:29.457
Property damage, obstruction of business,
aggravated damage,

00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:33.544
nighttime trespassing,
and assault on the guards.

00:12:33.628 --> 00:12:35.546
You'll be arrested soon.

00:12:36.089 --> 00:12:40.426
How is it that you attorneys
say exactly the same thing?

00:12:43.471 --> 00:12:44.555
We can't help it.

00:12:48.977 --> 00:12:51.521
Studying law causes
an earthquake in your mind.

00:12:51.604 --> 00:12:53.231
It shifts your mindset.

00:12:55.858 --> 00:12:57.777
After that, we see everything

00:12:57.860 --> 00:12:59.862
from a legal perspective.

00:13:00.488 --> 00:13:01.990
The more you understand the law,

00:13:02.073 --> 00:13:05.493
the more confined your thinking becomes,

00:13:05.576 --> 00:13:07.495
like a small mind trapped by dogma.

00:13:07.578 --> 00:13:09.497
You talk as if you're different.

00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:11.541
That's right.

00:13:11.624 --> 00:13:12.667
Why is that?

00:13:13.876 --> 00:13:16.546
Every lawyer you've talked to was right.

00:13:17.046 --> 00:13:18.798
You can't win this case.

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:24.387
You didn't even listen.
How would you know?

00:13:24.971 --> 00:13:27.015
The lawyers would've
taken the case otherwise.

00:13:27.098 --> 00:13:30.935
Then you wouldn't have snuck
into the clinic at night

00:13:31.019 --> 00:13:34.105
in the name of justice
and ended up fighting the guards.

00:13:34.188 --> 00:13:36.065
You must have a better idea, then.

00:13:38.234 --> 00:13:39.861
I'll have to hear your story first.

00:13:39.944 --> 00:13:41.279
One thing is for sure,

00:13:42.447 --> 00:13:45.074
I don't just fight in the ring.

00:13:45.158 --> 00:13:46.659
If I'm at a disadvantage in the ring,

00:13:46.743 --> 00:13:49.495
I take it outside and finish it there.

00:13:52.373 --> 00:13:55.084
I won't be a legal technician
trapped by dogma.

00:13:55.168 --> 00:13:57.253
I'll stand by your side and help you.

00:14:12.894 --> 00:14:14.187
Where should I start?

00:14:17.023 --> 00:14:19.067
Tell me why you're doing this first.

00:14:24.447 --> 00:14:26.991
I entrusted my sperm
to Hoseon Fertility Clinic,

00:14:28.826 --> 00:14:31.746
and those bastards destroyed
my precious sperm by mistake.

00:14:31.829 --> 00:14:35.291
Sperm? As in male sperm?

00:14:35.375 --> 00:14:36.459
Yes.

00:14:36.542 --> 00:14:38.461
They lost something so precious

00:14:38.544 --> 00:14:40.755
and acted like
it was none of their business.

00:14:41.964 --> 00:14:43.549
I did it because I felt so wronged.

00:14:44.717 --> 00:14:45.802
I see.

00:14:46.636 --> 00:14:48.721
Doesn't the clinic bear
some responsibility?

00:14:48.805 --> 00:14:52.058
They owe me compensation.

00:14:52.141 --> 00:14:55.061
My sperm is worth far more
than that medical equipment.

00:14:55.812 --> 00:14:57.355
If you put a price on it,

00:14:57.438 --> 00:14:59.607
my sperm's worth like ten billion won.

00:15:01.401 --> 00:15:02.610
Ten billion won?

00:15:03.194 --> 00:15:06.030
Why is your estimate so high?

00:15:06.114 --> 00:15:08.658
If it's been lost,
why not store a new sample?

00:15:09.242 --> 00:15:12.537
You're 35.
I'd say you're still in your prime.

00:15:16.791 --> 00:15:17.834
That's impossible.

00:15:19.043 --> 00:15:20.211
Sorry?

00:15:20.294 --> 00:15:21.546
I said that's impossible.

00:15:24.465 --> 00:15:25.591
I'm infertile.

00:15:27.051 --> 00:15:29.554
Infertile? Then how did you
store your sperm?

00:15:30.179 --> 00:15:31.264
A year ago,

00:15:32.014 --> 00:15:34.142
I had testicular cancer and had surgery.

00:15:34.767 --> 00:15:35.893
It left me infertile.

00:15:35.977 --> 00:15:37.186
Gosh.

00:15:38.604 --> 00:15:42.108
The doctor warned me
that I might lose fertility after surgery,

00:15:42.191 --> 00:15:44.485
so I'd stored my sperm before the surgery.

00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:51.534
But when we tried to conceive through IVF…

00:15:58.166 --> 00:15:59.750
The sperm had been ruined.

00:16:01.586 --> 00:16:02.628
Yes.

00:16:04.172 --> 00:16:05.840
That's why I did it.

00:16:07.008 --> 00:16:10.511
And now the clinic says

00:16:11.053 --> 00:16:13.306
they'll do another procedure for free.

00:16:21.939 --> 00:16:22.940
I'm sorry.

00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:29.530
Honestly, in my current situation,

00:16:30.698 --> 00:16:32.575
I can't even afford four million,

00:16:32.658 --> 00:16:34.660
let alone four hundred.

00:16:39.499 --> 00:16:40.917
Let's check the facts first.

00:16:54.347 --> 00:16:56.349
Please. I'm counting on you.

00:16:58.017 --> 00:16:59.435
I'm really relying on you.

00:17:03.773 --> 00:17:05.149
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:17:05.650 --> 00:17:07.401
- This is Attorney Min So-ra.
- Hello.

00:17:09.612 --> 00:17:10.613
This way, please.

00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:15.785
I appreciate you stepping in,
even for something so trivial.

00:17:15.868 --> 00:17:17.036
Thank you.

00:17:17.119 --> 00:17:18.037
Not at all.

00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:19.580
It's only right that I handle it.

00:17:19.664 --> 00:17:21.040
We can't afford any noise

00:17:21.123 --> 00:17:22.875
while the medical complex project
is underway.

00:17:22.959 --> 00:17:26.087
Right. It's such a huge project
that everyone is very nervous.

00:17:26.170 --> 00:17:28.589
They don't want
even the slightest amount of noise.

00:17:28.673 --> 00:17:31.676
Let's settle and wrap it up
as quickly as possible.

00:17:31.759 --> 00:17:32.760
Sure.

00:17:33.261 --> 00:17:35.555
When securing funding,
noise control is key

00:17:35.638 --> 00:17:36.764
during investment reviews.

00:17:36.847 --> 00:17:37.932
Exactly.

00:17:39.976 --> 00:17:41.852
Why was the meeting
scheduled at Yullim, though?

00:17:41.936 --> 00:17:43.187
That's…

00:17:43.271 --> 00:17:45.439
This is all a power game.

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:46.816
Get it together.

00:17:47.483 --> 00:17:48.359
Yes, sir.

00:17:54.824 --> 00:17:55.866
So…

00:18:12.508 --> 00:18:14.427
- We're using the main conference room.
- Okay.

00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:15.720
- Shall we?
- Sure.

00:18:39.118 --> 00:18:42.830
As you know, with charges like
property damage, obstruction of business,

00:18:43.456 --> 00:18:45.541
aggravated damage,
nighttime trespassing, and assault,

00:18:45.625 --> 00:18:49.378
a civil and criminal case
could double the damages,

00:18:49.462 --> 00:18:52.131
and this could result
in immediate detention.

00:18:52.214 --> 00:18:54.675
But considering Mr. Park's situation,

00:18:55.301 --> 00:18:56.552
the clinic is willing

00:18:57.178 --> 00:18:58.846
to show leniency and settle

00:18:58.929 --> 00:19:02.391
with a 400 million won claim
for property damage only.

00:19:02.475 --> 00:19:05.770
A payment of 400 million won
by the end of this month

00:19:05.853 --> 00:19:08.606
and signing a non-contact agreement

00:19:08.689 --> 00:19:11.442
will prevent further legal action.

00:19:13.194 --> 00:19:14.904
My client also suffered losses.

00:19:15.529 --> 00:19:18.407
Since my client's damages
exceed the claim,

00:19:19.075 --> 00:19:20.826
the clinic should offset the claims

00:19:20.910 --> 00:19:22.620
and remit the remaining balance.

00:19:23.621 --> 00:19:24.664
What losses?

00:19:25.164 --> 00:19:26.248
Remaining balance?

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:29.627
My client's sperm has been ruined.

00:19:30.378 --> 00:19:32.421
Didn't you read
the sperm storage agreement?

00:19:32.505 --> 00:19:33.881
I did.

00:19:33.964 --> 00:19:36.550
And you read the disclaimer
and the limitation of liability clause?

00:19:36.634 --> 00:19:38.511
Yes, it was very meticulous.

00:19:38.594 --> 00:19:39.804
{\an8}There are no loopholes, either.

00:19:39.887 --> 00:19:41.889
{\an8}LOOPHOLE: A WAY TO BYPASS THE LAW
WITHOUT BREAKING IT

00:19:41.972 --> 00:19:44.141
Don't you know
that clause doesn't hold up?

00:19:47.103 --> 00:19:48.229
Of course you know.

00:19:48.312 --> 00:19:49.855
Even a first-year knows that.

00:19:49.939 --> 00:19:52.358
- Why is it invalid?
- Under Article 7, Subparagraph 1

00:19:52.441 --> 00:19:54.485
of the Act on the Regulation
of Terms and Conditions,

00:19:54.568 --> 00:19:58.489
any clause that waives
legal liability for intentional misconduct

00:19:58.572 --> 00:20:00.825
or gross negligence

00:20:00.908 --> 00:20:03.953
by the business
or its employees is invalid.

00:20:04.036 --> 00:20:06.205
Whether it was gross negligence or not

00:20:06.288 --> 00:20:08.833
depends on the facts.

00:20:08.916 --> 00:20:11.460
- Let me hear the damage claim first.
- No, there's no need.

00:20:11.544 --> 00:20:12.837
It's 500 million won.

00:20:19.343 --> 00:20:21.679
Easy with the bluffing.

00:20:23.139 --> 00:20:25.599
Are you suggesting
we take this all the way?

00:20:25.683 --> 00:20:28.269
You called us over.
What are you trying to pull?

00:20:29.729 --> 00:20:32.064
That's 100 million won
even after the offset.

00:20:32.148 --> 00:20:34.108
We want the 100 million won in cash.

00:20:36.527 --> 00:20:37.528
Let's go.

00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:44.160
We'll see you in court.

00:20:45.161 --> 00:20:46.245
Sure.

00:20:49.665 --> 00:20:52.126
I heard you were sharp,
but all I see is bluffing.

00:21:09.143 --> 00:21:10.311
Can he…

00:21:10.936 --> 00:21:13.230
really get 500 million won?

00:21:15.191 --> 00:21:16.358
No.

00:21:16.442 --> 00:21:17.401
It's impossible.

00:21:17.902 --> 00:21:20.279
It's difficult to appraise the sperm
at such a high value,

00:21:20.362 --> 00:21:21.989
and even with emotional damages,

00:21:22.573 --> 00:21:25.951
this will probably settle
somewhere in the tens of millions.

00:21:26.035 --> 00:21:27.536
- I was bluffing.
- Sorry?

00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:28.829
Then how…

00:21:28.913 --> 00:21:30.372
We should end it with a deal.

00:21:31.123 --> 00:21:34.710
What matters isn't the legal theory
but your leverage at the table.

00:21:34.794 --> 00:21:37.379
We need something big to turn the tables.

00:21:38.547 --> 00:21:42.176
We haven't found it yet,
so until then, we bluff.

00:21:43.302 --> 00:21:44.512
You're awesome.

00:21:45.262 --> 00:21:47.473
Your outstanding sense of diplomacy…

00:21:47.556 --> 00:21:50.392
Bluffing under the threat
of criminal detention

00:21:50.476 --> 00:21:52.645
isn't just risky. It's reckless.

00:21:55.314 --> 00:21:58.025
What if they snap and say,
"Fine, let's take this all the way"?

00:21:58.108 --> 00:21:59.443
What then?

00:22:02.363 --> 00:22:03.906
Aren't you being reckless?

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:10.830
If they meant to go the distance,

00:22:11.664 --> 00:22:13.415
they wouldn't even have come here.

00:22:14.041 --> 00:22:17.211
Even for a bluff,
the claim amount is way too high.

00:22:18.337 --> 00:22:20.089
Then what's your alternative?

00:22:22.716 --> 00:22:26.846
A complaint without a solution
is just a pile of useless words.

00:22:27.388 --> 00:22:29.223
This is a battle of facts.

00:22:29.807 --> 00:22:32.142
A good litigation attorney
lives in the details.

00:22:32.226 --> 00:22:34.270
We haven't even scratched the surface.

00:22:35.229 --> 00:22:36.897
If we can't win in the ring--

00:22:36.981 --> 00:22:38.566
We crush them outside the ring?

00:22:43.153 --> 00:22:45.322
Go find something
that strengthens our leverage.

00:22:45.406 --> 00:22:47.116
Yes, sir! I'll do my best!

00:22:48.325 --> 00:22:49.702
Okay.

00:22:50.244 --> 00:22:51.161
Hey.

00:22:55.624 --> 00:22:56.750
Yes, sir.

00:23:03.465 --> 00:23:06.385
These are attorneys
Ji Guk-hyeon and Kang Hyo-min.

00:23:06.468 --> 00:23:07.428
I see.

00:23:08.262 --> 00:23:11.140
I brought them here
to get the specifics of the case.

00:23:12.099 --> 00:23:13.350
Okay.

00:23:13.434 --> 00:23:15.227
I have a meeting to get to.

00:23:16.353 --> 00:23:17.438
Mr. Yoon.

00:23:20.482 --> 00:23:22.276
I don't mean to be sexist…

00:23:24.236 --> 00:23:25.696
but given the subject matter,

00:23:26.238 --> 00:23:28.365
I feel uncomfortable
around a female attorney.

00:23:30.367 --> 00:23:31.952
Please don't get me wrong.

00:23:32.036 --> 00:23:34.121
Some of the terms
are awkward to say out loud.

00:23:35.164 --> 00:23:38.292
Plus, I get shy easily,
so I'm not good with my words.

00:23:39.752 --> 00:23:41.587
I'll be outside.

00:23:42.338 --> 00:23:45.633
I'll get the details from Mr. Ji later.

00:23:45.716 --> 00:23:47.051
I'm sorry.

00:23:47.134 --> 00:23:48.135
It's fine.

00:23:56.602 --> 00:23:59.188
You can talk to me.

00:24:01.857 --> 00:24:04.735
He just treated you as a woman,
not as his attorney.

00:24:05.819 --> 00:24:07.321
How can you back down so easily?

00:24:09.073 --> 00:24:12.284
Can you really defend others
when you can't even defend yourself?

00:24:16.997 --> 00:24:18.916
Jeez.

00:24:18.999 --> 00:24:21.543
What can I do? That was the client's wish.

00:24:21.627 --> 00:24:22.962
What am I supposed to do?

00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:26.131
What's wrong?

00:24:26.215 --> 00:24:27.383
Hi.

00:24:28.008 --> 00:24:28.926
He's prickly, right?

00:24:29.718 --> 00:24:30.928
Yes.

00:24:31.470 --> 00:24:33.681
He seems cold, but he's kind.

00:24:34.348 --> 00:24:35.349
No way.

00:24:36.016 --> 00:24:39.478
You were good from the start,
so you never saw his rough side.

00:24:39.561 --> 00:24:40.562
Not at all.

00:24:40.646 --> 00:24:41.814
When I was in law school,

00:24:41.897 --> 00:24:44.149
{\an8}I was Mr. Yoon's paralegal
for over three years.

00:24:44.233 --> 00:24:45.275
{\an8}You were?

00:24:45.359 --> 00:24:47.444
He and I go way back.

00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:49.071
Good luck.

00:24:53.659 --> 00:24:54.576
Paralegal…

00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:56.036
Yoon?

00:25:03.168 --> 00:25:04.211
What did Mr. Park say?

00:25:04.294 --> 00:25:07.214
I don't get what he's saying at all.

00:25:08.674 --> 00:25:10.759
Didn't you talk to him for two hours?

00:25:10.843 --> 00:25:13.345
Exactly. He kept going on
about useless stuff.

00:25:13.429 --> 00:25:14.388
About what?

00:25:14.471 --> 00:25:17.307
First, it was corruption
in the integrated medical complex,

00:25:17.391 --> 00:25:20.519
then something about the clinic
being tied to someone powerful,

00:25:20.602 --> 00:25:22.855
then how we have to expose everything
about the fraud.

00:25:22.938 --> 00:25:24.815
Then the mention of a monster…

00:25:25.566 --> 00:25:27.026
"Monster"?

00:25:27.943 --> 00:25:28.819
I have zero energy.

00:25:29.570 --> 00:25:30.612
Tell me more.

00:25:30.696 --> 00:25:32.197
Hey.

00:25:32.865 --> 00:25:35.492
I'm sending you the recording.
Listen to it yourself.

00:25:35.993 --> 00:25:37.870
Way to go, Ji Guk-hyeon!

00:25:37.953 --> 00:25:40.789
I did my best for you, colleague.

00:25:40.873 --> 00:25:42.041
Thank you, colleague.

00:25:47.337 --> 00:25:48.422
Ye-rim heard…

00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:51.091
everything at the clinic.

00:25:52.176 --> 00:25:54.261
"What if it's a monster?"

00:25:55.012 --> 00:25:55.971
Monster.

00:25:58.057 --> 00:25:59.850
"What if it's a monster?"

00:26:00.934 --> 00:26:02.102
Monster.

00:26:03.270 --> 00:26:04.563
"What if it's a monster?"

00:26:07.232 --> 00:26:08.817
"What if it's a monster?"

00:26:09.985 --> 00:26:11.070
Monster.

00:26:22.623 --> 00:26:23.624
Mr. Park?

00:26:24.249 --> 00:26:26.085
This is Kang Hyo-min from Yullim.

00:26:26.585 --> 00:26:28.962
Could I talk to you for a moment tomorrow?

00:26:44.895 --> 00:26:47.648
Isn't the male attorney coming?

00:26:47.731 --> 00:26:48.774
No.

00:26:49.733 --> 00:26:52.152
It's just you and me today.

00:26:54.113 --> 00:26:55.697
The thing is, I…

00:26:55.781 --> 00:27:00.244
Sex, testicular cancer,
infertility, sperm…

00:27:02.204 --> 00:27:06.917
They're simply terms used
to specify and differentiate.

00:27:13.006 --> 00:27:16.718
Do you know what my professor said
the moment she walked in

00:27:17.219 --> 00:27:20.097
on the first day
of my law school class on sex crimes?

00:27:21.765 --> 00:27:24.393
Penis, vagina…

00:27:24.476 --> 00:27:26.436
- Penetration.
- Oral sex.

00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:27.855
Anal sex.

00:27:28.772 --> 00:27:31.608
After repeating them
three times, she said…

00:27:32.734 --> 00:27:35.737
"Here, these words
are not to be spoken with emotion

00:27:35.821 --> 00:27:37.322
or embarrassment."

00:27:38.282 --> 00:27:42.578
"They're just nouns
used to describe a case."

00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:49.459
I guess I should have
thought that through.

00:27:50.210 --> 00:27:53.255
If it's okay, shall we talk?

00:27:54.756 --> 00:27:55.966
Okay, let's do that.

00:28:37.841 --> 00:28:39.176
Yes?

00:28:40.344 --> 00:28:41.720
What is it?

00:28:41.803 --> 00:28:43.430
I found the game changer.

00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:47.100
The case of Mr. Park's destroyed sperm.

00:28:48.810 --> 00:28:52.689
COURT

00:28:52.773 --> 00:28:54.942
{\an8}Defense counsel,
are you filing a countersuit?

00:28:55.025 --> 00:28:56.818
{\an8}HOSEON FERTILITY CLINIC
PROPERTY DAMAGE CASE

00:28:57.986 --> 00:28:59.029
{\an8}Yes, Your Honor.

00:28:59.863 --> 00:29:01.782
The plaintiff had a duty

00:29:01.865 --> 00:29:05.619
{\an8}to store the defendant's sperm with
the care expected of a prudent manager.

00:29:05.702 --> 00:29:08.121
{\an8}However, the plaintiff
violated the duty of care

00:29:08.205 --> 00:29:09.873
and destroyed the defendant's sperm.

00:29:09.957 --> 00:29:12.751
And we're claiming
500 million won in damages.

00:29:13.377 --> 00:29:14.711
- What? 500 million?
- What?

00:29:15.754 --> 00:29:16.838
Did you say 500 million?

00:29:19.091 --> 00:29:20.008
{\an8}Yes, Your Honor.

00:29:20.634 --> 00:29:21.927
We demand 500 million won.

00:29:25.055 --> 00:29:27.432
Plaintiff's counsel, what do you say?

00:29:29.977 --> 00:29:33.230
We admit the sperm was lost
due to negligence.

00:29:33.313 --> 00:29:36.400
{\an8}But even with the defendant's situation,

00:29:36.483 --> 00:29:38.986
the damages should
not exceed 20 million won.

00:29:39.069 --> 00:29:42.197
A countersuit of 500 million won
borders on absurdity.

00:29:42.281 --> 00:29:44.533
This court is not a stage for theatrics.

00:29:44.616 --> 00:29:45.701
What a load of crap…

00:29:46.618 --> 00:29:49.121
Counsel, this is a courtroom.

00:29:51.498 --> 00:29:52.416
Your Honor,

00:29:52.916 --> 00:29:54.418
you heard the defendant's argument.

00:29:54.501 --> 00:29:56.420
The claim itself is unfounded,

00:29:56.503 --> 00:29:59.589
and the sum of 500 million won
is clearly unreasonable.

00:30:00.924 --> 00:30:04.177
Clarify why the defendant is demanding

00:30:04.261 --> 00:30:05.137
500 million won.

00:30:07.306 --> 00:30:08.223
It's simple.

00:30:08.307 --> 00:30:11.768
Under a deposit contract,
if an item worth 500 million won is lost

00:30:11.852 --> 00:30:16.315
due to the custodian's fault
during the deposit period,

00:30:16.398 --> 00:30:19.067
they are liable to compensate

00:30:19.151 --> 00:30:21.737
the full amount
under the terms of the deposit.

00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:25.157
So you're saying the defendant's sperm

00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:27.367
is worth 500 million won?

00:30:28.452 --> 00:30:29.411
Yes, Your Honor.

00:30:29.494 --> 00:30:30.787
Defense counsel,

00:30:31.371 --> 00:30:34.166
submit proof to justify
the 500 million won amount.

00:30:34.249 --> 00:30:35.250
I will, Your Honor.

00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:40.255
I request a party examination
of the defendant, Mr. Park Gi-beom.

00:30:42.841 --> 00:30:46.136
Why did you damage
the plaintiff's property?

00:30:51.975 --> 00:30:53.685
When I heard my sperm was ruined…

00:30:56.229 --> 00:30:57.105
I don't know.

00:30:59.149 --> 00:31:00.275
I was so…

00:31:02.152 --> 00:31:05.113
Is the loss of sperm really
something to be that devastated about?

00:31:06.031 --> 00:31:08.950
Sperm can be produced continuously.

00:31:09.034 --> 00:31:10.619
No, it cannot.

00:31:14.539 --> 00:31:15.832
I'm infertile.

00:31:21.588 --> 00:31:23.090
I…

00:31:25.842 --> 00:31:26.843
A year ago,

00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:29.721
I got testicular cancer.

00:31:31.348 --> 00:31:34.226
They told me I needed surgery right away.

00:31:34.851 --> 00:31:36.103
The doctor said

00:31:37.187 --> 00:31:39.314
I'd make a full recovery
after the surgery,

00:31:40.357 --> 00:31:41.817
but I might become infertile.

00:31:43.276 --> 00:31:44.361
I see.

00:31:44.444 --> 00:31:46.238
When I heard that…

00:31:48.698 --> 00:31:50.409
My mind went blank.

00:31:51.201 --> 00:31:52.285
Because…

00:31:53.203 --> 00:31:54.246
my wife,

00:31:55.205 --> 00:31:57.207
who was my fiancée at the time,

00:31:57.833 --> 00:32:01.670
wanted a child more than anything.

00:32:02.963 --> 00:32:05.590
Wanting a child
is understandable for any couple.

00:32:06.091 --> 00:32:09.719
You sounded especially desperate.
Is there a reason?

00:32:17.686 --> 00:32:18.562
There is.

00:32:20.063 --> 00:32:21.273
To tell you the truth…

00:32:50.927 --> 00:32:54.681
The woman who just entered the courtroom…

00:32:56.349 --> 00:32:57.392
is my wife.

00:32:58.685 --> 00:33:01.771
What happened to her face?

00:33:18.705 --> 00:33:19.748
That's my wife.

00:33:22.334 --> 00:33:25.212
She's the most beautiful
and precious person to me.

00:33:32.636 --> 00:33:36.097
That's my wife.

00:33:41.645 --> 00:33:43.355
Has your wife made a decision?

00:33:44.064 --> 00:33:45.023
Not yet.

00:33:45.982 --> 00:33:48.235
I'm not sure
about putting Ye-rim out there.

00:33:50.237 --> 00:33:53.573
It just feels like I'm turning her
into a spectacle to save myself.

00:33:56.451 --> 00:33:57.869
Where is she now?

00:33:59.079 --> 00:34:00.038
Ms. Lee,

00:34:00.622 --> 00:34:01.790
can you hear me?

00:34:02.707 --> 00:34:06.753
If you're embarrassed
to stand in front of people,

00:34:07.629 --> 00:34:09.422
what's truly embarrassing

00:34:09.923 --> 00:34:11.466
isn't your appearance.

00:34:12.175 --> 00:34:13.760
What's truly embarrassing

00:34:13.843 --> 00:34:17.681
is you shrinking yourself under the gaze
of people who don't matter to you

00:34:17.764 --> 00:34:20.433
and trapping yourself in the words

00:34:20.517 --> 00:34:22.686
of those who spew them out like waste.

00:34:22.769 --> 00:34:24.187
Their stares

00:34:24.854 --> 00:34:25.855
and words

00:34:26.398 --> 00:34:27.899
carry no meaning,

00:34:27.983 --> 00:34:30.777
no value, and no responsibility.

00:34:31.403 --> 00:34:34.281
No one can speak for you, Ms. Lee.

00:34:34.990 --> 00:34:36.658
Only you can do it.

00:34:36.741 --> 00:34:38.868
Please fight alongside
the person you love.

00:34:39.494 --> 00:34:40.912
I'll help you.

00:34:45.083 --> 00:34:46.084
Let's go.

00:35:15.822 --> 00:35:16.990
Order!

00:35:19.659 --> 00:35:21.369
COURT IN SESSION

00:35:21.453 --> 00:35:23.121
Three years ago, my wife suffered

00:35:23.204 --> 00:35:26.166
severe burns to her face
and body in an unexpected accident.

00:35:26.958 --> 00:35:28.877
It was a tragic accident that happened

00:35:29.502 --> 00:35:31.212
just as we were planning our wedding.

00:35:37.927 --> 00:35:39.471
Will you marry me?

00:36:09.709 --> 00:36:11.878
My wife, who was my fiancée at the time,

00:36:13.672 --> 00:36:16.216
suffered severe burns
to her face and body.

00:36:17.467 --> 00:36:19.052
It was incredibly hard on her.

00:36:20.387 --> 00:36:21.763
Ye-rim!

00:36:21.846 --> 00:36:24.683
She said she couldn't bear
looking like a monster…

00:36:26.893 --> 00:36:29.604
and disappeared,
saying she wanted to break up with me.

00:36:33.650 --> 00:36:34.734
She even tried…

00:36:36.861 --> 00:36:38.029
to take her own life.

00:36:45.203 --> 00:36:46.454
Please help me.

00:36:47.122 --> 00:36:49.040
Still, I couldn't let her go.

00:36:50.667 --> 00:36:51.668
Gi-beom!

00:36:52.293 --> 00:36:53.169
Please!

00:36:54.838 --> 00:36:55.797
Just go.

00:36:56.631 --> 00:36:59.050
Because to me, she was still the person…

00:36:59.134 --> 00:37:00.218
I'm begging you.

00:37:02.470 --> 00:37:04.347
…I knew and loved.

00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:09.936
I didn't want to lose her,

00:37:10.770 --> 00:37:12.731
so I followed her persistently.

00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:15.608
She would run,
and I would chase after her.

00:37:15.692 --> 00:37:16.735
Then I'd find her again.

00:37:17.777 --> 00:37:20.113
After all that chasing and pleading,

00:37:21.573 --> 00:37:23.074
we finally got back together.

00:37:26.745 --> 00:37:27.996
Listen carefully, Ye-rim.

00:37:31.708 --> 00:37:34.544
People will always stare at you.

00:37:36.045 --> 00:37:37.088
They'll also see me.

00:37:38.590 --> 00:37:39.591
And they'll notice…

00:37:42.093 --> 00:37:44.012
the way I'm looking at you.

00:37:45.847 --> 00:37:46.890
They'll envy you

00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:49.768
because you're loved in a way…

00:37:52.103 --> 00:37:53.855
they've never known.

00:37:55.774 --> 00:37:58.359
Hold your head high and look at me.

00:38:10.497 --> 00:38:12.624
I heard their black tea is really good.

00:38:16.461 --> 00:38:18.671
I know you love black tea.

00:38:18.755 --> 00:38:22.467
I was panicking earlier,
but I still looked for a place you'd like,

00:38:23.134 --> 00:38:25.220
just to treat you to something delicious.

00:38:27.222 --> 00:38:28.431
Thank you.

00:38:29.098 --> 00:38:30.642
Let's start over.

00:38:45.031 --> 00:38:46.574
Kang Hyo-min, my darling,

00:38:47.784 --> 00:38:50.286
will you marry me?

00:38:52.997 --> 00:38:54.457
I have something to say.

00:38:57.502 --> 00:38:59.087
You're making me nervous.

00:39:00.255 --> 00:39:01.464
What is it?

00:39:05.718 --> 00:39:07.804
Here's the black tea you ordered.

00:39:13.268 --> 00:39:16.521
You never know how strong a tea bag is
until you put it in hot water.

00:39:18.064 --> 00:39:21.860
You can't tell how strong a tea bag is
just by looking at it.

00:39:24.028 --> 00:39:26.114
The moment hot water touches the tea bag,

00:39:26.698 --> 00:39:29.409
a deep orange bloom
unfurls from the tea bag.

00:39:30.159 --> 00:39:33.997
That's when it really shows its strength.

00:39:38.585 --> 00:39:41.713
So, what is it that you want to say?

00:39:42.338 --> 00:39:43.673
I'm not an only child.

00:39:43.756 --> 00:39:45.091
What?

00:39:45.884 --> 00:39:48.052
I have an identical twin sister.

00:39:49.429 --> 00:39:52.640
My sister was born
with a genetic hearing impairment.

00:39:54.434 --> 00:39:56.269
You're kidding, right?

00:39:56.352 --> 00:39:58.438
My mom has three brothers and a sister.

00:39:58.521 --> 00:40:01.274
My aunt and her husband
are hearing-impaired.

00:40:02.901 --> 00:40:05.528
My sister was adopted
by my aunt when she was five.

00:40:08.031 --> 00:40:10.700
I guess my parents thought
it'd be better for her

00:40:10.783 --> 00:40:13.620
to grow up with my aunt
rather than among hearing people.

00:40:15.038 --> 00:40:16.789
So, what are you going to do?

00:40:16.873 --> 00:40:18.499
I need to think about this.

00:40:19.208 --> 00:40:20.752
What is there to think about?

00:40:21.377 --> 00:40:23.338
Are you saying you will abandon her

00:40:23.421 --> 00:40:25.131
because she's hearing-impaired?

00:40:26.132 --> 00:40:27.759
Watch what you're saying.

00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:30.887
Your mother has a point.

00:40:31.763 --> 00:40:35.016
My sister doesn't have a child,
and she wants to adopt.

00:40:35.099 --> 00:40:37.810
It might be better
for my sister's family to raise her…

00:40:39.479 --> 00:40:41.522
rather than us hearing people.

00:40:43.441 --> 00:40:44.567
So you're saying

00:40:45.777 --> 00:40:48.154
we'll keep Hyo-min, who's perfectly fine,

00:40:48.237 --> 00:40:50.073
but send Hyo-ju away to your sister…

00:40:52.158 --> 00:40:53.785
because she's disabled.

00:41:03.378 --> 00:41:05.880
My sister and I looked so alike.

00:41:06.714 --> 00:41:09.217
Even our parents
used to get us mixed up sometimes.

00:41:10.176 --> 00:41:12.261
The only difference was our hair.

00:41:12.345 --> 00:41:13.888
I had a short bob,

00:41:13.972 --> 00:41:15.723
and my sister had long hair.

00:41:16.307 --> 00:41:18.726
I think Mom and Dad did that on purpose

00:41:18.810 --> 00:41:20.561
so they wouldn't mix us up.

00:41:20.645 --> 00:41:21.521
KANG HYO-MIN

00:41:21.604 --> 00:41:25.066
That day, I thought
if we looked exactly the same,

00:41:26.150 --> 00:41:28.945
they wouldn't be able to send her away.

00:41:30.363 --> 00:41:31.447
That's why

00:41:31.531 --> 00:41:34.075
I cut her hair and made a big mess.

00:41:46.754 --> 00:41:49.549
No! Don't take Hyo-ju away!

00:41:52.719 --> 00:41:57.056
Don't take Hyo-ju away!

00:41:58.266 --> 00:42:01.352
Don't take Hyo-ju away!

00:42:04.272 --> 00:42:05.940
Let me get this straight.

00:42:06.024 --> 00:42:09.277
Your identical twin has
a hereditary hearing disability,

00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:11.112
and she was adopted by your aunt,

00:42:11.195 --> 00:42:13.573
who is also hearing-impaired.

00:42:13.656 --> 00:42:17.326
And you're telling me all this just now?

00:42:17.410 --> 00:42:19.287
I wasn't trying to hide it.

00:42:19.787 --> 00:42:22.999
I never found the right moment.

00:42:26.544 --> 00:42:28.796
Give me some time to think.

00:42:29.756 --> 00:42:30.882
Time to think?

00:42:30.965 --> 00:42:33.926
I need some time
to process this new information.

00:42:34.886 --> 00:42:35.845
Okay.

00:42:36.971 --> 00:42:38.973
Let's go before traffic gets bad.

00:42:40.391 --> 00:42:43.352
Let's have dinner some other time.
I'm swamped with work.

00:42:53.321 --> 00:42:54.947
The same goes for love.

00:42:55.865 --> 00:42:57.492
You won't know how strong it is

00:42:58.451 --> 00:43:00.369
until it's tested in boiling water.

00:43:04.123 --> 00:43:06.125
After all my pleading and chasing,

00:43:06.959 --> 00:43:09.170
we began talking
about getting married again.

00:43:12.298 --> 00:43:14.425
But while preparing for the wedding,

00:43:15.384 --> 00:43:17.345
even while trying on wedding dresses,

00:43:18.387 --> 00:43:21.307
Ye-rim couldn't bring herself
to look in the mirror.

00:43:23.601 --> 00:43:24.519
Then…

00:43:24.602 --> 00:43:26.437
- Gi-beom, let's go.
- Ye-rim.

00:43:27.855 --> 00:43:28.856
Ye-rim.

00:43:28.940 --> 00:43:31.150
My wife started to get better.

00:43:32.068 --> 00:43:33.194
It may have been Seo-yeon,

00:43:34.237 --> 00:43:35.154
our niece.

00:43:36.572 --> 00:43:40.827
I think it started when
my wife's younger sister had a daughter.

00:43:42.286 --> 00:43:44.622
Seeing Seo-yeon,
the spitting image of her sister,

00:43:45.581 --> 00:43:49.293
she slowly began to brighten up,
filled with hope

00:43:50.002 --> 00:43:51.963
that she could one day have a child

00:43:53.422 --> 00:43:54.632
who resembled…

00:43:56.551 --> 00:43:58.386
the way she looked before the burns.

00:44:00.513 --> 00:44:02.140
Everything started…

00:44:03.683 --> 00:44:05.351
to brighten up miraculously.

00:44:06.727 --> 00:44:07.854
Then,

00:44:08.646 --> 00:44:12.066
I got diagnosed with testicular cancer
a month before our wedding.

00:44:15.361 --> 00:44:18.656
I had to get surgery immediately,
or it could have been life-threatening.

00:44:20.324 --> 00:44:23.077
The doctor said I could make
a full recovery…

00:44:25.371 --> 00:44:26.789
but I could become infertile.

00:44:27.415 --> 00:44:28.499
I knew

00:44:29.041 --> 00:44:32.044
how desperately my wife wanted
to have a child,

00:44:32.128 --> 00:44:33.796
so I was devastated.

00:44:36.299 --> 00:44:37.383
But my wife…

00:44:40.511 --> 00:44:42.388
was actually calmer than I was.

00:44:43.347 --> 00:44:44.473
She said it was okay.

00:44:44.974 --> 00:44:46.392
She reassured me.

00:44:48.603 --> 00:44:50.354
She said that
thanks to technology these days,

00:44:50.438 --> 00:44:53.191
{\an8}we could store the sperm
and get the surgery.

00:44:53.816 --> 00:44:55.067
So we went…

00:44:58.487 --> 00:45:01.991
to Hoseon Fertility Clinic,
which claimed to be

00:45:02.867 --> 00:45:04.577
the best in the field.

00:45:04.660 --> 00:45:05.912
TOP INFERTILITY SPECIALISTS

00:45:05.995 --> 00:45:08.247
Sperm freezing may sound complicated,

00:45:08.372 --> 00:45:09.498
but it really isn't.

00:45:09.582 --> 00:45:11.209
It's a very simple procedure.

00:45:11.876 --> 00:45:14.795
The coordinator explained
everything clearly and professionally.

00:45:14.879 --> 00:45:15.796
SPERM FREEZING

00:45:15.880 --> 00:45:16.881
Above all,

00:45:17.506 --> 00:45:19.634
they said they had
the world's best preservation clinic.

00:45:19.717 --> 00:45:21.928
I knew this was it after the consultation.

00:45:22.595 --> 00:45:24.263
There was no reason to hesitate.

00:45:26.182 --> 00:45:28.309
So we made a decision on the spot.

00:45:31.979 --> 00:45:35.149
We truly believed Hoseon Clinic
would live up to its reputation

00:45:35.233 --> 00:45:38.861
and take care of everything,
just as sincerely as we hoped.

00:45:38.945 --> 00:45:40.738
OPERATING ROOM

00:45:40.821 --> 00:45:43.074
- After leaving the sperm in their care…
- It'll be fine.

00:45:43.574 --> 00:45:47.078
…I could go into surgery
with a little more peace of mind.

00:45:48.663 --> 00:45:50.581
The surgery went very well.

00:45:50.665 --> 00:45:52.917
I'm so glad. Thank you, Doctor.

00:45:53.417 --> 00:45:54.293
But…

00:45:57.296 --> 00:45:58.965
But as feared,

00:46:00.466 --> 00:46:02.134
I became infertile.

00:46:04.095 --> 00:46:07.807
Even so, we weren't too discouraged.

00:46:07.890 --> 00:46:09.433
Hoseon Fertility Clinic still had

00:46:09.517 --> 00:46:12.144
the sperm we had entrusted to them.

00:46:12.228 --> 00:46:13.521
But…

00:46:15.773 --> 00:46:16.649
But…

00:46:18.776 --> 00:46:19.860
The sperm got ruined.

00:46:22.446 --> 00:46:24.198
Due to the plaintiff's careless handling…

00:46:25.574 --> 00:46:27.243
WITNESS STAND

00:46:27.868 --> 00:46:30.371
Everything fell apart.

00:46:31.038 --> 00:46:32.999
The person I love…

00:46:38.254 --> 00:46:40.715
has endured unimaginable pain…

00:46:43.092 --> 00:46:45.511
just with the hope
of having a child who resembles her.

00:46:48.681 --> 00:46:50.891
I was so afraid…

00:46:52.977 --> 00:46:55.688
she might leave me again.

00:46:57.732 --> 00:46:59.150
But Hoseon Fertility Clinic…

00:47:00.234 --> 00:47:03.404
Instead of apologizing to us…

00:47:03.487 --> 00:47:06.824
I said we'd do the procedure again.

00:47:06.907 --> 00:47:08.993
We'll cover the cost.

00:47:09.076 --> 00:47:10.161
What?

00:47:11.287 --> 00:47:12.705
Do you hear yourself?

00:47:13.205 --> 00:47:15.207
I told you. I'm infertile!

00:47:17.001 --> 00:47:18.878
But this is not our fault.

00:47:18.961 --> 00:47:22.381
- Look.
- Please stop making a scene.

00:47:22.465 --> 00:47:24.717
- You people are crazy!
- Gi-beom, let's just…

00:47:25.343 --> 00:47:26.886
talk outside, okay?

00:47:26.969 --> 00:47:29.847
They were whispering among themselves.

00:47:29.930 --> 00:47:32.183
Let's go for now.

00:47:32.266 --> 00:47:34.143
Look at her. How can she have a baby?

00:47:34.226 --> 00:47:36.103
What if the baby
turns out to be a monster?

00:47:36.187 --> 00:47:37.188
Don't be stupid.

00:47:37.271 --> 00:47:38.731
She can't have always been that way.

00:47:38.814 --> 00:47:40.691
Then will the baby look fine?

00:47:40.775 --> 00:47:41.734
I think so.

00:47:43.110 --> 00:47:46.572
Still, it's better off this way.
The mother is a monster.

00:47:47.782 --> 00:47:50.659
They called an unborn child a monster.

00:47:53.037 --> 00:47:55.039
Hearing that made my wife

00:47:55.873 --> 00:47:58.542
retreat from the world once more.

00:47:59.835 --> 00:48:01.003
I see.

00:48:02.713 --> 00:48:04.298
That's why you made a scene.

00:48:10.346 --> 00:48:12.932
Isn't that Mr. Hwang,
a reporter from Hansang Daily?

00:48:15.893 --> 00:48:17.853
Damn it, you have got to be kidding me.

00:48:21.315 --> 00:48:23.901
Pursuant to Article 393 of the Civil Act,

00:48:23.984 --> 00:48:28.280
damages from a breach of obligation are,
as a rule, limited to ordinary damages.

00:48:28.823 --> 00:48:32.326
But if the obligor knew or could have
known about special circumstances,

00:48:32.410 --> 00:48:35.371
{\an8}they're also liable for special damages.

00:48:35.454 --> 00:48:37.498
The defendant
repeatedly informed the plaintiff

00:48:37.581 --> 00:48:38.624
about his wife's burns,

00:48:38.707 --> 00:48:39.959
the risk of infertility,

00:48:40.042 --> 00:48:45.756
and the potential that this would be
their last batch of sperm.

00:48:45.840 --> 00:48:48.467
Therefore, the plaintiff
could have reasonably foreseen

00:48:48.551 --> 00:48:50.803
that failure to fulfill the duty
of safekeeping would cause

00:48:50.886 --> 00:48:52.888
significant harm to the defendant.

00:48:53.431 --> 00:48:55.891
Therefore, compensation must be made

00:48:55.975 --> 00:48:58.102
for special damages, not ordinary damages.

00:48:59.061 --> 00:49:00.062
What do we do now?

00:49:00.604 --> 00:49:03.107
Five hundred million won
is impossible anyway.

00:49:06.318 --> 00:49:09.071
{\an8}A loss that took away
one person's hope in life…

00:49:09.947 --> 00:49:12.992
A loss that stole
their only chance to become parents…

00:49:13.075 --> 00:49:16.996
If you had to put a price on that loss,
how much would it be?

00:49:17.621 --> 00:49:18.873
Five hundred million won?

00:49:19.457 --> 00:49:20.791
Would that be enough?

00:49:23.127 --> 00:49:25.171
Do you still believe the 500 million won

00:49:26.672 --> 00:49:28.924
the defendant is asking for is excessive,

00:49:29.008 --> 00:49:31.343
considering the loss they suffered?

00:49:33.012 --> 00:49:35.764
{\an8}We would be cutting off our nose
just to spite our face.

00:49:36.265 --> 00:49:38.225
{\an8}Stop the lawsuit immediately.

00:49:42.313 --> 00:49:45.149
Your Honor, we'd like
to request a brief recess.

00:49:45.858 --> 00:49:47.193
Granted.

00:49:48.110 --> 00:49:50.988
We will resume after a short recess.

00:49:56.619 --> 00:49:57.620
Thank you.

00:50:03.751 --> 00:50:06.045
Mr. Yoon, I found the game changer.

00:50:07.463 --> 00:50:09.507
The case of Mr. Park's destroyed sperm.

00:50:10.257 --> 00:50:12.176
I get what you mean,

00:50:12.259 --> 00:50:14.220
but even with the sperm loss

00:50:14.303 --> 00:50:16.972
and burn injuries
considered as special damages,

00:50:17.056 --> 00:50:18.599
isn't 500 million won too much?

00:50:19.767 --> 00:50:20.768
It is not.

00:50:21.852 --> 00:50:23.395
We may be powerless in the ring,

00:50:23.479 --> 00:50:25.856
but outside the ring,
our power is news value.

00:50:28.734 --> 00:50:31.320
Our opponent is sensitive
to public sentiment.

00:50:31.403 --> 00:50:34.406
A court ruling was never
what we were after from the start.

00:50:35.366 --> 00:50:37.868
It was about
gaining leverage in the negotiation.

00:50:37.952 --> 00:50:38.869
Excuse me.

00:50:45.876 --> 00:50:48.379
Hello, Mr. Hwang.
This is Lee Jin-woo from Yullim.

00:50:48.462 --> 00:50:50.172
Yes, it's been a while.

00:50:50.256 --> 00:50:52.716
You see, we're in the middle
of a personal lawsuit

00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:54.552
against Hoseon Fertility Clinic,

00:50:54.635 --> 00:50:57.263
and the story is quite compelling.

00:51:04.770 --> 00:51:06.230
Let's have a word.

00:51:11.902 --> 00:51:14.863
Is Mr. Hwang from Hansang Daily
part of your play?

00:51:14.947 --> 00:51:16.073
Yes.

00:51:16.657 --> 00:51:22.705
Your client poured billions
into that medical complex project,

00:51:23.455 --> 00:51:25.791
but public sentiment's not in your favor.

00:51:25.874 --> 00:51:28.586
In this climate,
one drop of fuel is all it takes.

00:51:29.086 --> 00:51:30.421
Classic case of overkill.

00:51:33.299 --> 00:51:34.383
Let's settle.

00:51:36.093 --> 00:51:37.094
What are the terms?

00:51:37.636 --> 00:51:40.598
This case must not be
reported by any media outlet.

00:51:41.140 --> 00:51:44.810
From this moment on, the defendant
is not to discuss this case with anyone.

00:51:45.519 --> 00:51:48.981
On that condition, we'll drop
all civil and criminal charges at no cost.

00:51:49.064 --> 00:51:50.232
We'll take that.

00:51:51.275 --> 00:51:54.486
However, this is on the condition
that Hoseon pays Mr. Park

00:51:54.570 --> 00:51:57.531
100 million won in damages.

00:51:58.407 --> 00:52:00.200
Do you think that makes any sense?

00:52:01.619 --> 00:52:03.078
Or we could proceed.

00:52:03.162 --> 00:52:04.204
Look.

00:52:04.747 --> 00:52:06.457
To get 100 million after offsets,

00:52:06.540 --> 00:52:08.292
the damages should be set at 500 million.

00:52:08.375 --> 00:52:10.169
You know that's not feasible.

00:52:12.755 --> 00:52:14.882
In a lawsuit, it's not about who wins.

00:52:15.424 --> 00:52:17.426
It's about who gets hurt less.

00:52:18.427 --> 00:52:19.345
Well, then.

00:52:22.640 --> 00:52:24.183
One, two, three.

00:52:25.684 --> 00:52:27.102
Fine, we'll take the deal.

00:52:34.610 --> 00:52:36.445
Will you take care of Mr. Hwang?

00:52:36.528 --> 00:52:38.489
Do you have another story to feed him?

00:52:39.823 --> 00:52:42.034
Do you think
I brought him here with no plan B?

00:52:44.078 --> 00:52:46.163
I'll send over the settlement agreement.

00:52:46.246 --> 00:52:49.249
If it's not signed within three days,
the offer will be void.

00:52:49.333 --> 00:52:50.209
Okay.

00:52:56.882 --> 00:52:58.926
I'll explain inside.

00:53:00.094 --> 00:53:01.011
Please.

00:53:47.391 --> 00:53:48.684
What?

00:53:48.767 --> 00:53:51.729
I'm still reviewing the case,
so I haven't written it yet.

00:53:51.812 --> 00:53:52.730
Look here.

00:53:53.689 --> 00:53:55.107
I gave you three whole days.

00:53:55.190 --> 00:53:56.692
And today's the deadline.

00:53:57.651 --> 00:54:00.404
That deadline was set unilaterally by you,

00:54:01.029 --> 00:54:03.073
and it was unreasonable from the start.

00:54:03.157 --> 00:54:06.910
Even a first-year
could have written it in half a day.

00:54:06.994 --> 00:54:09.663
I've looked it over,
but it's a complicated case.

00:54:09.747 --> 00:54:10.748
I'll need more time.

00:54:10.831 --> 00:54:12.791
Tell me how it's so complicated.

00:54:13.834 --> 00:54:15.377
I can't remember every detail.

00:54:15.461 --> 00:54:16.628
What's the key point?

00:54:16.712 --> 00:54:18.046
I'll need to look at the document.

00:54:18.130 --> 00:54:19.089
You said you read it!

00:54:19.173 --> 00:54:20.215
Yes.

00:54:20.299 --> 00:54:21.216
I did,

00:54:21.300 --> 00:54:24.553
but I don't have it with me,
so I can't recall the details.

00:54:24.636 --> 00:54:26.430
Are you messing with me?

00:54:26.513 --> 00:54:27.723
Why are you yelling at me?

00:54:27.806 --> 00:54:28.766
What?

00:54:28.849 --> 00:54:31.143
This is workplace harassment.

00:54:33.270 --> 00:54:34.146
What's going on?

00:54:34.229 --> 00:54:35.314
What is it?

00:54:38.525 --> 00:54:42.279
I asked him to draft
a statement for a simple case,

00:54:43.030 --> 00:54:44.239
but he missed the deadline.

00:54:44.323 --> 00:54:46.492
- And?
- It's not exactly a difficult case.

00:54:47.117 --> 00:54:48.952
It was a half-day's task,

00:54:49.036 --> 00:54:51.246
but he still didn't get
the key points after three days,

00:54:51.330 --> 00:54:52.539
- so I--
- Okay.

00:54:52.623 --> 00:54:54.082
- And?
- Pardon?

00:54:54.166 --> 00:54:57.503
Who are you to give a task
to my associate and yell at him?

00:55:01.423 --> 00:55:04.551
This place isn't a free shelter.
He's acting like a salary thief--

00:55:04.635 --> 00:55:05.552
What?

00:55:06.094 --> 00:55:06.970
Salary thief?

00:55:07.054 --> 00:55:08.680
Yes, salary thief.

00:55:08.764 --> 00:55:11.725
You really are damn rude.

00:55:12.309 --> 00:55:13.811
What I mean is…

00:55:14.812 --> 00:55:15.813
What's going on?

00:55:20.359 --> 00:55:22.778
Who said he could assign work
to my associate?

00:55:22.861 --> 00:55:25.155
Did you say it was okay to do so?

00:55:25.239 --> 00:55:26.156
Yes.

00:55:27.491 --> 00:55:30.536
Associates without enough billable hours
can be shared between teams.

00:55:30.619 --> 00:55:31.745
Says who?

00:55:31.829 --> 00:55:33.163
The relevant committee says so.

00:55:34.414 --> 00:55:37.459
No wonder he doesn't know.
He's always out playing golf.

00:55:37.543 --> 00:55:40.796
That gives you the right to treat
associates with low hours like this?

00:55:40.879 --> 00:55:41.880
Yes.

00:55:41.964 --> 00:55:44.842
I can't keep enabling a salary thief.

00:55:45.467 --> 00:55:46.718
Did you two set this up?

00:55:47.344 --> 00:55:50.347
There's no excuse
for that kind of verbal attack.

00:55:50.430 --> 00:55:53.934
Using phrases like "salary thief"
is just plain disrespectful.

00:55:54.017 --> 00:55:55.978
It's your behavior that creates

00:55:56.520 --> 00:55:59.690
the perfect environment
for parasites like that to thrive.

00:56:00.190 --> 00:56:02.484
I can smell the rot of corruption
coming from you.

00:56:03.402 --> 00:56:06.530
I'm worried
it might affect my associates too.

00:56:07.197 --> 00:56:09.700
That's some strong language you're using.

00:56:10.450 --> 00:56:13.871
You clearly don't know
whose son Na Dong-su is.

00:56:13.954 --> 00:56:15.873
Can you handle the consequences?

00:56:16.832 --> 00:56:20.919
Let's base our sales on actual competence.

00:56:21.003 --> 00:56:23.005
And stop dragging in
a bunch of salary thieves.

00:56:24.214 --> 00:56:25.465
Yoon Seok-hoon!

00:56:39.104 --> 00:56:40.731
How could grinders like you

00:56:40.814 --> 00:56:44.401
ever understand
how rainmakers like us feel, right?

00:56:44.484 --> 00:56:47.487
That's why you'll never
be anything more than a grinder.

00:56:51.825 --> 00:56:52.910
Who is that?

00:56:54.077 --> 00:56:54.995
Ko Tae-seop?

00:56:55.495 --> 00:56:56.413
Don't you know?

00:56:56.496 --> 00:56:58.457
He's the son of a named partner.

00:56:58.540 --> 00:57:01.793
- Which one?
- What's the English name of Yullim?

00:57:01.877 --> 00:57:04.046
Shin, Ko & Kim.

00:57:05.088 --> 00:57:07.883
Exactly. He's the son of "Ko."

00:57:07.966 --> 00:57:10.677
Right, Attorney Ko Seung-cheol.

00:57:11.428 --> 00:57:13.096
What do "grinder" and "rainmaker" mean?

00:57:14.431 --> 00:57:16.850
Rainmakers are attorneys
in sales positions

00:57:16.934 --> 00:57:19.561
who bring in new cases.

00:57:19.645 --> 00:57:21.647
And grinders are the attorneys

00:57:21.730 --> 00:57:23.607
who handle the cases brought in by others.

00:57:25.275 --> 00:57:28.403
When you come
from a good family like Mr. Na,

00:57:28.487 --> 00:57:30.489
just existing is enough to earn respect.

00:57:31.114 --> 00:57:32.824
You wouldn't know that, would you?

00:57:33.533 --> 00:57:34.534
Right.

00:57:35.452 --> 00:57:37.120
So that's what rainmaker means?

00:57:37.204 --> 00:57:39.665
Hijacking companies that came to us
for our competence,

00:57:39.748 --> 00:57:41.333
slapping your name on the deal

00:57:41.416 --> 00:57:44.086
just because
you have an acquaintance there,

00:57:44.169 --> 00:57:48.048
and landing contracts
by dragging in salary thieves?

00:57:48.131 --> 00:57:49.132
Watch what you say.

00:57:49.216 --> 00:57:50.384
You little…

00:57:50.467 --> 00:57:51.760
Don't get worked up.

00:57:52.260 --> 00:57:54.262
- That only means you admit it.
- How dare you--

00:57:54.346 --> 00:57:55.681
Let me.

00:57:57.015 --> 00:58:00.560
Do you think your competence
is your power?

00:58:00.644 --> 00:58:02.938
Don't get cocky just because you're good.

00:58:03.647 --> 00:58:06.024
It's not that big a deal.

00:58:06.108 --> 00:58:07.567
You could end up like your mentor.

00:58:07.651 --> 00:58:09.403
Do you want me to send you

00:58:09.486 --> 00:58:11.738
to a small company
as their in-house counsel?

00:58:13.991 --> 00:58:15.534
A lot of people are watching.

00:58:16.159 --> 00:58:17.744
So are you admitting it publicly?

00:58:17.828 --> 00:58:18.745
Admit what?

00:58:22.457 --> 00:58:23.959
That you schemed to have

00:58:24.751 --> 00:58:27.963
Attorney Kwon Na-yeon
pushed out to a small company

00:58:28.505 --> 00:58:30.257
as their in-house counsel?

00:58:35.512 --> 00:58:38.181
Attorney Kwon Na-yeon?

00:58:38.932 --> 00:58:41.309
The one who won
the Legal Award two years ago?

00:58:41.393 --> 00:58:42.310
Yes.

00:58:42.394 --> 00:58:44.271
Kwon Na-yeon.

00:58:44.771 --> 00:58:46.356
Her name itself is a brand.

00:58:50.318 --> 00:58:51.361
Jeez.

00:58:52.195 --> 00:58:53.196
What an arrogant prick.

00:58:53.280 --> 00:58:55.615
Are you seriously
letting him act that way?

00:58:55.699 --> 00:58:56.658
Of course not.

00:58:57.409 --> 00:58:59.244
I need to show him who's backing me.

00:58:59.995 --> 00:59:00.912
That jerk.

00:59:10.505 --> 00:59:12.174
You're representing Hansu Marine

00:59:12.257 --> 00:59:15.761
in an international arbitration case
against the global energy company Mobiler.

00:59:15.844 --> 00:59:19.306
{\an8}In cross-border deals, arbitration is
often preferred over litigation nowadays.

00:59:19.389 --> 00:59:20.265
{\an8}KWON NA-YEON

00:59:20.348 --> 00:59:22.184
What is the reason for that?

00:59:22.267 --> 00:59:25.228
Companies prefer
arbitration over litigation

00:59:25.312 --> 00:59:27.230
because it's private, faster,

00:59:27.314 --> 00:59:30.067
and offers more procedural flexibility.

00:59:30.150 --> 00:59:32.527
It's also easier
to enforce internationally,

00:59:32.611 --> 00:59:34.821
and the rulings are final and binding.

00:59:35.322 --> 00:59:36.364
{\an8}I see.

00:59:36.448 --> 00:59:38.033
{\an8}I guess this case could be

00:59:38.116 --> 00:59:41.328
{\an8}a great reference
for Yullim Law Firm as well.

00:59:41.411 --> 00:59:43.789
How was it received internally?

01:00:00.263 --> 01:00:01.306
Hey, Seol-a.

01:00:01.389 --> 01:00:03.183
I'm swamped with work now.

01:00:03.266 --> 01:00:05.769
My friend is going on
a blind date with a lawyer.

01:00:06.353 --> 01:00:08.313
She knows you're
my roommate and a lawyer,

01:00:08.396 --> 01:00:10.357
so she asked me to check his reputation.

01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:12.317
Fine. Give me his name.

01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:14.277
I'll ask around after I finish work.

01:00:14.361 --> 01:00:15.779
Well, it's…

01:00:17.197 --> 01:00:18.281
Out with it.

01:00:18.365 --> 01:00:19.616
I have an urgent task--

01:00:19.699 --> 01:00:21.868
It's Han Seong-chan
from Lee & Seo Law Firm.

01:00:23.829 --> 01:00:26.206
She's going on a blind date
with Han Seong-chan.

01:00:27.874 --> 01:00:28.750
What?

01:00:42.305 --> 01:00:46.601
I wish there were a copyright
on the word "love"

01:00:47.310 --> 01:00:50.814
so people like you
wouldn't be able to use it carelessly.

01:00:56.278 --> 01:00:57.821
Let's talk for a minute.

01:01:01.032 --> 01:01:05.328
You. Good luck dating him.

01:01:05.412 --> 01:01:08.290
He's an asshole.

01:01:13.503 --> 01:01:15.630
Who is that hearing-impaired woman?

01:01:15.714 --> 01:01:17.215
Do you know her?

01:02:10.769 --> 01:02:12.103
Can I use the hot water?

01:02:14.856 --> 01:02:16.483
I asked if I could use the hot water.

01:02:16.566 --> 01:02:17.442
Sure.

01:02:19.444 --> 01:02:20.779
What are you doing at this hour?

01:02:20.862 --> 01:02:22.072
Any urgent work?

01:02:22.155 --> 01:02:24.032
The Sammun Construction
unjust enrichment brief

01:02:24.115 --> 01:02:26.159
is due tomorrow morning.

01:02:30.205 --> 01:02:31.414
Would you like some tea?

01:02:35.502 --> 01:02:37.170
Yes, please.

01:02:37.254 --> 01:02:38.129
Thank you.

01:02:55.981 --> 01:03:00.402
Mr. Park Gi-beom is a great guy.

01:03:02.696 --> 01:03:07.200
I hope they live happily ever after.

01:03:15.458 --> 01:03:20.338
How would you feel
if you were in that situation?

01:03:24.968 --> 01:03:26.386
Mr. Park's wife…

01:03:30.515 --> 01:03:31.766
How would I feel

01:03:31.850 --> 01:03:34.978
if my partner suffered
burns on her face and all over her body?

01:03:35.061 --> 01:03:36.229
Yes.

01:03:38.773 --> 01:03:40.692
I'd go nuts from heartbreak.

01:03:44.195 --> 01:03:45.405
Would you turn away from her?

01:03:48.658 --> 01:03:51.828
When the looks or circumstances
of your loved one change,

01:03:53.079 --> 01:03:54.873
your love changes as well.

01:03:59.002 --> 01:04:00.420
Do you honestly believe that?

01:04:01.046 --> 01:04:02.505
I hope that's not the case,

01:04:04.299 --> 01:04:05.425
but I get it.

01:04:12.349 --> 01:04:14.017
I'd love to say that's not true,

01:04:15.769 --> 01:04:17.145
but I'm not sure either.

01:04:17.771 --> 01:04:18.730
There are things

01:04:18.813 --> 01:04:22.442
you can only understand when you're
faced with such extreme situations.

01:04:24.319 --> 01:04:25.362
But you see,

01:04:26.863 --> 01:04:29.532
when the person you love is in crisis

01:04:30.033 --> 01:04:31.659
and you walk away,

01:04:32.452 --> 01:04:35.372
it's not about love anymore.
It just makes you a disloyal bastard.

01:04:43.088 --> 01:04:44.422
I guess you're right.

01:04:52.639 --> 01:04:53.890
Let's get going.

01:04:57.060 --> 01:04:58.520
Thank you for the tea.

01:05:04.651 --> 01:05:06.069
About Mr. Park's case…

01:05:06.152 --> 01:05:07.028
Yes?

01:05:10.073 --> 01:05:11.116
You did well.

01:05:12.033 --> 01:05:12.992
Thank you.

01:06:03.877 --> 01:06:06.963
BEYOND THE BAR

01:06:09.757 --> 01:06:11.968
{\an8}His mother filed
a civil and criminal lawsuit

01:06:12.051 --> 01:06:14.095
{\an8}against the delivery company and driver.

01:06:14.179 --> 01:06:15.889
{\an8}So, the plaintiff's doctor claims

01:06:15.972 --> 01:06:18.558
{\an8}the plaintiff shows symptoms
consistent with a collision,

01:06:18.641 --> 01:06:21.811
{\an8}despite the fact
that the delivery truck in question

01:06:21.895 --> 01:06:23.062
{\an8}made no physical contact.

01:06:23.146 --> 01:06:25.857
{\an8}No collision, but the injuries
are consistent with one?

01:06:25.940 --> 01:06:27.192
{\an8}Is that even possible?

01:06:27.275 --> 01:06:29.027
{\an8}Did you have to say all that?

01:06:29.110 --> 01:06:31.070
{\an8}You acted like you wanted to hurt her.

01:06:31.154 --> 01:06:32.030
{\an8}Verbal blows are fine,

01:06:32.113 --> 01:06:33.823
{\an8}but the wrong hit could be fatal.

01:06:33.907 --> 01:06:36.034
{\an8}The truth can be poison
if it's used like one.

01:06:36.117 --> 01:06:37.827
{\an8}Ms. Kang, tread carefully.

01:06:43.166 --> 01:06:45.168
