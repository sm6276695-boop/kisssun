KO SEUNG-CHEOL
MANAGING PARTNER OF YULLIM

00:01:29.548 --> 00:01:33.051
This stop is Seoul. Seoul Station.

00:01:33.135 --> 00:01:35.178
The doors are on your right.

00:02:07.544 --> 00:02:08.712
Can we get the next group?

00:02:15.552 --> 00:02:16.928
- Kim Seo-yeon.
- Here.

00:02:17.012 --> 00:02:18.305
- Lee Dae-hun.
- Here.

00:02:18.388 --> 00:02:19.598
Kang Hyo-min.

00:02:19.681 --> 00:02:21.099
- Sung Jin-myeong.
- Here.

00:02:21.183 --> 00:02:22.851
Please make your way inside.

00:02:25.771 --> 00:02:27.147
Ms. Kang Hyo-min?

00:02:39.785 --> 00:02:42.079
By any chance, did they call out…

00:02:42.162 --> 00:02:43.163
"Kang Hyo-min" yet?

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:45.832
Yes. She did just now.

00:02:47.584 --> 00:02:49.586
It seems Ms. Kang Hyo-min didn't make it.

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:50.587
All right.

00:02:57.928 --> 00:02:59.179
My apologies!

00:03:00.555 --> 00:03:03.517
- What's going on?
- I'm Kang Hyo-min, here for the interview.

00:03:19.241 --> 00:03:20.992
{\an8}TWO HOURS AGO

00:03:21.076 --> 00:03:22.703
{\an8}Darn it…

00:03:36.633 --> 00:03:38.009
You can't even tell now.

00:03:47.561 --> 00:03:48.437
Leave.

00:03:49.688 --> 00:03:50.605
Pardon?

00:03:52.524 --> 00:03:55.068
Attorneys bill their time

00:03:55.152 --> 00:03:58.405
for the work they do
in five-minute increments.

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:01.867
Time management skills are essential
in such a line of work.

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:02.826
Leave.

00:04:06.997 --> 00:04:09.207
There could have been
some sort of emergency.

00:04:09.833 --> 00:04:11.585
Can you tell us why you were late?

00:04:12.586 --> 00:04:14.588
I was reading a book on the subway…

00:04:18.008 --> 00:04:20.177
and missed my stop.

00:04:22.679 --> 00:04:24.389
I appreciate the honesty,

00:04:25.223 --> 00:04:28.518
but I do not believe your excuse
is valid enough for me to lend a hand.

00:04:29.436 --> 00:04:30.604
Please show her out

00:04:30.687 --> 00:04:33.023
and let us resume the interview.

00:04:33.106 --> 00:04:34.024
Yes, sir.

00:04:36.485 --> 00:04:37.527
This way, please.

00:04:45.243 --> 00:04:47.037
I'll be waiting outside.

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.330
Should you change your mind…

00:04:51.249 --> 00:04:52.292
This way.

00:05:02.677 --> 00:05:06.056
Kim Chi-seong, Yoon Yeong-ju,
Hwang Gyun-seong, and Jung Eun-a.

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:08.016
Please come inside.

ENTRY-LEVEL ATTORNEY
INTERVIEW ROOM

00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:24.950
My goodness.

00:05:29.204 --> 00:05:30.372
- Sir.
- Yes?

00:05:30.455 --> 00:05:32.624
You do know
who that late applicant was, right?

00:05:33.542 --> 00:05:34.417
Who?

00:05:34.501 --> 00:05:38.046
She was the winner of the 12th National
Law School Mock Trials.

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:39.840
That was her?

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:42.717
Meritocracy.

00:05:42.801 --> 00:05:44.052
{\an8}It is an inherently fair system.

00:05:44.135 --> 00:05:46.596
{\an8}MERITOCRACY: A SYSTEM WHERE
STATUS AND REWARDS DEPEND ON MERIT

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.182
{\an8}One should succeed if they got into SNU
through skills and effort.

00:05:49.266 --> 00:05:51.852
This is a universally accepted truth
and is considered common sense.

00:05:51.935 --> 00:05:55.272
However, for meritocracy
to be fair and just, there must be…

00:05:56.314 --> 00:05:58.733
There must be
one starting point for everybody.

00:05:59.234 --> 00:06:00.610
Without equal starting points,

00:06:00.694 --> 00:06:03.405
it is no longer
an impartial system based on merit

00:06:03.488 --> 00:06:05.949
but the perpetuation of inherited elitism.

00:06:09.411 --> 00:06:10.704
I'm sure some of you here

00:06:10.787 --> 00:06:14.457
think lightly of the case before you.

00:06:15.458 --> 00:06:16.710
You may wonder

00:06:16.793 --> 00:06:19.462
if a prison sentence is too extreme
for a high school teacher

00:06:19.546 --> 00:06:21.798
who tutored the child
of a wealthy family for a hefty fee.

00:06:21.882 --> 00:06:25.552
However, this teacher's misconduct
compromises the principle of equality

00:06:25.635 --> 00:06:28.722
and the very foundation of our society.

00:06:29.431 --> 00:06:32.601
Are you saying she was the one
who turned down our offer?

00:06:32.684 --> 00:06:34.936
Yes, I hear she is expected
to join Lee & Seo.

00:06:37.272 --> 00:06:40.859
I mean, what do they have that we don't?
Why do we keep losing candidates to them?

00:06:40.942 --> 00:06:42.193
NATIONAL LAW SCHOOL MOCK TRIALS

00:06:42.277 --> 00:06:44.487
We should engage in fair competition.

00:06:44.571 --> 00:06:46.323
We should do so to ensure

00:06:46.406 --> 00:06:49.659
a sweet reward for those
who shed blood, sweat, and tears,

00:06:49.743 --> 00:06:52.579
and disappointment and regret
for those who do not.

00:06:53.455 --> 00:06:57.834
Only then can our society
see progress without regression.

00:06:58.501 --> 00:07:01.588
Such evil as this teacher's misconduct
that inhibits our society's progress

00:07:01.671 --> 00:07:03.298
must be uprooted.

00:07:06.426 --> 00:07:10.889
In turn, the prosecution recommends
a sentence of three years in prison.

00:07:16.353 --> 00:07:17.270
Really?

00:07:18.939 --> 00:07:21.399
- Sir…
- Yes?

00:07:21.483 --> 00:07:23.652
I think we might regret
sending her off like that.

00:07:24.486 --> 00:07:25.487
- Right?
- Yes.

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:29.532
Should we ask to see her
if she's still waiting outside?

00:07:30.075 --> 00:07:32.327
If you'd like.
I've already made up my mind.

00:07:34.996 --> 00:07:35.914
I figured as much.

00:07:35.997 --> 00:07:39.793
You value punctuality above all else.

00:07:41.544 --> 00:07:42.587
But…

00:07:43.213 --> 00:07:46.174
we only have
three candidates in this last group.

00:07:46.257 --> 00:07:50.345
We've done interviews
with groups of four up until now.

00:07:51.096 --> 00:07:53.556
Sure, if that's what you wish,
please have her come in.

00:07:56.518 --> 00:07:57.852
Understood.

00:08:00.605 --> 00:08:03.233
{\an8}EXAMINEE ID

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:06.069
Here is a question for the group.

00:08:07.278 --> 00:08:11.074
A man gets hit by a car
as he crosses the street on a crosswalk.

00:08:11.157 --> 00:08:15.078
He ends up losing his arm in the crash.

00:08:15.161 --> 00:08:18.498
Then, a nearby pedestrian
suddenly grabs the arm and runs.

00:08:18.581 --> 00:08:20.792
To get his arm back,

00:08:20.875 --> 00:08:23.211
he files a complaint for restitution.

00:08:23.294 --> 00:08:25.922
How do you think the court ruled?

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:29.134
It must have been
in favor of the plaintiff.

00:08:29.217 --> 00:08:32.262
- And the reasoning?
- The plaintiff is the owner of the arm.

00:08:32.345 --> 00:08:33.722
It had to be returned.

00:08:34.848 --> 00:08:36.391
How is "owner" defined legally?

00:08:36.474 --> 00:08:37.934
As the person with ownership.

00:08:38.852 --> 00:08:40.603
The plaintiff has ownership over that arm,

00:08:40.687 --> 00:08:42.772
and the defendant
unlawfully took possession.

00:08:42.856 --> 00:08:45.525
Hence, he can file
a complaint for restitution.

00:08:45.608 --> 00:08:46.818
He can win.

00:08:48.778 --> 00:08:50.905
Do the rest of you agree?

00:08:53.408 --> 00:08:54.451
I don't.

00:08:55.368 --> 00:08:58.997
There's a chance the complaint
for restitution could be dismissed.

00:09:00.415 --> 00:09:01.624
And why do you think that?

00:09:01.708 --> 00:09:05.211
Because it's unclear if the plaintiff
is the holder of said ownership.

00:09:05.295 --> 00:09:09.049
If it doesn't belong to the plaintiff,
who does it belong to?

00:09:09.549 --> 00:09:11.760
Isn't this just a matter of common sense?

00:09:13.178 --> 00:09:16.723
I believe legal logic differs
from common sense.

00:09:17.974 --> 00:09:18.933
Please continue.

00:09:19.976 --> 00:09:23.688
If the law recognizes body parts
as subject to ownership,

00:09:23.772 --> 00:09:26.107
then it must also permit
their discretionary disposal,

00:09:26.191 --> 00:09:27.859
including the right to sell them.

00:09:27.942 --> 00:09:30.236
So the right to commit suicide

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:32.697
and sell organs
must also be considered legal.

00:09:33.281 --> 00:09:36.284
However, the law
does not recognize such rights

00:09:36.367 --> 00:09:38.244
when it comes to body parts and life.

00:09:38.328 --> 00:09:41.122
Thus, establishing the grounds
for a complaint based on ownership

00:09:41.206 --> 00:09:42.248
would be difficult.

00:09:44.084 --> 00:09:45.585
If he seeks restitution,

00:09:45.668 --> 00:09:48.088
he will need to identify
another legal ground.

00:09:48.171 --> 00:09:50.882
Here is the next question.

00:09:50.965 --> 00:09:54.761
Mr. Kim is operating a train
carrying 100 passengers.

00:09:54.844 --> 00:09:57.889
However, due to a large boulder
on the tracks ahead,

00:09:57.972 --> 00:09:59.849
a collision is imminent.

00:09:59.933 --> 00:10:01.851
Mr. Kim wishes to flip down
the converter switch

00:10:01.935 --> 00:10:04.604
to divert the train
to the right at the turnout,

00:10:04.687 --> 00:10:06.606
but a technician stands in the way.

00:10:06.689 --> 00:10:10.318
However, without the diversion,
all the passengers on the train will die.

00:10:11.444 --> 00:10:12.904
{\an8}GOING BACK ONE MINUTE

00:10:12.987 --> 00:10:16.533
{\an8}If the switch is flipped,
the train will be diverted to the right,

00:10:16.616 --> 00:10:19.452
and the technician
will be crushed to death by the train.

00:10:19.953 --> 00:10:22.705
In the end, Mr. Kim diverts the train
and saves the 100 passengers.

00:10:22.789 --> 00:10:26.042
However, the technician
gets crushed to death by the train.

00:10:26.709 --> 00:10:30.755
Then, would Mr. Kim's conduct
constitute murder?

00:10:31.297 --> 00:10:33.967
No, it would not constitute murder.

00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:35.218
I believe that as well.

00:10:35.301 --> 00:10:38.346
He had to make that choice
to save the majority.

00:10:39.931 --> 00:10:41.599
It would constitute murder.

00:10:43.017 --> 00:10:43.893
How so?

00:10:43.977 --> 00:10:46.896
Because all the statutory elements
constituting the crime have been met.

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:49.107
The act of flipping the switch
was intentional,

00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:51.025
and the technician died as a result.

00:10:51.109 --> 00:10:53.695
Mr. Kim was aware
that the technician would die,

00:10:53.778 --> 00:10:56.531
but he still proceeded.
Hence, it would constitute murder.

00:10:57.282 --> 00:11:01.161
Are you saying he must be sentenced
for murder even after saving 100 lives?

00:11:02.745 --> 00:11:04.164
Would that be justice?

00:11:05.373 --> 00:11:07.667
I did not say he should be sentenced.

00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:10.378
The question asked
if it constituted murder,

00:11:11.004 --> 00:11:13.464
and all the statutory elements
constituting the crime were met.

00:11:13.548 --> 00:11:16.384
Hence, my answer is yes.
It does constitute murder.

00:11:16.467 --> 00:11:19.304
However, if the court recognizes
grounds for justification,

00:11:19.387 --> 00:11:20.972
he may be acquitted.

00:11:22.807 --> 00:11:24.684
Even an act that is morally right

00:11:24.767 --> 00:11:27.312
can become a crime
if the statutory elements are fulfilled.

00:11:27.395 --> 00:11:30.106
Conversely, an immoral act
can avoid being a crime

00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:33.151
if the statutory elements aren't met.

00:11:33.234 --> 00:11:36.279
The law is not perfect.

00:11:36.905 --> 00:11:40.116
Moral standards and legal standards
do not always align.

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:43.494
That is the constant struggle
for legal practitioners.

00:11:49.292 --> 00:11:51.377
INDUCTION

00:11:51.461 --> 00:11:53.880
AN INTRODUCTORY SESSION FOR NEW HIRES

00:11:55.924 --> 00:11:57.091
LYRICIST OF THE YEAR

00:11:57.175 --> 00:11:59.469
{\an8}Why isn't she coming out?

00:11:59.552 --> 00:12:01.137
Did her interview go well?

00:12:04.766 --> 00:12:06.100
How did it go?

00:12:07.977 --> 00:12:08.895
Well,

00:12:08.978 --> 00:12:11.064
- I bombed it.
- How?

00:12:11.147 --> 00:12:14.400
I left an hour early
to catch the subway so I wouldn't be late.

00:12:14.484 --> 00:12:17.028
But the man sitting next to me
rushed out and left…

00:12:17.737 --> 00:12:19.239
a book, and reading it…

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:21.824
made me late.

00:12:22.825 --> 00:12:23.826
You're killing me.

00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:25.245
Again?

00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:27.330
I'm pretty sure you're the only one

00:12:27.413 --> 00:12:30.041
who had an early offer
from Lee & Seo withdrawn due to tardiness.

00:12:30.124 --> 00:12:33.169
That's why I left a whole hour early
to make sure I wasn't late.

00:12:33.253 --> 00:12:36.673
What difference does that make?
You were still late in the end.

00:12:36.756 --> 00:12:38.383
Whatever. I guess it wasn't meant to be.

00:12:38.466 --> 00:12:39.550
Moron.

00:12:40.134 --> 00:12:41.427
But still, cut her some slack.

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:44.889
What's she going to do?

00:12:44.973 --> 00:12:47.308
Hello, I'm reaching out
from Yullim Law Firm.

00:12:47.392 --> 00:12:49.560
We are pleased to inform you
that you have passed

00:12:49.644 --> 00:12:51.688
the entry-level attorney
recruitment process.

00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:55.692
What's wrong with her?

00:12:55.775 --> 00:12:57.527
- I did it.
- What?

00:12:58.152 --> 00:12:59.153
Yullim!

00:12:59.737 --> 00:13:00.863
I passed!

00:13:00.947 --> 00:13:03.241
- What? You passed?
- She got in?

00:13:03.324 --> 00:13:04.534
- That's amazing.
- No way.

00:13:05.285 --> 00:13:07.370
That's so amazing!

00:13:16.963 --> 00:13:20.341
2025 YULLIM LAW FIRM
ENTRY-LEVEL ATTORNEY INDUCTION

00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:32.186
LEE JIN-WOO

00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:33.855
HEO MIN-JEONG

00:13:44.324 --> 00:13:46.242
Wait. Kang Hyo-min.

00:13:46.784 --> 00:13:48.077
What are you doing here?

00:13:48.161 --> 00:13:49.495
Shouldn't you be at Lee & Seo?

00:13:49.579 --> 00:13:50.538
It just happened.

00:13:50.621 --> 00:13:52.498
How come? You messed up, didn't you?

00:13:54.667 --> 00:13:59.422
Anyway, that makes us
college classmates and colleagues.

00:14:00.048 --> 00:14:01.966
I guess we share a special connection.

00:14:03.176 --> 00:14:04.969
- What's wrong with you?
- Now, we will begin

00:14:05.053 --> 00:14:07.764
the introduction of Yullim's
new entry-level attorneys

00:14:07.847 --> 00:14:09.932
and the induction ceremony.

00:14:10.433 --> 00:14:12.435
Can we have
the new attorneys step forward?

00:14:12.518 --> 00:14:13.561
Yes, ma'am!

00:14:20.234 --> 00:14:21.361
Hello.

00:14:21.444 --> 00:14:22.320
NEWCOMER SELF-INTROS

00:14:22.403 --> 00:14:26.157
My name is Oh Sang-cheol,
and I currently reside in Cheongdam-dong.

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:29.660
I will strive to be the most perfect
version of Oh Sang-cheol I can be,

00:14:29.744 --> 00:14:32.830
who is not only young and rich
but also smart. Thank you.

00:14:33.748 --> 00:14:35.541
Yullim. At your service!

00:14:36.501 --> 00:14:37.543
Hello.

00:14:37.627 --> 00:14:39.170
I am Ji Guk-hyeon, a 14th-class attorney

00:14:39.253 --> 00:14:41.297
and an alumnus of SNU Law School.

00:14:41.381 --> 00:14:43.883
I love to rap, so here's a verse
to express my determination and…

00:14:43.966 --> 00:14:46.803
- Nervous?
- Yes, very.

00:14:48.554 --> 00:14:52.266
Surely, we won't have zero applicants
for our team again this year.

00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:53.559
Jeez…

00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:55.436
There must be someone.

00:14:57.355 --> 00:14:59.273
What did Mr. Yoon say?

00:14:59.357 --> 00:15:01.317
"The right one always finds their way."

00:15:01.984 --> 00:15:04.404
I hope he's at least nice
in his speech later.

00:15:04.487 --> 00:15:05.822
Do you like any of them?

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:09.409
- That one over there.
- Who?

00:15:10.159 --> 00:15:12.912
Kang Hyo-min,
first in her class at SNU Law School.

00:15:12.995 --> 00:15:14.288
I see…

00:15:14.372 --> 00:15:17.875
As a colleague,
I won't ask you to go easy on me.

00:15:18.584 --> 00:15:22.380
Instead, I will prove my value
through my effort and skills.

00:15:23.005 --> 00:15:25.842
My name is Choi Ho-yeon,
and I promise to give it my all.

00:15:31.681 --> 00:15:32.974
Hello.

00:15:33.057 --> 00:15:36.769
I am Kang Hyo-min,
14th-class attorney and SNU Law alumna.

00:15:36.853 --> 00:15:39.689
I will do my best to learn all that I can
from my senior colleagues

00:15:39.772 --> 00:15:41.399
to ensure I become a lawyer of principle

00:15:41.482 --> 00:15:43.317
for the sake of justice in Korea.

00:15:43.401 --> 00:15:44.277
Thank you.

00:15:48.948 --> 00:15:50.950
That's Kang Hyo-min.

00:15:51.033 --> 00:15:53.536
We at Financial Law
already called dibs on her.

00:15:54.287 --> 00:15:55.246
Who cares about dibs?

00:15:55.329 --> 00:15:58.291
We, the corporate law team,
will be her first choice anyway.

00:15:58.374 --> 00:16:00.209
What's with that confidence?

00:16:00.293 --> 00:16:04.130
Now, we will have the heads
of each team introduce their teams.

00:16:04.213 --> 00:16:05.256
After the introductions,

00:16:05.339 --> 00:16:08.092
the new entry-level attorneys
will choose their preferred teams.

00:16:08.176 --> 00:16:10.678
If the number of applicants
exceeds the quota for a team,

00:16:10.761 --> 00:16:13.806
the HR Committee will assign the teams.

00:16:14.515 --> 00:16:17.143
Can we have the heads of each team
step up to the podium?

00:16:19.604 --> 00:16:24.150
TEAM INTROS

00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:34.452
Our corporate law team
is undisputedly comprised

00:16:34.535 --> 00:16:37.163
of the best M&A attorneys in Korea.

00:16:37.246 --> 00:16:41.083
Our team is led by the belief
that a law firm is about the people in it,

00:16:41.167 --> 00:16:43.336
and we make every effort to ensure

00:16:43.419 --> 00:16:45.838
our new recruits shine. And we especially…

00:16:45.922 --> 00:16:47.423
Our antitrust law team…

00:16:48.049 --> 00:16:50.843
You know that when sales take off,
they skyrocket, right?

00:16:50.927 --> 00:16:53.679
As a result, our new recruits
will probably receive

00:16:53.763 --> 00:16:55.515
the highest performance bonuses.

00:16:55.598 --> 00:16:57.475
So what if they're high?

00:16:57.558 --> 00:16:59.101
Work-life balance matters.

00:16:59.185 --> 00:17:01.771
What good is a lot of money
without time to use it?

00:17:02.271 --> 00:17:05.816
Our financial law team is known
for fostering excellent work-life balance.

00:17:06.484 --> 00:17:07.527
Hello.

00:17:08.069 --> 00:17:11.405
I am Yoon Seok-hoon, a partner
and the head of the litigation team.

00:17:14.909 --> 00:17:16.911
In Litigation, a work-life balance is…

00:17:17.578 --> 00:17:19.497
Please…

00:17:20.122 --> 00:17:21.165
…a luxury we can't afford.

00:17:21.249 --> 00:17:22.375
Damn it.

00:17:23.084 --> 00:17:26.629
As a first-year attorney, your day starts
in the morning and ends at dawn.

00:17:27.255 --> 00:17:29.799
If you perform all your given tasks well,

00:17:29.882 --> 00:17:31.384
can you leave on time? Sure.

00:17:31.467 --> 00:17:33.970
But will that be feasible
for a first-year?

00:17:34.053 --> 00:17:35.721
You need time to stumble and slip up.

00:17:36.389 --> 00:17:38.849
Performance bonus? I'm not sure.

00:17:39.725 --> 00:17:41.686
What could a first-year know how to do?

00:17:42.562 --> 00:17:45.106
You can't tell your ass
from your elbow at first.

00:17:47.775 --> 00:17:50.611
He just made sure
no one picks Litigation again this year.

00:17:57.410 --> 00:18:00.538
All right, we'll now proceed
with the Q&A portion.

00:18:01.622 --> 00:18:02.707
Yes?

00:18:07.712 --> 00:18:09.922
In-house corporate lawyers

00:18:10.006 --> 00:18:12.508
are offered flexible hours
and excellent benefits.

00:18:13.217 --> 00:18:15.511
Now, their salaries are comparable
to those at law firms.

00:18:15.595 --> 00:18:17.388
Even if there is a notable difference,

00:18:17.471 --> 00:18:19.432
I believe quality of life
is more important.

00:18:19.515 --> 00:18:22.685
Could you go into further details

00:18:22.768 --> 00:18:25.521
about each team's
flexible work policies or benefits?

00:18:25.605 --> 00:18:29.191
All of you must be stressed out
about family events these days.

00:18:29.275 --> 00:18:34.196
Our team independently provides
support for all major family events.

00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:36.198
As you know, Yullim sponsors

00:18:36.282 --> 00:18:39.118
its fifth and sixth-years to study abroad.

00:18:39.201 --> 00:18:42.997
Unfortunately, we can't send everyone.
We only pick the top associates to go.

00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:45.291
However, associates
of our antitrust law team

00:18:46.125 --> 00:18:48.794
have all made the cut,
every single one of them.

00:18:49.378 --> 00:18:51.380
Why? Because we bring in solid revenue.

00:18:51.464 --> 00:18:52.798
Our financial law team

00:18:52.882 --> 00:18:55.593
has implemented a policy
that permits a weekly work-from-home day.

00:18:56.594 --> 00:18:58.971
Does the litigation team offer anything?

00:18:59.055 --> 00:19:00.014
Please, say we do.

00:19:00.097 --> 00:19:01.515
"As for all the benefits mentioned,

00:19:01.599 --> 00:19:04.602
we're working on an internal plan
to roll out early next year." Say it.

00:19:04.685 --> 00:19:06.103
We have none.

00:19:07.355 --> 00:19:08.981
If you struggle with time management,

00:19:09.523 --> 00:19:10.608
don't apply to this team.

00:19:11.817 --> 00:19:12.902
And one last thing.

00:19:14.028 --> 00:19:15.655
Since no one asked about it,

00:19:15.738 --> 00:19:18.199
I assume you have yet to review
the details of your contracts.

00:19:18.282 --> 00:19:19.700
Not all of you here

00:19:19.784 --> 00:19:22.536
are guaranteed to become
associates at this firm.

00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:25.915
After the probationary period,
performance reviews will determine

00:19:25.998 --> 00:19:27.750
exactly which half of you stays.

00:19:27.833 --> 00:19:30.753
In other words,
at the end of the probationary period,

00:19:30.836 --> 00:19:32.338
one stays, and one is out.

00:19:33.839 --> 00:19:36.217
- Half of us won't make it?
- Jeez…

00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:37.718
So, the rumors were true.

00:19:37.802 --> 00:19:40.054
They'll make us compete for survival.

00:19:40.137 --> 00:19:41.764
That's what they all do now.

00:19:42.473 --> 00:19:44.684
What choice do we have?
We just have to accept it

00:19:44.767 --> 00:19:46.394
with 30,000 lawyers in the race.

00:19:48.062 --> 00:19:49.480
Which team is your first pick?

00:19:49.563 --> 00:19:51.023
I haven't decided yet.

00:19:51.107 --> 00:19:53.067
But it'll definitely not be Litigation.

00:19:53.859 --> 00:19:55.361
Totally. Not mine either.

00:19:58.489 --> 00:19:59.990
{\an8}LABOR, FINANCIAL,
CRIMINAL, CORPORATE

00:20:00.074 --> 00:20:01.784
{\an8}TAX, LITIGATION,
ANTITRUST, MARITIME, ENERGY

00:20:01.867 --> 00:20:03.119
TEAM SELECTION
FOUR MAX PER TEAM

00:20:03.202 --> 00:20:06.247
IF THE QUOTA IS EXCEEDED
THE HR COMMITTEE WILL ASSIGN THE TEAMS

00:20:06.330 --> 00:20:07.498
The entry-level attorneys

00:20:07.581 --> 00:20:11.502
may now stand in front
of the team they most wish to join.

00:20:11.585 --> 00:20:12.545
Yes, ma'am.

00:20:18.592 --> 00:20:21.011
YULLIM WELCOMES ALL NEW LAWYERS
LET'S MAKE OUR DREAMS COME TRUE

00:20:21.095 --> 00:20:24.640
Please be aware
that each team has four slots available.

00:20:24.724 --> 00:20:26.267
CORPORATE, TAX, LITIGATION, ANTITRUST

00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:40.114
LITIGATION

00:21:03.471 --> 00:21:04.472
Hyo-min.

00:21:05.055 --> 00:21:05.931
Hey.

00:21:13.439 --> 00:21:16.484
{\an8}LITIGATION

00:21:44.845 --> 00:21:46.055
Take care.

00:21:46.806 --> 00:21:48.265
Why not? Tell me.

00:21:48.349 --> 00:21:51.435
Why are you turning away
a blessing that's fallen into our laps?

00:21:52.812 --> 00:21:53.687
Bro!

00:21:54.313 --> 00:21:56.148
I told you, no "bro" card
during business hours.

00:21:56.232 --> 00:21:58.734
I get it. She was late,
and you take punctuality seriously.

00:21:58.818 --> 00:22:00.736
But you said it was just two minutes.

00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:04.990
I hear her early offer from Lee & Seo
was withdrawn because she didn't show up.

00:22:05.074 --> 00:22:07.451
That is why she fell right into our hands.

00:22:07.535 --> 00:22:08.786
Her phone was cracked,

00:22:08.869 --> 00:22:11.539
the stain on her shirt was
sloppily covered with correction fluid,

00:22:11.622 --> 00:22:12.873
and her shoes were scuffed.

00:22:14.542 --> 00:22:15.459
Fine.

00:22:15.543 --> 00:22:18.587
I'll be generous and say
she is not the most put-together.

00:22:18.671 --> 00:22:21.423
But that shouldn't determine
her professional competence.

00:22:21.507 --> 00:22:23.008
It's about preparation.

00:22:23.092 --> 00:22:25.803
Choi Hyeon-cheol was also
a top graduate and capable.

00:22:25.886 --> 00:22:27.304
But what good did that do?

00:22:27.388 --> 00:22:30.474
He missed every deadline
and was a no-show at hearings.

00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:33.894
For the lawyer, it just means
a couple months of disciplinary action.

00:22:33.978 --> 00:22:36.230
But what about the client
who suffered for it?

00:22:37.189 --> 00:22:39.400
To them, lawsuits are a last resort.

00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:44.947
Wait, bro. Hold on.

00:22:45.030 --> 00:22:47.032
She was just two minutes late.

00:22:47.116 --> 00:22:48.492
Come on…

00:22:56.166 --> 00:22:57.293
Are you busy?

00:22:57.793 --> 00:22:59.086
Hey. No, come in.

00:22:59.169 --> 00:23:00.045
Okay.

00:23:08.679 --> 00:23:11.849
Can you tell him what you told me earlier?

00:23:12.558 --> 00:23:15.352
Right. I want to be a lawyer to have fun.

00:23:19.565 --> 00:23:21.400
No, that wasn't what I meant.

00:23:22.026 --> 00:23:22.943
Right.

00:23:23.777 --> 00:23:25.779
I really want to join the litigation team.

00:23:26.488 --> 00:23:27.364
Yes, there we go.

00:23:29.033 --> 00:23:30.200
Why? I mean…

00:23:30.284 --> 00:23:32.244
Why did you turn down
all the other great teams?

00:23:32.328 --> 00:23:35.539
This is not even corporate litigation.
It's personal litigation.

00:23:35.623 --> 00:23:37.249
Any great reason why you want to join?

00:23:39.043 --> 00:23:42.421
Love comes in many different shades.

00:23:42.922 --> 00:23:45.716
Heterosexual, homosexual,
maternal, paternal, reverential,

00:23:45.799 --> 00:23:48.969
brotherhood, friendship, camaraderie,
love for humanity, and self-love.

00:23:49.053 --> 00:23:51.347
And that love hurts people.

00:23:52.097 --> 00:23:54.934
Once that wound festers,
they consider legal action.

00:23:55.017 --> 00:23:57.436
At that breaking point,
they believe their last resort,

00:23:57.519 --> 00:24:00.814
the lawsuit, will protect
their happiness and their right to it.

00:24:01.565 --> 00:24:03.901
I want to represent people like that.

00:24:04.735 --> 00:24:06.946
Because it'd be fun?

00:24:09.323 --> 00:24:10.240
Right.

00:24:15.704 --> 00:24:17.498
Am I in? Why didn't he say anything?

00:24:17.581 --> 00:24:20.250
Probably. He's always been
a man of few words.

00:24:20.334 --> 00:24:23.462
He is never one for anecdotes,
chit-chat, side notes, or small talk.

00:24:24.088 --> 00:24:25.214
I can see that.

00:24:25.297 --> 00:24:27.049
Even his appearance is streamlined.

00:24:27.132 --> 00:24:30.761
And he must be
really on top of his hygiene.

00:24:31.345 --> 00:24:32.930
Can a guy even smell that good?

00:24:34.098 --> 00:24:35.057
Maybe not?

00:24:35.557 --> 00:24:36.642
He is quite clean.

00:24:36.725 --> 00:24:38.978
It goes beyond his personality
and appearance.

00:24:39.061 --> 00:24:43.023
Have you ever heard about
the Legendary Associate of Yullim?

00:24:43.524 --> 00:24:44.400
No.

00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:45.901
This first-year at Yullim

00:24:45.985 --> 00:24:48.445
would come in at 9 a.m.
and go home at exactly 6 p.m.

00:24:48.529 --> 00:24:51.740
Not a second earlier or later,
but his tasks were completed flawlessly.

00:24:51.824 --> 00:24:53.784
Come on. You're making that up.

00:24:53.867 --> 00:24:55.744
- That's impossible.
- I'm being serious.

00:24:55.828 --> 00:24:57.287
He irritated this one partner so much,

00:24:57.371 --> 00:24:59.331
he was given
a complaint file this thick to review.

00:24:59.415 --> 00:25:01.333
Enough material for two all-nighters,

00:25:01.417 --> 00:25:02.960
but he left at exactly 6 p.m.

00:25:03.043 --> 00:25:05.671
So when the partner asked him
if he had completed his work,

00:25:05.754 --> 00:25:08.465
he responded with,
"I already emailed it to you," and left.

00:25:08.549 --> 00:25:11.468
Then, the partner
immediately checked his inbox to find…

00:25:12.094 --> 00:25:13.345
What did they find?

00:25:13.429 --> 00:25:16.765
It was concise and to the point
without a single unnecessary word.

00:25:16.849 --> 00:25:19.727
That brief still gets passed around
as the gold standard.

00:25:20.352 --> 00:25:21.937
That's amazing…

00:25:22.021 --> 00:25:23.147
And he was none other than…

00:25:24.189 --> 00:25:25.274
Yoon Seok-hoon?

00:25:34.783 --> 00:25:38.120
KANG HYO-MIN, JI GUK-HYEON
CHOI HO-YEON, OH SANG-CHEOL

00:25:38.203 --> 00:25:39.872
KANG HYO-MIN

00:25:42.082 --> 00:25:46.420
Let me sincerely welcome you
to our litigation team.

00:25:47.046 --> 00:25:51.508
In this group, there's someone
who chose Litigation as their first pick,

00:25:52.009 --> 00:25:54.595
someone who chose it
as their second choice,

00:25:54.678 --> 00:25:57.556
and some who had no choice
because HR chose for them

00:25:57.639 --> 00:25:58.682
to be here, but--

00:25:58.766 --> 00:26:01.393
Litigation was actually going
to be my first choice--

00:26:02.019 --> 00:26:03.604
I'm not that petty.

00:26:03.687 --> 00:26:05.731
Who cares about how you ended up here?

00:26:05.814 --> 00:26:07.107
Is that so important?

00:26:08.567 --> 00:26:10.235
- Is that so?
- Of course.

00:26:11.445 --> 00:26:14.948
Now, this will be your first task.

00:26:15.032 --> 00:26:16.909
Two of these files
are for an advisory case

00:26:16.992 --> 00:26:18.994
regarding shareholder meeting procedures.

00:26:19.078 --> 00:26:21.997
You just need to sit in
on the shareholder meeting tomorrow

00:26:22.081 --> 00:26:23.499
and enjoy the AC.

00:26:24.208 --> 00:26:25.876
The other two files

00:26:25.959 --> 00:26:30.089
concern a site inspection case
at a rural construction site.

00:26:30.172 --> 00:26:33.133
The road ends halfway,
so you'll have to walk to the site

00:26:33.217 --> 00:26:35.803
while carrying these files.

00:26:37.846 --> 00:26:41.350
Now, let's move on
to the long-awaited task assignments.

00:26:41.433 --> 00:26:42.935
Ms. Kang Hyo-min.

00:26:43.769 --> 00:26:46.814
- Yes?
- The Gangdong City Gas advisory case.

00:26:47.439 --> 00:26:49.399
Request a vehicle and head out.

00:26:49.483 --> 00:26:50.484
If you request a vehicle,

00:26:50.567 --> 00:26:53.112
they'll send you a driver
and a spacious car meant for CEOs.

00:26:53.195 --> 00:26:54.738
- Have a safe trip.
- Wow…

00:26:54.822 --> 00:26:56.073
Yes, sir.

00:26:56.156 --> 00:26:57.699
And Mr. Ji Guk-hyeon.

00:26:57.783 --> 00:26:58.784
Yes, sir!

00:26:58.867 --> 00:27:00.953
Sorry, I said the wrong name.

00:27:01.036 --> 00:27:03.080
- Mr. Oh Sang-cheol.
- Yes?

00:27:03.163 --> 00:27:06.250
Mr. Oh Sang-cheol,
who chose our team as his second choice.

00:27:06.333 --> 00:27:07.376
Yes, that is right.

00:27:07.459 --> 00:27:10.003
I was going to choose this team
as my first…

00:27:10.087 --> 00:27:11.797
The Pacific City Gas advisory case.

00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:13.173
Thank you.

00:27:13.257 --> 00:27:15.843
However, you, Mr. Oh,
will take public transportation.

00:27:15.926 --> 00:27:17.219
Yes, sir.

00:27:18.387 --> 00:27:20.681
Mr. Ji Guk-hyeon and Ms. Choi Ho-yeon

00:27:21.431 --> 00:27:23.100
will take on the site inspection case.

00:27:24.601 --> 00:27:25.602
Go on.

00:27:25.686 --> 00:27:26.770
Yes, sir…

00:27:26.854 --> 00:27:28.355
What's with those faces?

00:27:28.438 --> 00:27:29.857
- Right…
- Inside these files,

00:27:29.940 --> 00:27:33.152
you will find detailed instructions.
Be sure to review them well.

00:27:33.235 --> 00:27:36.113
- Yes, sir.
- Now, let us go and say hello.

00:27:36.196 --> 00:27:37.406
Yes, sir.

00:27:37.489 --> 00:27:38.949
Why do you look so down?

00:27:39.032 --> 00:27:40.993
Mind your faces. You should be smiling.

00:27:41.702 --> 00:27:43.162
- Are you that uncomfortable?
- A bit…

00:27:43.245 --> 00:27:44.121
Goodness.

00:27:46.248 --> 00:27:47.875
So much for not caring.

00:27:48.625 --> 00:27:50.085
Must be nice, Hyo-min.

00:27:50.586 --> 00:27:53.463
Kang Hyo-min,
my law school classmate and colleague.

00:27:54.047 --> 00:27:55.465
What's wrong, Ji Guk-hyeon?

00:27:55.549 --> 00:27:57.968
You're someone who thrives
on the sense of accomplishment

00:27:58.051 --> 00:27:59.761
from conquering difficult tasks.

00:27:59.845 --> 00:28:00.846
On that note,

00:28:01.346 --> 00:28:04.391
why don't we switch cases?

00:28:05.309 --> 00:28:07.227
No, thanks. I don't want to.

00:28:08.270 --> 00:28:09.897
Right. Sure.

00:28:10.439 --> 00:28:12.441
I'm sure you don't…

00:28:14.234 --> 00:28:15.402
She's cold as ice.

00:28:18.614 --> 00:28:21.116
THE MEETING OF POWERHOUSE LAWYERS

00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:23.285
KIM YUL-SEONG
HUMAN RIGHTS ADVOCATE

00:28:23.368 --> 00:28:25.370
{\an8}CONGRATULATIONS
MINISTER OF JUSTICE

00:28:30.209 --> 00:28:31.293
Come in.

00:28:31.919 --> 00:28:34.213
Sir, I brought the new hires to say hello.

00:28:34.713 --> 00:28:36.048
Right. Sure.

00:28:40.928 --> 00:28:44.556
This is Attorney Kim Yul-seong,
the division head of the litigation team.

00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:45.974
- Hello, sir.
- Hello, sir.

00:28:46.058 --> 00:28:47.893
Hello. Take a seat.

00:28:52.397 --> 00:28:55.525
- Sit.
- This orchid here…

00:28:55.609 --> 00:28:58.362
Former Minister of Justice
Han Byeong-cheol gave it to me.

00:28:58.445 --> 00:29:00.989
Most orchids live for about eight years.

00:29:01.823 --> 00:29:03.951
But this one has been around
for more than eight years,

00:29:04.034 --> 00:29:06.036
and it still looks quite healthy, no?

00:29:06.119 --> 00:29:09.122
Its lifespan is affected
by the person who takes care of it.

00:29:10.249 --> 00:29:11.500
Listen…

00:29:12.334 --> 00:29:14.336
Do you know what Yullim's English name is?

00:29:14.962 --> 00:29:17.256
I do. It's Shin, Ko & Kim.

00:29:18.257 --> 00:29:20.509
Who do you think "Kim"
of Shin, Ko & Kim could be?

00:29:20.592 --> 00:29:23.053
It is none other than you,
Mr. Kim Yul-seong.

00:29:23.136 --> 00:29:24.554
That's right.

00:29:25.180 --> 00:29:27.891
The fact that you joined a team
with a named partner as division head

00:29:27.975 --> 00:29:30.560
means that you are all as lucky
as this orchid here.

00:29:30.644 --> 00:29:33.355
You joined a good team. Work hard.

00:29:33.438 --> 00:29:34.398
Yes, sir!

00:29:35.023 --> 00:29:36.191
Truth be told,

00:29:36.942 --> 00:29:41.113
when I was younger,
I swam at the same pool as the president.

00:29:45.242 --> 00:29:47.536
I just thought I'd share. That's all.

00:29:52.499 --> 00:29:54.251
- Wow.
- Anyhow…

00:29:55.460 --> 00:29:57.087
Sir, the brief hasn't gone out yet.

00:29:57.796 --> 00:29:59.381
Right. I was just about to send it.

00:29:59.464 --> 00:30:00.882
- You should get going now.
- Yes, sir.

00:30:00.966 --> 00:30:03.218
- Okay.
- Let's go.

00:30:05.762 --> 00:30:08.307
I worked through the night
because you told me it was urgent.

00:30:08.390 --> 00:30:10.392
Why are you still sitting on it?

00:30:10.475 --> 00:30:12.436
Do you think all-nighters
are easy at my age?

00:30:12.519 --> 00:30:14.896
Okay. I hear you.
Why do you keep bringing up your age?

00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:18.859
Who was that graceful attorney
with the aura of a general?

00:30:18.942 --> 00:30:19.901
Is she a partner?

00:30:19.985 --> 00:30:21.945
- Associate. We joined the firm together.
- Pardon?

00:30:22.029 --> 00:30:24.114
She's my colleague,
but she's ten years older than me.

00:30:24.197 --> 00:30:25.574
She looks so young, though.

00:30:25.657 --> 00:30:26.825
- Right?
- Yes.

00:30:26.908 --> 00:30:28.118
But she's still an associate?

00:30:28.201 --> 00:30:30.495
Yeah, a late bloomer.
She became a lawyer right before 40.

00:30:31.163 --> 00:30:34.750
Every law firm has both
a superficial hierarchy and an actual one.

00:30:34.833 --> 00:30:37.627
Mr. Kim Yul-seong
may be the division head on paper,

00:30:37.711 --> 00:30:40.714
but Yoon Seok-hoon
and Heo Min-jeong hold the real power.

00:30:40.797 --> 00:30:43.133
I can understand Mr. Yoon
because he is highly competent.

00:30:43.216 --> 00:30:45.052
But how does an associate have real power?

00:30:45.135 --> 00:30:46.636
Do you know what Mr. Kim is famous for?

00:30:47.304 --> 00:30:49.806
- He's Yullim's founder?
- He is a founder.

00:30:49.890 --> 00:30:51.767
But he is also famous
for his low win rate.

00:30:52.434 --> 00:30:54.227
While Attorneys Shin and Ko

00:30:54.311 --> 00:30:57.189
built up Yullim's reputation
through corporate finance consulting,

00:30:57.272 --> 00:31:00.025
Mr. Kim oversaw litigations
but frequently lost in court.

00:31:00.734 --> 00:31:02.986
Hasn't his win rate
been pretty high recently?

00:31:03.070 --> 00:31:04.905
Correct. It's pretty solid now.

00:31:04.988 --> 00:31:07.282
But who do you think is behind that?

00:31:09.076 --> 00:31:10.202
No way…

00:31:10.285 --> 00:31:12.579
Bingo. It's Heo Min-jeong.

00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:15.749
Can an associate really be that talented?

00:31:15.832 --> 00:31:18.668
That's why she's so confident,
despite being just an associate.

00:31:22.172 --> 00:31:23.173
Let's go.

00:31:41.316 --> 00:31:42.651
Even a newbie shouldn't confuse

00:31:42.734 --> 00:31:44.653
provisional seizure with injunction.

00:31:45.362 --> 00:31:46.655
My apologies, sir.

00:31:47.447 --> 00:31:49.950
Is "my apologies" some kind
of catchphrase for the newbies?

00:31:50.033 --> 00:31:53.203
How has that catchphrase
not gone out of style in ten years?

00:31:54.663 --> 00:31:55.872
…BEARROWED MONEY…

00:32:02.629 --> 00:32:03.630
…REKURN…

00:32:05.632 --> 00:32:08.009
Who wrote up
this complaint for unpaid funds?

00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:10.262
I did…

00:32:11.221 --> 00:32:13.640
It has a clear structure
and solid reasoning,

00:32:13.723 --> 00:32:15.308
but it was the worst brief.

00:32:16.685 --> 00:32:17.602
I found three typos.

00:32:17.686 --> 00:32:20.063
With one, you think, "She's only human."

00:32:20.147 --> 00:32:22.983
With two, you think,
"She must have had a lot on her plate."

00:32:23.066 --> 00:32:25.193
After the third one,
it's a matter of effort.

00:32:25.277 --> 00:32:27.904
Does a small claim mean
the case carries less weight?

00:32:29.573 --> 00:32:32.492
For the client,
one lawsuit could mean everything.

00:32:32.576 --> 00:32:34.953
There's nothing worse
than a half-hearted brief.

00:32:35.495 --> 00:32:37.789
- Do you understand?
- Yes, I'll keep that in mind.

00:32:37.873 --> 00:32:39.166
Next.

00:32:39.249 --> 00:32:42.294
Reference Number 231-73.

00:32:42.377 --> 00:32:43.628
Our client is suing to recover

00:32:43.712 --> 00:32:46.173
the purchase price
already paid to the defendant.

00:32:46.256 --> 00:32:47.507
Who did the brief draft?

00:32:47.591 --> 00:32:48.758
I did, sir.

00:32:49.301 --> 00:32:51.803
Ms. Kang and Mr. Oh
were assigned the case.

00:32:56.558 --> 00:32:58.560
{\an8}CONCLUSION:
AS SUCH, THE DEFENDANT

00:32:58.643 --> 00:33:00.562
{\an8}IS OBLIGATED TO PAY
THE PLAINTIFF AS RESTITUTION…

00:33:01.354 --> 00:33:03.106
- Are you sure this is right?
- Pardon?

00:33:07.652 --> 00:33:08.653
Here.

00:33:09.654 --> 00:33:12.741
"As such, the defendant is obligated
to pay the plaintiff, as restitution,

00:33:12.824 --> 00:33:15.035
the purchase price
under the aforementioned contract

00:33:15.118 --> 00:33:19.498
{\an8}plus interest from the payment date
until full repayment."

00:33:20.248 --> 00:33:21.458
That's what it says here.

00:33:22.375 --> 00:33:23.251
Yes.

00:33:29.007 --> 00:33:29.966
Draft.

00:33:41.186 --> 00:33:42.145
Well done.

00:33:43.647 --> 00:33:44.856
Review and submit this.

00:33:44.940 --> 00:33:46.191
Yes, sir.

00:33:46.274 --> 00:33:47.234
What about mine, sir?

00:33:53.698 --> 00:33:54.741
Read the conclusion.

00:34:01.289 --> 00:34:02.749
"The defendant is obligated to pay

00:34:02.832 --> 00:34:05.126
the purchase price
under the aforementioned contract

00:34:05.210 --> 00:34:07.754
along with delay damages
calculated at an annual rate of 12%

00:34:07.837 --> 00:34:10.590
{\an8}under the Act on Expedition
of Legal Proceedings from the day

00:34:10.674 --> 00:34:14.719
{\an8}after receiving the complaint to the date
of full payment, as unjust enrichment."

00:34:29.067 --> 00:34:29.943
Explain it for us.

00:34:30.026 --> 00:34:31.069
Okay.

00:34:31.570 --> 00:34:34.656
If a contract is terminated,
a duty of restitution arises

00:34:34.739 --> 00:34:36.283
under Article 548 of the Civil Act.

00:34:36.366 --> 00:34:37.993
If a declaration of intent is revoked,

00:34:38.076 --> 00:34:41.955
"duty to return unjust enrichment"
arises under Article 741 of the Civil Act.

00:34:42.038 --> 00:34:44.040
Thus, it would be inaccurate to say

00:34:44.124 --> 00:34:46.376
that cancellation leads
to a duty of restitution.

00:34:46.459 --> 00:34:47.544
Furthermore, the seller

00:34:47.627 --> 00:34:50.130
is not obligated to pay
statutory interest as part of the return.

00:34:50.213 --> 00:34:51.172
Wow…

00:34:56.636 --> 00:34:58.096
If you lack the necessary smarts,

00:34:58.179 --> 00:35:00.849
you should at least
park yourself at a desk

00:35:00.932 --> 00:35:03.560
to review it incessantly
and brainstorm persistently

00:35:03.643 --> 00:35:05.478
before putting anything out.

00:35:05.562 --> 00:35:06.771
My apologies, sir.

00:35:08.648 --> 00:35:10.650
No more "My apologies" from newbies.

00:35:11.276 --> 00:35:13.403
You act like it's some fix-all phrase.

00:35:14.029 --> 00:35:16.615
It's the kind of irresponsible comment
I detest most.

00:35:21.411 --> 00:35:22.287
Next.

00:35:22.370 --> 00:35:24.414
That was the last item on the agenda.

00:35:31.129 --> 00:35:32.213
At Yullim,

00:35:33.048 --> 00:35:34.633
new non-attorney staff members

00:35:34.716 --> 00:35:37.218
are the only ones addressed by name.

00:35:37.302 --> 00:35:40.055
Then do you know why
I address the new attorney hires by name

00:35:40.138 --> 00:35:41.431
and not "Attorney"?

00:35:42.140 --> 00:35:44.017
Does passing the bar exam
make you an attorney?

00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:47.979
Do you contribute any more
than those staff members?

00:35:48.897 --> 00:35:50.607
In the Anglo-American sphere,

00:35:50.690 --> 00:35:53.109
they add "Esq." after attorneys' names.

00:35:57.322 --> 00:36:00.200
It's an honorific used
to convey respect toward attorneys.

00:36:02.786 --> 00:36:06.081
If you wish to be referred to as such,
let's act accordingly.

00:36:06.956 --> 00:36:07.999
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

00:36:16.341 --> 00:36:17.300
Jeez…

00:36:20.887 --> 00:36:27.310
WOOD-FIRED CHICKEN

00:36:47.247 --> 00:36:48.873
Mi-yeon! Seo-yeon!

00:36:48.957 --> 00:36:50.375
- Ho-yeon!
- I'm home!

00:36:51.292 --> 00:36:54.504
You must be so hungry. Guess what this is.

00:36:54.587 --> 00:36:56.881
- Wow, chicken!
- Wow, chicken!

00:36:56.965 --> 00:36:59.300
You must be so cold. Let's rush inside.

00:36:59.384 --> 00:37:02.137
Why did you wait for me outside?

00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:05.056
GANGDONG CITY GAS
BUSINESS PERFORMANCE AND FINANCIAL STATUS

00:37:17.569 --> 00:37:19.696
We'll now move on
to the 2024 business report.

00:37:19.779 --> 00:37:20.655
BUSINESS PERFORMANCE

00:37:20.739 --> 00:37:23.950
City Gas sales volume
was 804 million cubic meters,

00:37:24.033 --> 00:37:26.369
and the revenue was 492.9 billion won.

00:37:26.453 --> 00:37:29.956
We posted a net profit
of 3.1 billion won for the period.

00:37:31.082 --> 00:37:32.333
As you can see…

00:37:35.837 --> 00:37:37.380
COMPREHENSIVE INCOME
CASH FLOW STATEMENT

00:37:38.923 --> 00:37:40.425
That will conclude

00:37:40.508 --> 00:37:43.094
the 42nd annual shareholders' meeting.

00:37:43.178 --> 00:37:44.179
Thank you.

00:37:53.855 --> 00:37:55.398
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

00:37:56.524 --> 00:37:58.276
The revenue for the past ten years…

00:37:59.027 --> 00:38:00.236
What about it?

00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:04.199
In the last seven years,
only Onpyeong's revenue dropped sharply.

00:38:04.282 --> 00:38:05.200
Why is that?

00:38:05.950 --> 00:38:07.577
- Are you a shareholder?
- Well…

00:38:08.995 --> 00:38:11.623
I'm Attorney Kang Hyo-min
from Yullim Law Firm,

00:38:11.706 --> 00:38:13.291
here to advise on the meeting procedure.

00:38:13.374 --> 00:38:14.250
I see.

00:38:15.418 --> 00:38:16.836
But why are you curious about that?

00:38:18.505 --> 00:38:20.632
I just found it a bit strange…

00:38:20.715 --> 00:38:21.674
What exactly?

00:38:22.175 --> 00:38:23.176
Well…

00:38:23.676 --> 00:38:26.179
Forgive me, but was the meeting
mishandled in any way?

00:38:26.262 --> 00:38:27.263
No.

00:38:27.347 --> 00:38:28.598
Then…

00:38:29.933 --> 00:38:32.602
I don't believe
that's a matter you should question.

00:38:33.937 --> 00:38:35.396
Right…

00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:36.606
Please excuse me.

00:38:52.580 --> 00:38:53.998
- Hey.
- Hello, sir.

00:38:54.082 --> 00:38:55.416
The meeting ended,

00:38:55.500 --> 00:38:57.669
but there's something I need to look into.

00:38:57.752 --> 00:38:59.587
- "Look into"?
- Yes.

00:38:59.671 --> 00:39:01.381
So I might return a bit late.

00:39:01.464 --> 00:39:02.590
What are you looking into?

00:39:02.674 --> 00:39:04.801
- Was there a procedure issue?
- No.

00:39:04.884 --> 00:39:07.595
I'll tell you the details
once I've looked into it a bit more.

00:39:12.934 --> 00:39:15.645
ONPYEONG STATION

00:39:15.728 --> 00:39:18.189
Does this bus go
to Onpyeong Hot Spring Village?

00:39:18.273 --> 00:39:20.108
- Yes, it does.
- Okay.

00:39:23.236 --> 00:39:25.071
ONPYEONG HOT SPRING BATHHOUSE

00:39:35.456 --> 00:39:37.876
COLD BATH - OUTDOOR HOT SPRING

00:39:47.218 --> 00:39:49.721
SALT ROOM

00:39:52.891 --> 00:39:55.977
FAR-INFRARED SAUNA BENEFITS

00:40:00.273 --> 00:40:01.566
- That was delicious.
- Good.

00:40:02.901 --> 00:40:03.818
- Ma'am.
- Yes?

00:40:03.902 --> 00:40:05.987
Has this bathhouse been around
for a long time?

00:40:06.070 --> 00:40:07.530
Why? Did something bother you?

00:40:08.156 --> 00:40:09.407
No, it's not that.

00:40:09.490 --> 00:40:11.826
I just felt a sort of traditional vibe.

00:40:11.910 --> 00:40:14.078
Yes, it's been around for 30 years.

00:40:14.162 --> 00:40:16.289
- Is that so?
- Yes.

00:40:16.372 --> 00:40:18.041
This place is open 24 hours, right?

00:40:18.124 --> 00:40:20.752
- Of course.
- Has that been the case the past 30 years?

00:40:20.835 --> 00:40:22.086
Of course.

00:40:38.770 --> 00:40:42.398
Hasn't it been long enough to file
a missing person report at this point?

00:40:43.399 --> 00:40:44.817
I know, right?

00:40:44.901 --> 00:40:47.445
She's probably obsessing over
something again.

00:40:48.071 --> 00:40:49.864
I went to law school with Hyo-min.

00:40:49.948 --> 00:40:51.074
During group projects,

00:40:51.157 --> 00:40:54.869
she'd become fixated on one thing
and obsess over it nonstop for three days.

00:40:54.953 --> 00:40:57.330
If she's absent today, she could be fired.

00:41:04.837 --> 00:41:06.005
Kang Hyo-min!

00:41:06.631 --> 00:41:08.424
- What took you so long?
- What?

00:41:08.508 --> 00:41:09.926
Why is your phone off?

00:41:10.009 --> 00:41:11.594
I couldn't find a place to charge it.

00:41:11.678 --> 00:41:12.929
You are unbelievable.

00:41:13.471 --> 00:41:15.431
- Did you find a new obsession?
- What?

00:41:15.515 --> 00:41:16.683
Ms. Kang!

00:41:18.768 --> 00:41:20.812
Where in the world have you been?

00:41:20.895 --> 00:41:22.981
Wait… did you oversleep?

00:41:23.064 --> 00:41:24.774
You should've at least dried your hair.

00:41:24.857 --> 00:41:26.150
You're in big trouble…

00:41:26.234 --> 00:41:27.527
Run over to Mr. Yoon now.

00:41:27.610 --> 00:41:29.320
Go and apologize. No excuses.

00:41:31.948 --> 00:41:33.032
No, I'll come with you.

00:41:33.116 --> 00:41:34.283
- Here.
- Okay.

00:41:34.367 --> 00:41:35.451
My goodness.

00:41:35.535 --> 00:41:37.328
- Watch what you say…
- What's her deal?

00:41:39.455 --> 00:41:40.331
Come in.

00:41:51.009 --> 00:41:51.884
Speak.

00:41:53.219 --> 00:41:54.637
Ms. Kang clocked in.

00:42:00.935 --> 00:42:01.853
And?

00:42:01.936 --> 00:42:03.646
You were looking for her earlier.

00:42:03.730 --> 00:42:05.398
That was three hours ago.

00:42:07.191 --> 00:42:09.861
The recently hired newbie
with two unexcused absences already

00:42:09.944 --> 00:42:11.779
showed up late today with wet hair…

00:42:12.447 --> 00:42:14.198
I have nothing more to say.

00:42:14.282 --> 00:42:15.742
Well, you see…

00:42:18.494 --> 00:42:19.954
Sorry, sir. I mismanaged her.

00:42:20.538 --> 00:42:21.456
Please, just don't.

00:42:24.250 --> 00:42:28.171
I heard your early offer from Lee & Seo
was withdrawn because of your no-show.

00:42:28.254 --> 00:42:30.006
Well, that was…

00:42:30.631 --> 00:42:33.843
Report the unexcused absences to HR
and have them follow protocol.

00:42:33.926 --> 00:42:35.928
Under Article 4.2 of your contract,

00:42:36.012 --> 00:42:38.306
poor performance
during your probationary period is enough

00:42:38.389 --> 00:42:39.932
for disciplinary dismissal.

00:42:40.016 --> 00:42:42.310
Tell them to start
the disciplinary proceedings.

00:42:42.393 --> 00:42:44.020
- They weren't unexcused.
- Yes, sir.

00:42:44.103 --> 00:42:46.397
You can speak to HR if you need to. Leave.

00:42:47.106 --> 00:42:48.441
- Please…
- I was working off-site.

00:42:49.817 --> 00:42:51.194
- "Working off-site"?
- Yes.

00:42:51.819 --> 00:42:53.446
I attended the Gangdong City Gas meeting…

00:42:53.529 --> 00:42:55.156
And the meeting took a few days?

00:42:55.239 --> 00:42:58.201
No, the shareholders' meeting
ended after a few hours…

00:42:58.284 --> 00:42:59.869
Must I continue to listen to this?

00:42:59.952 --> 00:43:01.370
I apologize, sir. Hurry up.

00:43:02.080 --> 00:43:04.832
Wait… Can't you just hear me out first?

00:43:06.501 --> 00:43:07.919
You're so self-centered.

00:43:08.002 --> 00:43:10.630
From where I stand,
you seem self-centered.

00:43:11.130 --> 00:43:12.924
Aren't we all attorneys here?

00:43:13.007 --> 00:43:15.760
At least let me argue my case
before you give a verdict.

00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:20.389
Two minutes.

00:43:22.350 --> 00:43:24.352
I reviewed the meeting materials

00:43:24.435 --> 00:43:27.814
and noticed that only Onpyeong's revenue
declined sharply in the past seven years.

00:43:27.897 --> 00:43:29.524
- Revenue?
- Yes.

00:43:29.607 --> 00:43:31.943
So I was working off-site
to investigate the issue.

00:43:32.026 --> 00:43:34.570
And why would you investigate that?

00:43:37.031 --> 00:43:38.533
Because it was strange.

00:43:38.616 --> 00:43:39.826
It's a hot spring village,

00:43:39.909 --> 00:43:41.869
and its bathhouses
are the biggest consumers of gas.

00:43:41.953 --> 00:43:45.123
I checked online and discovered
they had been open for 30 years.

00:43:45.957 --> 00:43:47.875
It's odd that there was a decline.

00:43:48.417 --> 00:43:49.836
So I went to investigate in person.

00:43:49.919 --> 00:43:51.003
So, basically…

00:43:52.755 --> 00:43:56.759
not a single employee
at Gangdong City Gas found it odd,

00:43:57.593 --> 00:43:59.720
but you alone found it odd

00:44:00.221 --> 00:44:03.516
and had to skip work
to go investigate that hot spring village?

00:44:03.599 --> 00:44:04.642
Yes.

00:44:05.560 --> 00:44:08.104
I was there to consult
on the meeting procedures,

00:44:08.187 --> 00:44:10.773
but I believe reviewing the actual meeting
is also a part of my job.

00:44:10.857 --> 00:44:14.610
No company hires consulting attorneys
to have them space out at the meeting.

00:44:16.487 --> 00:44:18.281
Yes, that is true.

00:44:18.948 --> 00:44:20.116
Well…

00:44:20.199 --> 00:44:22.118
That is not why clients consult with us.

00:44:22.201 --> 00:44:24.662
So, did you find something
in your investigation?

00:44:24.745 --> 00:44:26.372
I went to the bathhouses in that village

00:44:26.455 --> 00:44:29.584
and discovered they are open
24 hours a day while offering hot baths.

00:44:29.667 --> 00:44:33.045
This is how every bathhouse there
has operated for more than 30 years.

00:44:33.963 --> 00:44:38.009
They were open 24 hours a day
30 years ago and seven years ago,

00:44:38.092 --> 00:44:40.511
but the revenue declined sharply
seven years ago.

00:44:42.305 --> 00:44:43.764
The City Gas bill

00:44:43.848 --> 00:44:47.643
is the basic charge plus
the usage amount times the applicable rate

00:44:47.727 --> 00:44:49.353
times 1.1.

00:44:49.437 --> 00:44:52.064
Usage is the meter reading
times the temp-pressure correction factor.

00:44:52.148 --> 00:44:54.192
- Heat value per unit is--
- Get to the point.

00:44:55.610 --> 00:44:58.321
I believe the usage amounts
were manipulated.

00:45:01.449 --> 00:45:02.783
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

00:45:03.409 --> 00:45:04.827
Do you have the files?

00:45:04.911 --> 00:45:05.828
Yes.

00:45:07.622 --> 00:45:10.416
USAGE-BASED RATE TABLE:
BEFORE, AFTER, CHANGE RATE

00:45:16.756 --> 00:45:19.467
BUSINESS PERFORMANCE: ONPYEONG

00:45:20.676 --> 00:45:22.011
ONPYEONG ACTUAL GAS COST TREND

00:45:22.929 --> 00:45:24.138
{\an8}YEAR 2021, 2022, 2023

00:45:24.222 --> 00:45:25.473
BALANCE SHEET

00:45:25.556 --> 00:45:27.141
Jeez…

00:45:27.225 --> 00:45:28.517
Damn, Kang Hyo-min…

00:45:29.936 --> 00:45:31.896
I think we have enough to notify them.

00:45:32.396 --> 00:45:34.732
Who's our point person
at Gangdong City Gas?

00:45:34.815 --> 00:45:36.317
Assistant Manager Kim Seok-jin.

00:45:37.735 --> 00:45:40.321
- Set up a meeting with a general manager.
- Yes, sir.

00:45:43.282 --> 00:45:46.661
This won't clear
your unexcused absences and tardiness.

00:45:48.287 --> 00:45:49.163
Yes, sir.

00:45:49.247 --> 00:45:51.040
If you act this recklessly again,

00:45:51.540 --> 00:45:52.583
you'll be disciplined.

00:45:54.877 --> 00:45:56.879
Yes. Understood.

00:45:59.799 --> 00:46:03.594
{\an8}COURT

00:46:10.726 --> 00:46:13.312
Are the defendant
and defense counsel present?

00:46:13.854 --> 00:46:16.274
Yes. Attorney Kim Ji-un is present.

00:46:16.357 --> 00:46:17.400
Noted.

00:46:17.942 --> 00:46:19.819
We shall now begin this hearing.

00:46:19.902 --> 00:46:22.655
The counsel for the victim,
Gangdong City Gas,

00:46:22.738 --> 00:46:25.241
Attorney Kang Hyo-min from Yullim,
is also present.

00:46:25.950 --> 00:46:28.869
You might want to set
that bundle down next to you…

00:46:28.953 --> 00:46:29.954
Right.

00:46:33.582 --> 00:46:36.210
Please note my attendance
in the court records.

00:46:36.294 --> 00:46:38.629
Did you say you were
the legal counsel for the victim?

00:46:38.713 --> 00:46:39.839
Yes, that is correct.

00:46:41.465 --> 00:46:43.426
You don't need to shout your answers.

00:46:45.636 --> 00:46:47.388
Record her attendance.

00:46:49.223 --> 00:46:52.893
The defendant tore out approximately
25 cm of the city gas pipe and meter

00:46:52.977 --> 00:46:55.688
connected to the boiler
in the sauna's mechanical room

00:46:55.771 --> 00:46:58.816
and installed
an unauthorized copper pipe in its place

00:46:58.899 --> 00:47:00.568
to illegally siphon city gas.

00:47:00.651 --> 00:47:03.779
The stolen amount is not noted.
How much was it?

00:47:03.863 --> 00:47:04.822
Well, you see…

00:47:05.448 --> 00:47:06.407
It's still under review.

00:47:07.867 --> 00:47:10.244
The trial can't proceed
without knowing the extent.

00:47:10.328 --> 00:47:11.370
{\an8}Yes, Your Honor…

00:47:11.454 --> 00:47:14.290
{\an8}But because they manipulated
the system used to calculate gas usage,

00:47:14.373 --> 00:47:16.584
assessing the extent of the theft
will take some time.

00:47:16.667 --> 00:47:18.377
We'll submit it at the next hearing.

00:47:19.003 --> 00:47:20.129
I understand.

00:47:20.963 --> 00:47:24.675
It's not like we can install
a properly working meter next to it

00:47:24.759 --> 00:47:27.178
and compare the two.

00:47:27.720 --> 00:47:29.013
Prosecutor.

00:47:29.096 --> 00:47:30.348
Excuse me, Prosecutor.

00:47:31.098 --> 00:47:32.641
We can estimate the stolen amount.

00:47:34.477 --> 00:47:37.605
{\an8}Your Honor, may I have a moment
to speak with the victim's counsel?

00:47:37.688 --> 00:47:39.357
Yes, you may.

00:47:40.232 --> 00:47:42.485
We'll take a short recess.

00:47:52.328 --> 00:47:54.038
Based on my calculations,

00:47:54.121 --> 00:47:58.751
a total of 2,486,839 cubic meters
were stolen over the last seven years,

00:47:58.834 --> 00:48:01.545
worth approximately a market value
of 1,323,270,000 won.

00:48:01.629 --> 00:48:03.964
About 1.3 billion?
How did you get that number?

00:48:11.806 --> 00:48:14.308
I visited all the saunas
in the area where the theft occurred.

00:48:14.392 --> 00:48:15.267
AUDIT REPORT

00:48:15.351 --> 00:48:17.436
Boiler performance,
quantity, hot water temperature,

00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:19.855
number of hot water tubs,
hot water maintenance duration,

00:48:19.939 --> 00:48:22.691
and business hours
were considered in the calculations.

00:48:22.775 --> 00:48:25.778
These variables were organized
by each bathhouse,

00:48:25.861 --> 00:48:29.240
and the total was calculated
using a formula developed with the victim.

00:48:30.491 --> 00:48:32.576
Our client suffered
around 1.3 billion won in damages.

00:48:32.660 --> 00:48:35.955
The same method was used
in other regions for theft as well.

00:48:36.038 --> 00:48:37.915
If we combine all the damage suffered,

00:48:37.998 --> 00:48:40.126
I believe it'll be around 3.8 billion won.

00:48:40.751 --> 00:48:43.129
And the amount we calculated

00:48:43.212 --> 00:48:45.756
assumes operation at maximum efficiency.

00:48:46.382 --> 00:48:48.634
But it's hard to maintain
such efficiency in real life,

00:48:48.717 --> 00:48:51.637
so we suspect the actual amount
to be much higher.

00:48:55.307 --> 00:48:56.392
Your Honor.

00:48:56.475 --> 00:48:58.894
With the court's permission,
we'd like to submit

00:48:58.978 --> 00:49:01.313
the materials prepared
by the victim's counsel into evidence.

00:49:01.397 --> 00:49:03.732
Yes, let us hear it first.

00:49:04.358 --> 00:49:06.402
As per the defense counsel's materials,

00:49:06.485 --> 00:49:09.572
Gangdong City Gas suffered
about 1.3 billion won in damages.

00:49:10.197 --> 00:49:12.283
- Wow…
- That is the estimate.

00:49:12.908 --> 00:49:14.827
As this method
was also utilized in other regions,

00:49:14.910 --> 00:49:17.830
we estimate the total damage suffered
to be around 3.8 billion won.

00:49:17.913 --> 00:49:19.123
Did you say 3.8 billion won?

00:49:19.206 --> 00:49:20.332
Yes, that is correct.

00:49:20.833 --> 00:49:22.376
In light of the higher amount,

00:49:22.460 --> 00:49:24.753
we request a harsher sentence
for the defendant.

00:49:24.837 --> 00:49:27.089
{\an8}Wait, Your Honor! This is nonsense.

00:49:27.840 --> 00:49:31.218
We are just a small business
trying to get by.

00:49:31.302 --> 00:49:33.471
We were just looking
to lower our gas bill a bit.

00:49:33.554 --> 00:49:35.848
I am aware that it was wrong,

00:49:36.807 --> 00:49:40.311
but we made that unfortunate choice
because we were struggling to survive.

00:49:40.394 --> 00:49:43.189
For a massive gas company
holding a supply monopoly

00:49:43.272 --> 00:49:45.858
to hire a major law firm like Yullim

00:49:45.941 --> 00:49:49.737
to come down on powerless,
small business owners like us…

00:49:49.820 --> 00:49:51.739
Isn't that just unfair?

00:49:51.822 --> 00:49:54.408
Defendant, please try
to calm down and sit back down.

00:49:54.492 --> 00:49:56.118
- Please sit down.
- My goodness.

00:50:00.998 --> 00:50:04.168
Does the victim's counsel
have anything to add?

00:50:04.835 --> 00:50:05.878
Yes, I do!

00:50:06.545 --> 00:50:08.214
You don't need to shout.

00:50:09.131 --> 00:50:10.216
Go ahead.

00:50:10.299 --> 00:50:11.425
Thank you.

00:50:12.092 --> 00:50:14.011
May I step forward for a moment?

00:50:14.678 --> 00:50:15.679
Yes, you may.

00:50:26.148 --> 00:50:27.149
Your Honor,

00:50:27.816 --> 00:50:29.485
the defendant is acting as if this case

00:50:29.568 --> 00:50:32.905
is between a small business owner
and a giant gas company,

00:50:33.572 --> 00:50:37.368
claiming to be the victim
of a classic power imbalance.

00:50:40.120 --> 00:50:41.830
However, the victim, Gangdong City Gas,

00:50:41.914 --> 00:50:44.917
is comprised of ordinary citizens
working under conditions

00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:46.835
even harsher than the defendant's.

00:50:46.919 --> 00:50:47.920
{\an8}GANGDONG CITY GAS

00:50:48.003 --> 00:50:50.047
{\an8}Through rain and snow,

00:50:50.130 --> 00:50:52.299
{\an8}through scorching summers
and bitter winters,

00:50:52.383 --> 00:50:55.010
the meter readers visit every home
to check the meters.

00:50:55.803 --> 00:50:57.304
The engineers work through

00:50:57.388 --> 00:51:00.808
the stifling heat of the boiler room,
even in the middle of summer.

00:51:00.891 --> 00:51:04.478
Someone's gain always comes
at someone else's expense.

00:51:05.020 --> 00:51:06.814
The damage suffered by the gas company

00:51:07.982 --> 00:51:11.485
became a burden that fell squarely
on actual small business owners.

00:51:11.569 --> 00:51:12.861
{\an8}CLASSIC WHOLE FRIED CHICKEN

00:51:12.945 --> 00:51:13.821
Enjoy.

00:51:13.904 --> 00:51:16.699
Small business owners
who work hard every day

00:51:17.324 --> 00:51:18.492
without stealing…

00:51:19.868 --> 00:51:21.912
Those struggling small business owners

00:51:21.996 --> 00:51:24.665
are the ones who deserve
to be protected by the law.

00:51:26.709 --> 00:51:28.252
- Hey! What are you doing?
- Hold on…

00:51:28.335 --> 00:51:30.004
Defendant, please sit down.

00:51:30.087 --> 00:51:31.672
Do not point fingers in court.

00:51:31.755 --> 00:51:32.631
- Jeez!
- Just stop…

00:51:32.715 --> 00:51:34.174
- This is a sham trial.
- Stop…

00:51:34.258 --> 00:51:36.468
- It makes no sense.
- We don't want a public defender.

00:51:36.552 --> 00:51:38.846
We'll switch over to a major law firm.

00:51:38.929 --> 00:51:39.847
Quiet down, Defendant.

00:51:39.930 --> 00:51:41.223
- Sit down.
- This is nonsense!

00:51:41.307 --> 00:51:43.017
- What? 3.8 billion won?
- When did I ever…

00:51:43.100 --> 00:51:45.019
I never stole that much.

00:51:45.394 --> 00:51:46.770
YULLIM
KANG HYO-MIN, LITIGATION

00:51:48.105 --> 00:51:49.148
We'll be in touch.

00:51:49.231 --> 00:51:50.941
- Okay.
- Thank you, Counsel.

00:51:59.325 --> 00:52:00.367
Hello, Ms. Kang.

00:52:00.868 --> 00:52:02.661
I'm from Asia City Gas.

00:52:03.245 --> 00:52:04.997
I see.

00:52:05.080 --> 00:52:07.583
We were hoping to retain you
for this case as well.

00:52:07.666 --> 00:52:08.917
What do we need to do?

00:52:10.169 --> 00:52:11.045
Well…

00:52:11.128 --> 00:52:14.465
I'm from Songju City Gas,
and we'd also like to retain you.

00:52:15.299 --> 00:52:16.592
Thank you in advance.

00:52:16.675 --> 00:52:18.761
I'm from Seonam City Gas.

00:52:18.844 --> 00:52:20.179
Please work on our case.

00:52:20.262 --> 00:52:21.597
We'd really appreciate it.

00:52:22.097 --> 00:52:22.973
Hello, I'm…

00:52:26.602 --> 00:52:28.103
That's amazing, Hyo-min.

00:52:29.396 --> 00:52:30.814
- I did well, right?
- Yeah.

00:52:31.774 --> 00:52:33.108
That only makes it sting more.

00:52:33.192 --> 00:52:35.277
You should be with us, Lee & Seo.

00:52:35.361 --> 00:52:38.530
If word gets out you're good at your job,
you'll be swamped. That's trouble.

00:52:38.614 --> 00:52:39.490
Being busy is good.

00:52:40.616 --> 00:52:43.452
Maybe we should
just move in together now.

00:52:44.161 --> 00:52:45.079
Don't be ridiculous.

00:52:45.788 --> 00:52:48.248
You were busy studying in law school.

00:52:48.332 --> 00:52:50.834
I thought we'd see each other
every day at Lee & Seo,

00:52:50.918 --> 00:52:52.628
but you joined our competitor firm.

00:52:52.711 --> 00:52:55.464
If you're good at your job on top of that,
late nights are guaranteed.

00:52:55.547 --> 00:52:57.257
We'll hardly be able to go on dates.

00:52:58.008 --> 00:52:59.677
I just joined Yullim.

00:53:00.177 --> 00:53:02.221
Keep yourself busy while I settle in.

00:53:03.222 --> 00:53:04.682
You're always my top priority.

00:53:04.765 --> 00:53:07.351
When will I ever become yours?

00:53:07.434 --> 00:53:08.352
Jeez…

00:53:11.855 --> 00:53:13.023
Hello, Attorney Heo!

00:53:14.191 --> 00:53:15.359
Hello, Attorney Han.

00:53:16.485 --> 00:53:18.070
How nice to run into you here.

00:53:18.153 --> 00:53:19.655
Did you have dinner here?

00:53:19.738 --> 00:53:21.031
Yes, with…

00:53:21.115 --> 00:53:22.866
the girl I'll be marrying soon.

00:53:22.950 --> 00:53:23.909
"Marry"?

00:53:24.451 --> 00:53:26.995
What splendid news.

00:53:27.663 --> 00:53:30.916
It's nice to meet you. Your name?

00:53:30.999 --> 00:53:31.917
I'm Kang--

00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:33.544
She is Attorney Kang Hyo-min.

00:53:33.627 --> 00:53:35.546
She just joined Yullim
as an entry-level attorney.

00:53:35.629 --> 00:53:36.839
I see…

00:53:37.339 --> 00:53:38.465
You're a lawyer.

00:53:38.549 --> 00:53:41.093
Yullim is also a great law firm.

00:53:41.176 --> 00:53:42.094
Yes.

00:53:43.387 --> 00:53:45.848
She is Chief Judge
Kang Il-chan's only daughter.

00:53:45.931 --> 00:53:50.185
So you're Judge Kang Il-chan's daughter.

00:53:51.228 --> 00:53:54.732
Her mother is
Professor Choi Eun-hee at SNU Law.

00:53:54.815 --> 00:53:57.609
My goodness,
what an amazing person you are.

00:53:59.403 --> 00:54:02.322
Where in the world
did you meet this precious woman?

00:54:02.406 --> 00:54:04.158
You are just blessed beyond belief.

00:54:05.117 --> 00:54:07.911
I must have saved the country
in a past life.

00:54:26.263 --> 00:54:27.181
Are you okay?

00:54:29.349 --> 00:54:32.352
You seem a little down,

00:54:32.436 --> 00:54:33.812
and you've been quiet.

00:54:34.313 --> 00:54:35.814
I'm fine.

00:54:35.898 --> 00:54:38.233
What's wrong? Did I do something wrong?

00:54:41.612 --> 00:54:42.613
Why do you like me?

00:54:44.907 --> 00:54:47.493
Is this because
of how I introduced you earlier?

00:54:47.576 --> 00:54:49.828
Do you think I like you
because of your background?

00:54:49.912 --> 00:54:50.996
I just…

00:54:51.079 --> 00:54:52.122
Unbelievable.

00:54:52.790 --> 00:54:54.291
Gosh, you and your girlish feelings.

00:54:56.418 --> 00:54:57.336
Hyo-min.

00:54:57.419 --> 00:55:00.756
This might sound cold,
but "girlish" is just being polite.

00:55:00.839 --> 00:55:02.800
That's actually an immature mindset.

00:55:02.883 --> 00:55:04.885
Well, if you're not careful,

00:55:05.469 --> 00:55:08.305
you might come off as a bit smug,
like someone privileged showing off.

00:55:08.972 --> 00:55:10.516
Your background is a part of you.

00:55:10.599 --> 00:55:13.268
We're too old to be bitter
about someone benefiting from privilege.

00:55:14.436 --> 00:55:16.730
And to say it's shallow
to consider someone's background.

00:55:17.773 --> 00:55:20.692
A marriage can't work with just emotions.

00:55:21.360 --> 00:55:22.778
Truth be told,

00:55:23.320 --> 00:55:27.199
your family background
and excellent genetics are included

00:55:27.866 --> 00:55:29.868
in the reasons why I love you.

00:55:30.661 --> 00:55:31.578
Hyo-min,

00:55:31.662 --> 00:55:34.790
I want to pass along
elite genes to my kids.

00:55:35.415 --> 00:55:38.752
Just thinking about my wife,
whom I can always be proud of,

00:55:38.836 --> 00:55:41.338
and our kids, who will grow up
in comfort and care,

00:55:42.047 --> 00:55:43.674
makes me so emotional.

00:55:46.176 --> 00:55:48.095
I also like your "girlish" sentiments.

00:55:52.558 --> 00:55:54.768
- I have something to tell you.
- Sure. Go ahead.

00:55:56.103 --> 00:55:57.604
Not today. Later.

00:55:58.856 --> 00:56:00.440
What? You're making me curious.

00:56:35.684 --> 00:56:36.810
Your dad's sleeping.

00:56:37.895 --> 00:56:39.146
Let's not bother him.

00:56:41.940 --> 00:56:43.066
Let's go, Hash.

00:56:56.288 --> 00:56:57.205
Are you awake?

00:56:57.915 --> 00:56:58.916
Yeah.

00:57:00.417 --> 00:57:01.668
Should we have breakfast?

00:57:03.670 --> 00:57:04.922
What should I make?

00:57:05.005 --> 00:57:06.590
No, I'll make breakfast.

00:57:07.424 --> 00:57:08.592
Really?

00:57:09.092 --> 00:57:10.135
- Yeah.
- Like what?

00:57:10.677 --> 00:57:11.720
What do you want?

00:57:12.346 --> 00:57:13.221
Me?

00:57:14.264 --> 00:57:15.265
Your lips.

00:57:20.687 --> 00:57:21.897
Hey, Hash.

00:57:22.439 --> 00:57:24.566
Hash, attack him with kisses.

00:57:24.650 --> 00:57:26.610
- Hey, Hash.
- There's Dad.

00:57:26.693 --> 00:57:28.445
- Yes, Hash.
- Give Dad a kiss.

00:57:28.528 --> 00:57:30.906
- My little puppy…
- Does it make you that happy?

00:57:31.990 --> 00:57:33.367
- Hash, aren't you sleepy?
- Hash.

00:57:33.450 --> 00:57:35.118
Goodness, Hash.

00:57:38.121 --> 00:57:39.581
You like Dad the most, right?

00:57:48.340 --> 00:57:49.257
What are you doing?

00:57:53.220 --> 00:57:55.514
I told you not to drink coffee at night.

00:57:56.682 --> 00:57:57.724
It's fine.

00:57:58.767 --> 00:57:59.935
I sleep perfectly fine.

00:58:01.520 --> 00:58:02.813
Were you watching Hash?

00:58:04.564 --> 00:58:05.440
Yes.

00:58:07.192 --> 00:58:08.652
I guess you miss Hash.

00:58:11.738 --> 00:58:12.698
Yeah.

00:58:14.908 --> 00:58:15.784
What about me?

00:58:18.412 --> 00:58:19.371
I don't miss you.

00:58:21.248 --> 00:58:22.374
Liar.

00:59:25.604 --> 00:59:28.857
BEYOND THE BAR

00:59:28.982 --> 00:59:31.109
Where's Mr. Yoon rushing off to?

00:59:31.193 --> 00:59:33.737
- He gets off work early on Fridays.
- Why?

00:59:33.820 --> 00:59:35.572
- To pick his kid up.
- A kid?

00:59:36.948 --> 00:59:38.283
{\an8}Kang Hyo-min, my darling,

00:59:39.868 --> 00:59:41.203
{\an8}will you marry me?

00:59:41.286 --> 00:59:43.830
{\an8}I entrusted my sperm
to Hoseon Fertility Clinic,

00:59:43.914 --> 00:59:46.458
{\an8}and those bastards destroyed
my precious sperm by mistake.

00:59:46.541 --> 00:59:48.794
{\an8}We need something big
to turn the tables.

00:59:48.877 --> 00:59:51.213
{\an8}We haven't found it yet,

00:59:51.296 --> 00:59:52.255
{\an8}so until then, we bluff.

00:59:52.339 --> 00:59:53.757
{\an8}Can you handle the consequences?

00:59:53.840 --> 00:59:58.386
{\an8}If I'm at a disadvantage in the ring,
I take it outside and finish it there.

00:59:59.513 --> 01:00:01.098
{\an8}I found the game changer.

01:00:01.807 --> 01:00:04.643
{\an8}And we're claiming
500 million won in damages.

01:00:04.726 --> 01:00:06.561
{\an8}Let's have a word.

01:00:07.479 --> 01:00:09.439
{\an8}Do you think that makes any sense?

01:00:09.523 --> 01:00:13.485
{\an8}In a lawsuit, it's not about who wins.
It's about who gets hurt less.

01:00:22.786 --> 01:00:23.954
KANG HYO-MIN

01:00:40.470 --> 01:00:43.682
- Don't take Hyo-ju away.
- Hyo-min.

01:00:43.765 --> 01:00:48.019
Don't take Hyo-ju away.

01:00:56.528 --> 01:00:58.530
