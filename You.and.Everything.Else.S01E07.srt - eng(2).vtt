00:00:46.046 --> 00:00:49.966
YOU AND EVERYTHING ELSE

00:00:56.181 --> 00:00:57.932
Do you like Sang-hak?

00:01:02.312 --> 00:01:03.146
No.

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:05.815
The person you met online
while you were in Gangneung…

00:01:09.486 --> 00:01:10.987
Your crush…

00:01:13.364 --> 00:01:14.783
It's him, isn't it?

00:01:26.336 --> 00:01:29.089
-Why would you think he's--
-Am I wrong?

00:01:31.466 --> 00:01:33.301
-You're wrong.
-Then who is it?

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:48.316
He's a guitarist who used to play
in an amateur band.

00:01:56.324 --> 00:01:58.451
At first, I wasn't too interested.

00:02:00.495 --> 00:02:02.872
Then I heard he quit school
to pursue music.

00:02:03.414 --> 00:02:06.543
I went to see him perform
out of curiosity, and he was pretty cool.

00:02:11.548 --> 00:02:15.510
I was rather blown away
by his left-handed strumming technique.

00:02:20.974 --> 00:02:22.684
He's still a guitarist.

00:02:23.852 --> 00:02:25.228
He plays in a famous band now.

00:02:30.275 --> 00:02:32.944
I heard that you messaged Sang-hak
back then.

00:02:34.028 --> 00:02:37.490
Why did you hide the fact
that you knew him?

00:02:42.871 --> 00:02:45.039
I see. Uncle Dong-gu told you?

00:02:47.292 --> 00:02:49.711
-Yes.
-I sent him a single message.

00:02:50.378 --> 00:02:52.422
I didn't want to tell him
my brother was dead,

00:02:53.423 --> 00:02:55.466
so I sent a message as him.

00:02:59.095 --> 00:03:02.557
How would I have known
that Uncle Tat was him?

00:03:07.478 --> 00:03:08.646
Why do I find all this…

00:03:14.736 --> 00:03:16.196
hard to believe?

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:21.784
I'm not saying that you're lying.

00:03:24.954 --> 00:03:26.706
I don't want to doubt you.

00:03:30.001 --> 00:03:31.336
I don't want to…

00:03:33.713 --> 00:03:34.964
doubt you,

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:38.885
not even the slightest bit.

00:03:43.514 --> 00:03:44.974
Be honest with me.

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:49.771
Have you ever liked Sang-hak?

00:03:53.858 --> 00:03:54.943
Never.

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.989
Then what favor did you ask of him?

00:04:10.708 --> 00:04:12.043
It's about my brother.

00:04:14.087 --> 00:04:15.463
It's about your brother…

00:04:18.383 --> 00:04:20.551
but you'd rather not share it with me?

00:04:26.391 --> 00:04:27.392
Not at this moment.

00:04:31.771 --> 00:04:33.481
Will you tell me eventually?

00:04:38.903 --> 00:04:40.697
Once I have all the answers.

00:04:47.203 --> 00:04:48.204
That's a promise.

00:04:50.331 --> 00:04:51.165
Okay.

00:04:55.628 --> 00:04:56.963
I'll really believe you now.

00:04:59.382 --> 00:05:00.216
As you should.

00:05:02.635 --> 00:05:04.345
Can I change now?

00:05:05.305 --> 00:05:06.139
What?

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:08.516
Right.

00:05:09.559 --> 00:05:10.810
I'll leave you to it.

00:05:36.336 --> 00:05:39.297
SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING

00:05:40.715 --> 00:05:44.427
But did I actually believe Sang-yeon?

00:05:47.347 --> 00:05:48.389
I believed her.

00:05:49.557 --> 00:05:50.433
No.

00:05:51.559 --> 00:05:52.977
I wanted to believe her.

00:05:56.606 --> 00:05:59.400
But my emotions got the best of me.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.586
SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING
FRESHMEN

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:55.248
Where have you been?

00:06:57.959 --> 00:07:01.462
I went for a run.
It's good for your health, you know.

00:07:02.547 --> 00:07:04.382
Sure. The bathroom's all yours.

00:07:06.217 --> 00:07:09.512
Should we have tteokguk for breakfast?

00:07:11.556 --> 00:07:13.349
Yeah. Let me wash up real quick.

00:07:14.183 --> 00:07:15.017
Sure.

00:07:49.218 --> 00:07:50.761
So let me ask you this.

00:07:52.805 --> 00:07:54.265
Be honest with me.

00:07:57.894 --> 00:07:59.770
Have you ever liked Sang-hak?

00:08:12.533 --> 00:08:13.534
Hello?

00:08:15.453 --> 00:08:16.704
Yes, it's me.

00:08:22.418 --> 00:08:26.547
Wait, she seriously asked you
to be her boyfriend over the phone?

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:30.801
Yes. My mind went blank for three seconds.

00:08:31.677 --> 00:08:33.304
I couldn't believe my ears.

00:08:33.387 --> 00:08:36.057
It was pretty smooth.
He also consented right away.

00:08:38.309 --> 00:08:40.603
She says it was smooth.

00:08:40.686 --> 00:08:41.979
I guess it was.

00:08:42.813 --> 00:08:44.273
-Wasn't it?
-Not at all.

00:08:47.443 --> 00:08:49.737
Now that I've met you,
it's finally setting in.

00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:51.322
I hear it's only official

00:08:51.405 --> 00:08:55.326
when your girlfriend
introduces you to her friends.

00:08:58.663 --> 00:09:01.123
Aren't you Sang-yeon's closest friend?

00:09:05.962 --> 00:09:09.340
I don't know about her, but she is to me.
She's my best friend.

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:14.428
Best friend or not,
she is the only friend I have.

00:09:14.512 --> 00:09:18.182
So, as of today,
you've met all of my friends.

00:09:19.642 --> 00:09:22.395
How did you two become so close?

00:09:24.021 --> 00:09:25.815
Well, she's a bit weird.

00:09:28.192 --> 00:09:29.860
How am I weird?

00:09:29.944 --> 00:09:34.407
She doesn't have an inferiority complex
or any insecurities.

00:09:36.033 --> 00:09:41.289
You think I have no insecurities?
That's nonsense. I have a ton.

00:09:41.956 --> 00:09:43.916
Then what makes you insecure?

00:09:45.543 --> 00:09:46.627
This one right here.

00:09:47.295 --> 00:09:48.421
Me?

00:09:48.504 --> 00:09:49.547
Yes, you.

00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:52.800
She's been good at everything
ever since we were kids.

00:09:53.301 --> 00:09:55.094
Not only is she super smart,

00:09:55.177 --> 00:09:58.514
she's a great photographer and dancer.

00:09:58.598 --> 00:10:00.558
She was even a fast runner.

00:10:00.641 --> 00:10:03.936
How unfair is that?
Does she really have to be athletic too?

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:08.274
Does that mean that
Sang-yeon is somewhat of a rival to you?

00:10:11.652 --> 00:10:12.737
-A rival?
-Yes.

00:10:16.532 --> 00:10:20.578
See? I knew it.
She has no such thing as a rival.

00:10:20.661 --> 00:10:21.996
I do.

00:10:22.079 --> 00:10:27.376
But doesn't rivalry kick in
when you have the urge to beat someone?

00:10:28.252 --> 00:10:30.046
I've only ever envied her.

00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:33.257
I could never dream
of winning against her.

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:37.678
You're one to talk. Do you even know
what an inferiority complex is?

00:10:38.179 --> 00:10:39.555
Of course I do.

00:10:40.348 --> 00:10:43.809
I'm just one big blob of insecurities
and inferiority complexes.

00:10:44.602 --> 00:10:45.436
You are?

00:10:46.979 --> 00:10:50.608
-Yeah.
-Who's ever made you feel insecure?

00:11:00.951 --> 00:11:02.495
Let's just say there was no one.

00:11:03.454 --> 00:11:06.040
See? She's just pretending
she has insecurities.

00:11:06.123 --> 00:11:09.293
People with true insecurities
can never admit it like you.

00:11:10.336 --> 00:11:13.381
If you can open up about it,
it's not a true insecurity.

00:11:15.257 --> 00:11:17.885
I have to admit, she has a point.

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:22.181
What do you mean she has a point?

00:11:23.849 --> 00:11:24.684
Cheers.

00:11:41.575 --> 00:11:43.285
Easy there, soldier.

00:11:53.838 --> 00:11:55.464
-It's good.
-It is?

00:11:55.548 --> 00:11:56.757
-Yeah.
-Eat up.

00:12:07.017 --> 00:12:10.521
You haven't received the letter
I sent on Monday, have you?

00:12:12.148 --> 00:12:16.068
On Monday? The last one came
the day before yesterday.

00:12:16.569 --> 00:12:17.778
Did you write again?

00:12:19.697 --> 00:12:21.949
Trash it the moment you get it.

00:12:23.033 --> 00:12:24.076
What did you write?

00:12:24.744 --> 00:12:25.578
What do you think?

00:12:25.661 --> 00:12:26.787
To come visit you?

00:12:27.455 --> 00:12:28.456
Do you have to ask?

00:12:28.539 --> 00:12:32.877
Well, I'm here now.
Don't you get it? I'm still mad.

00:12:33.502 --> 00:12:35.921
And how long are you going to stay mad?

00:12:38.466 --> 00:12:40.176
I'll forgive you since you ran here.

00:12:42.011 --> 00:12:43.429
Are you happy to see me?

00:12:43.512 --> 00:12:45.723
Happy doesn't cut it.
I can finally breathe.

00:12:48.559 --> 00:12:49.477
Dig in.

00:12:49.977 --> 00:12:52.521
How's the prep for the exhibition?

00:12:52.605 --> 00:12:55.858
I'm the only one who's done printing.
The others just got started.

00:12:56.442 --> 00:12:58.986
-Whose photo is on the poster?
-Sang-yeon's.

00:12:59.069 --> 00:13:00.905
The lead photo is also Sang-yeon's.

00:13:02.198 --> 00:13:03.657
Which photos did you choose?

00:13:05.117 --> 00:13:08.245
Just four photos of a foggy Yangsuri.

00:13:08.329 --> 00:13:09.497
From the spring trip?

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:10.915
Yes.

00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:23.511
I'm not thrilled with them, but Mom's shop
will be busy next week for New Year's,

00:13:23.594 --> 00:13:25.262
so I wanted to get it over with.

00:13:25.346 --> 00:13:27.056
Those photos of Yangsuri are fine.

00:13:28.641 --> 00:13:32.853
No, they're great. Brilliant.
Not just fine, they're the best.

00:13:42.446 --> 00:13:45.449
I met Sang-yeon's boyfriend last week.

00:13:47.576 --> 00:13:49.036
Does he seem like a good guy?

00:13:49.119 --> 00:13:50.955
He's great. He seems nice.

00:13:52.373 --> 00:13:54.792
He said we should all hang out
when you next get out.

00:13:55.459 --> 00:13:56.293
Sure, why not?

00:14:07.346 --> 00:14:09.265
Ma'am, how much are
your sliced rice cakes?

00:14:09.765 --> 00:14:13.227
What are you doing here?
You don't have tutoring today.

00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:15.855
I was bored. How can I help?

00:14:18.023 --> 00:14:20.442
Why, Sang-yeon! You're here.

00:14:21.277 --> 00:14:22.319
Have you eaten?

00:14:22.403 --> 00:14:23.487
Yes. How can I help?

00:14:23.571 --> 00:14:25.239
-Just stay put.
-Let me help.

00:14:30.035 --> 00:14:31.912
Are you sure you can help for three days?

00:14:31.996 --> 00:14:35.708
Yes. I don't have tutoring on holidays,
and selling rice cakes is fun.

00:14:36.750 --> 00:14:39.211
Fun, my foot. You better buckle up.

00:14:39.295 --> 00:14:41.463
It's going to get intense
starting tomorrow.

00:14:43.924 --> 00:14:49.096
I could sense
that Sang-yeon was making an effort.

00:14:51.432 --> 00:14:54.101
-Good luck with your sales.
-Thank you, and happy new year.

00:14:54.184 --> 00:14:55.644
-That's 5,000 won.
-Excuse me.

00:14:56.687 --> 00:14:59.773
-Three packs for 5,000 won.
-Three? That's a steal.

00:15:21.128 --> 00:15:22.087
It's snowing.

00:15:23.464 --> 00:15:24.924
How pretty.

00:15:48.364 --> 00:15:53.243
At last, it seemed as though
everything was falling back into place.

00:16:07.967 --> 00:16:09.927
Hey, darn it! Come here, you!

00:16:10.010 --> 00:16:11.804
Hey, no. Don't!

00:16:18.519 --> 00:16:21.105
Even my clean clothes reek of cooking oil…

00:16:32.616 --> 00:16:33.742
Are you all packed?

00:16:34.827 --> 00:16:35.703
Yeah.

00:16:36.787 --> 00:16:38.205
Don't forget your scarf.

00:16:38.706 --> 00:16:39.540
Right.

00:16:43.043 --> 00:16:45.963
I love this photo more
every time I see it.

00:16:48.382 --> 00:16:50.801
Kim Sang-hak is quite the photographer.

00:16:54.304 --> 00:16:56.223
Why do you like this photo so much?

00:16:57.307 --> 00:17:00.644
Because the photographer's affection
for the subject is palpable.

00:17:03.022 --> 00:17:04.898
I beat him to it, you know.

00:17:10.529 --> 00:17:11.613
This photo of him.

00:17:12.781 --> 00:17:14.742
I took this that day before he took that.

00:17:21.165 --> 00:17:22.041
Like a pair.

00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:24.334
"A pair"?

00:17:25.753 --> 00:17:26.587
Yes.

00:17:39.391 --> 00:17:42.227
Hey, Chang-wook. It's me, Eun-jung.

00:17:42.311 --> 00:17:44.646
The final prints are due today, right?

00:17:45.981 --> 00:17:48.317
I'd like to change my photo.

00:17:49.109 --> 00:17:49.943
Sure.

00:17:58.452 --> 00:17:59.995
CHEON SANG-YEON

00:18:08.754 --> 00:18:13.967
I got her phone number,
but she wants to speak with you first.

00:18:14.593 --> 00:18:16.428
She's not answering my calls.

00:18:17.471 --> 00:18:19.681
I know it puts you in a tight spot,

00:18:20.182 --> 00:18:22.518
but could you please help me talk to her?

00:18:30.192 --> 00:18:33.237
Please state your name
while your call is connected.

00:18:34.196 --> 00:18:37.282
Dylan. It's me, Tat. Uncle Tat.

00:18:38.575 --> 00:18:41.703
Checking if the recipient
is available to take the call.

00:19:20.242 --> 00:19:22.035
-Sir!
-Sir!

00:19:22.536 --> 00:19:23.620
Good day, sir.

00:19:26.081 --> 00:19:28.125
-Sang-hak.
-Private First Class Kim Sang-hak.

00:19:28.208 --> 00:19:29.209
You have a visitor.

00:19:29.751 --> 00:19:31.253
-A visitor, sir?
-Yeah.

00:19:32.421 --> 00:19:34.506
She's really pretty. Who is she?

00:20:03.702 --> 00:20:04.703
Dylan.

00:20:12.711 --> 00:20:13.754
What is this?

00:20:15.839 --> 00:20:17.716
A letter from Moonee.

00:20:21.386 --> 00:20:24.389
-I get he wrote this letter, but--
-Do you get it now?

00:20:25.682 --> 00:20:29.937
Do you understand…
why I wanted to speak to you first?

00:20:33.023 --> 00:20:36.568
What would you do if you were me?

00:20:38.445 --> 00:20:42.074
Should I meet with… Moonee's sister?

00:20:56.463 --> 00:21:01.051
Now, remember,
it's one pamphlet per person.

00:21:01.134 --> 00:21:03.762
If you want extra, you better pay up.

00:21:03.845 --> 00:21:05.222
-I'd like two.
-Okay.

00:21:05.305 --> 00:21:07.224
-Me too.
-Okay, hold on.

00:21:08.475 --> 00:21:09.559
Me too, please.

00:21:09.643 --> 00:21:11.270
-Okay.
-You too?

00:21:14.314 --> 00:21:18.860
I wish I could also say, "Me too."
It's like declaring a relationship.

00:21:18.944 --> 00:21:21.780
By the way, can anyone bring a car?

00:21:22.281 --> 00:21:25.242
Delivering the frames ourselves
could save us 50,000 won.

00:21:25.325 --> 00:21:27.077
Too bad Sang-hak isn't here.

00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:30.289
Can't he come out on leave?
He is part of the exhibit.

00:21:30.372 --> 00:21:31.415
His next one's far off.

00:21:31.498 --> 00:21:34.167
I asked just in case,
but his next leave is in April.

00:21:35.711 --> 00:21:40.257
Wait, Hyeong-kyu can drive.
How about we ask him?

00:21:40.340 --> 00:21:41.174
Hyeong-kyu?

00:21:42.426 --> 00:21:44.970
I'm meeting him later,
so I'll ask him then.

00:21:45.053 --> 00:21:47.514
I think you should ask him now.

00:21:47.597 --> 00:21:50.142
I guess it is pretty urgent.
I'll go ask him now.

00:21:50.225 --> 00:21:51.351
Okay.

00:21:53.937 --> 00:21:55.564
-Wait, Su-mi.
-Yes?

00:21:55.647 --> 00:21:58.358
Did that date you set up for her go well?

00:21:58.442 --> 00:22:00.902
-Yeah.
-No way. Is he handsome?

00:22:01.695 --> 00:22:05.115
We just need help delivering the frames
in the morning.

00:22:11.705 --> 00:22:12.956
Yes, that's great.

00:22:14.416 --> 00:22:15.584
Okay, see you later.

00:22:15.667 --> 00:22:18.920
What did I tell you?
I gave you the chance, didn't I?

00:22:19.004 --> 00:22:22.424
You did. That's too bad.
If only I'd known this would happen…

00:22:26.595 --> 00:22:28.930
Whatever, he's taken now.

00:22:29.514 --> 00:22:31.767
What did he say? Is he available?

00:22:33.810 --> 00:22:34.686
What the…

00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:36.355
How's everyone been?

00:22:36.855 --> 00:22:37.689
Sang-hak!

00:22:37.773 --> 00:22:40.484
-Is that…
-Kim Sang-hak!

00:22:40.567 --> 00:22:42.194
-How did you…
-How is he…

00:22:42.277 --> 00:22:44.654
-What the heck?
-How are you here?

00:22:44.738 --> 00:22:48.742
I was so anxious about the exhibit
that I couldn't focus on my duties.

00:22:48.825 --> 00:22:49.701
What?

00:22:49.785 --> 00:22:51.161
How great.

00:22:51.244 --> 00:22:53.246
-He didn't tell you either?
-He didn't.

00:22:53.330 --> 00:22:56.333
Let's resolve the car issue first.
Can you use your dad's tomorrow?

00:22:56.416 --> 00:22:59.586
To deliver the frames? I'll do it.
Sang-yeon told me just now.

00:23:04.841 --> 00:23:06.009
Why didn't you tell me?

00:23:10.055 --> 00:23:11.848
Seriously, how did you get out?

00:23:11.932 --> 00:23:15.519
Wasn't your next leave in April?
Did you really come for the exhibition?

00:23:16.812 --> 00:23:20.524
Yes. I applied last minute,
but my commander approved my leave.

00:23:21.691 --> 00:23:25.028
This is great.
We're showing your photos too.

00:23:26.530 --> 00:23:28.782
You're here for your photos, aren't you?

00:23:28.865 --> 00:23:30.700
You're right. I'm here to hang my photos.

00:23:31.993 --> 00:23:35.497
I would have rescheduled tutoring
if I'd known you were coming.

00:23:36.039 --> 00:23:37.999
-When are you going back?
-Next Thursday.

00:23:39.334 --> 00:23:42.421
So we have ten days? Yay, I'm so excited!

00:23:42.504 --> 00:23:43.630
-I bet you are.
-Yeah.

00:23:43.713 --> 00:23:45.173
We have plenty of time.

00:23:46.383 --> 00:23:49.553
Look. Look at yourself closely.

00:23:55.517 --> 00:23:56.685
Okay, see you later.

00:23:59.229 --> 00:24:00.730
Are you out on leave?

00:24:00.814 --> 00:24:04.734
Yes. This is good, actually.
I need to tell you something.

00:24:17.622 --> 00:24:20.876
I'll deliver the frames.
You should be there tomorrow.

00:24:24.671 --> 00:24:27.090
-Get a move on.
-A-ra, is it heavy?

00:24:27.174 --> 00:24:28.133
Want to help me?

00:24:29.050 --> 00:24:29.885
Nope.

00:24:32.345 --> 00:24:33.180
How's this?

00:24:33.263 --> 00:24:36.391
A little lower. No, that's too low.

00:24:36.975 --> 00:24:37.893
How about this?

00:24:37.976 --> 00:24:39.102
Great.

00:24:44.733 --> 00:24:46.943
Doesn't it look amazing?

00:24:47.027 --> 00:24:48.987
Yeah, it's great.

00:24:49.070 --> 00:24:52.491
I love the tagline too.
"Moments, Unfamiliar Yet Familiar."

00:24:53.867 --> 00:24:55.494
Is he saying that because he knows?

00:24:55.577 --> 00:24:57.871
He has no idea. I came up with that.

00:24:58.455 --> 00:25:00.665
Really? Well, of course you did.

00:25:00.749 --> 00:25:02.918
By the way, what's up with Sang-yeon?

00:25:03.001 --> 00:25:06.463
Something came up with her mom
in Gangneung.

00:25:07.631 --> 00:25:10.592
She's sorry
she couldn't help set up today.

00:25:11.343 --> 00:25:15.222
She didn't look too well
when she left the house this morning.

00:25:15.305 --> 00:25:17.265
She said she hadn't slept a wink.

00:25:17.891 --> 00:25:19.142
It's fine.

00:25:23.063 --> 00:25:23.980
I like this.

00:25:49.589 --> 00:25:51.383
MOON JI-YEONG
ADDRESS: 29-88 MOSAN-DONG

00:25:51.466 --> 00:25:54.261
TAKE THE 42 BUS TO DOHARI VILLAGE

00:26:04.062 --> 00:26:07.482
She's moving to Canada for her studies,
so tomorrow's your only chance.

00:26:09.651 --> 00:26:11.361
If I go, will she see me?

00:26:11.945 --> 00:26:12.779
Yes.

00:26:18.368 --> 00:26:19.286
Thank you.

00:26:21.621 --> 00:26:22.581
Let's go inside.

00:26:23.081 --> 00:26:23.915
Sang-yeon.

00:26:27.752 --> 00:26:29.546
Her house is in the mountains.

00:26:30.171 --> 00:26:32.632
-So don't go alone, and--
-Don't worry.

00:26:33.675 --> 00:26:35.427
I'll go with my boyfriend.

00:26:56.072 --> 00:27:00.785
Sang-yeon used to be
really afraid of mountains.

00:27:01.828 --> 00:27:03.955
Her brother was found on a mountain.

00:27:06.958 --> 00:27:08.293
I said to the left.

00:27:08.793 --> 00:27:09.628
What?

00:27:12.422 --> 00:27:13.632
Sure, to the left.

00:27:14.257 --> 00:27:18.386
Yeah, weren't you listening?
Why do you seem so distracted?

00:27:20.847 --> 00:27:23.099
A bit more to the right. Just a bit.

00:27:23.975 --> 00:27:24.809
That's it.

00:27:26.853 --> 00:27:31.191
Hey, this looks awesome.
Your photos are going to steal the show.

00:27:31.691 --> 00:27:33.318
Half of them are his.

00:27:33.818 --> 00:27:37.572
Wow. You two are rather daring.

00:27:37.656 --> 00:27:40.283
How so? Wouldn't you
do something like this with Kyu-ho?

00:27:40.367 --> 00:27:42.911
I could never.
This would haunt me if we broke up.

00:27:42.994 --> 00:27:46.331
Is that right? If we break up,
apparently this will haunt us.

00:27:46.414 --> 00:27:47.874
We're never breaking up.

00:28:27.622 --> 00:28:30.333
Did you know
that your brother often spoke of you?

00:28:34.379 --> 00:28:35.505
He did?

00:28:37.424 --> 00:28:38.800
Very often.

00:28:39.718 --> 00:28:43.430
You were one of the two people
Moonee loved most.

00:28:44.180 --> 00:28:46.766
Your mother and you.

00:28:53.231 --> 00:28:54.274
I see.

00:28:56.067 --> 00:28:57.193
I never knew.

00:28:59.195 --> 00:29:01.406
What would you like to ask me?

00:29:06.619 --> 00:29:07.996
My brother

00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:11.207
liked you, didn't he?

00:29:14.836 --> 00:29:18.214
I assume you're asking
whether Moonee liked me romantically?

00:29:19.799 --> 00:29:20.884
-Yes.
-Moonee didn't.

00:29:22.802 --> 00:29:23.803
Not like that.

00:29:26.097 --> 00:29:28.725
If you ask me
whether I liked Moonee as a friend,

00:29:29.225 --> 00:29:31.019
it's a definite yes.

00:29:31.519 --> 00:29:32.771
I liked Moonee a lot.

00:29:33.605 --> 00:29:35.315
I'm sure Moonee felt the same.

00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:43.364
You don't have to lie about it…
because of my mom.

00:29:44.157 --> 00:29:47.160
I know she was opposed to him seeing you.

00:29:47.243 --> 00:29:48.787
I am not lying.

00:29:48.870 --> 00:29:51.956
I didn't make you come all the way here
just to tell you lies.

00:29:53.708 --> 00:29:58.046
And your mother never disapproved of me.

00:30:02.884 --> 00:30:06.095
Why were you under the impression
that she did?

00:30:09.808 --> 00:30:12.060
In his diary,

00:30:13.561 --> 00:30:16.356
every entry was a letter addressed to you.

00:30:16.940 --> 00:30:20.902
Well, to "M." A capital M.

00:30:23.154 --> 00:30:26.324
Right… Moon Ji-yeong.

00:30:38.711 --> 00:30:43.550
This is the letter Moonee wrote me
when we first became friends.

00:30:47.262 --> 00:30:49.764
TO DYLAN
-M

00:30:50.431 --> 00:30:51.599
This was from him?

00:30:52.892 --> 00:30:53.726
Yes.

00:31:02.527 --> 00:31:05.071
That's right. That's M.

00:31:07.824 --> 00:31:10.869
My friend Moonee.

00:31:14.247 --> 00:31:15.081
Hello.

00:31:15.164 --> 00:31:17.542
-Hey, Hyeong-kyu!
-Hello.

00:31:17.625 --> 00:31:21.504
Are you here to see Sang-yeon?
She went to Gangneung this morning.

00:31:22.088 --> 00:31:24.716
Right. She's in Gangneung, huh?

00:31:24.799 --> 00:31:28.303
You brought us pizza?
Guys, let's have pizza!

00:31:28.386 --> 00:31:29.762
-Please, eat.
-Okay.

00:31:29.846 --> 00:31:32.015
Did you come in secret to surprise her?

00:31:32.098 --> 00:31:34.350
-I'll just call her.
-Thank you for the pizza.

00:31:34.434 --> 00:31:36.603
-Eat up before it gets cold.
-Thank you.

00:31:50.992 --> 00:31:52.702
One sec, I need to take this.

00:31:52.785 --> 00:31:53.620
Sure.

00:31:56.706 --> 00:31:59.709
She disappeared? What do you mean she…

00:31:59.792 --> 00:32:01.502
She hasn't contacted you either?

00:32:01.586 --> 00:32:02.712
No, she hasn't.

00:32:02.795 --> 00:32:05.381
I was worried
because she didn't look well.

00:32:05.465 --> 00:32:08.009
I stepped out for a call
and came back to find her gone.

00:32:08.509 --> 00:32:10.053
Her phone is off as well.

00:32:12.889 --> 00:32:16.267
The number you have dialed is unavailable.
Please leave a message…

00:32:17.477 --> 00:32:18.937
Is she not picking up?

00:32:19.020 --> 00:32:21.481
No. Her phone's turned off.

00:32:22.982 --> 00:32:26.653
She might be sleeping on the bus.
She couldn't sleep yesterday.

00:32:26.736 --> 00:32:31.741
That might be the case. She seemed unwell
at the movies last night.

00:32:32.617 --> 00:32:34.619
What's taking Sang-hak so long?

00:32:34.702 --> 00:32:36.204
The pizza's almost gone.

00:32:36.871 --> 00:32:37.830
More for me.

00:32:59.143 --> 00:33:03.773
The number you have dialed
is currently busy. Please leave a message…

00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:09.237
She should be in the area.
The bus only comes every two hours, right?

00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:12.949
I'll continue to search for her.
Let me know right away if she calls you.

00:33:14.826 --> 00:33:18.079
Did you tell her everything?

00:33:21.207 --> 00:33:22.083
Yes.

00:33:22.917 --> 00:33:23.793
All of it?

00:33:24.752 --> 00:33:25.586
Yes.

00:33:30.383 --> 00:33:32.260
Okay. I'll call you back.

00:33:41.060 --> 00:33:42.478
EUN-JUNG

00:33:50.153 --> 00:33:50.987
Hey, Eun-jung.

00:33:51.946 --> 00:33:55.533
Hey, where are you?
Where did you go?

00:33:56.743 --> 00:33:58.411
Something urgent came up.

00:33:58.494 --> 00:34:00.288
Something urgent? Like what?

00:34:01.289 --> 00:34:03.166
What made you leave without a word?

00:34:03.249 --> 00:34:04.500
It's my mom.

00:34:05.001 --> 00:34:06.711
She suddenly needs the car.

00:34:08.046 --> 00:34:09.881
Didn't you tell her you'd be using it?

00:34:10.882 --> 00:34:12.258
No, that's not it.

00:34:13.009 --> 00:34:15.553
Eun-jung, I'm driving now.
I'll call you later.

00:34:16.054 --> 00:34:18.848
Okay, sure. Call me.

00:34:40.286 --> 00:34:42.163
-The pizza's so good.
-Help yourself.

00:34:42.246 --> 00:34:43.331
Just wait a bit longer.

00:34:43.414 --> 00:34:45.583
Where's Sang-hak? The pizza's all cold.

00:34:46.084 --> 00:34:48.669
Something urgent came up at home,
so I told him to go.

00:34:48.753 --> 00:34:51.506
-What?
-He just went home?

00:34:51.589 --> 00:34:54.717
Yes. He says he'll call
when he gets the chance.

00:34:54.801 --> 00:34:56.302
Did something bad happen?

00:34:56.385 --> 00:34:58.471
No, not exactly…

00:34:58.554 --> 00:35:00.681
Maybe he took his dad's car
without permission.

00:35:01.599 --> 00:35:02.683
As if.

00:35:02.767 --> 00:35:05.394
Does that mean
I can take Sang-hak's portion home?

00:35:05.478 --> 00:35:06.771
Do you think I'd let you?

00:35:06.854 --> 00:35:09.607
-Whoops.
-Hyeong-kyu, you should have some too.

00:35:13.653 --> 00:35:15.154
What would you do…

00:35:17.198 --> 00:35:18.658
if you were me?

00:35:20.034 --> 00:35:22.870
Should I meet with Moonee's sister?

00:35:25.540 --> 00:35:26.415
Would Moonee…

00:35:31.087 --> 00:35:35.591
Do you think he would want Sang-yeon
to know about this?

00:35:36.968 --> 00:35:41.556
Moonee always… wanted to tell her.

00:35:43.015 --> 00:35:45.643
My worry isn't about
honoring Moonee's wishes.

00:35:50.022 --> 00:35:51.524
I worry how Moonee's sister…

00:35:55.611 --> 00:35:57.321
may take the news.

00:36:05.496 --> 00:36:08.166
Sang-yeon! Cheon Sang-yeon!

00:36:09.292 --> 00:36:12.545
Sang-yeon! Cheon Sang-yeon!

00:37:18.236 --> 00:37:19.320
Dear Dylan,

00:37:21.113 --> 00:37:26.285
I think I've always waited in fear
for that day to come.

00:37:27.411 --> 00:37:28.871
The day someone

00:37:30.665 --> 00:37:32.208
would find me out.

00:37:38.047 --> 00:37:41.217
I remember thinking,
"So this is what it feels like."

00:37:42.260 --> 00:37:46.639
"This is how unbearably scary
this burden can be."

00:37:56.732 --> 00:37:57.775
Moonee.

00:38:01.654 --> 00:38:02.780
Have you eaten?

00:38:04.991 --> 00:38:06.951
Let's eat together if you haven't.

00:38:11.664 --> 00:38:14.542
On that day,
you were more than just a friend.

00:38:17.628 --> 00:38:20.131
You gave me

00:38:21.382 --> 00:38:23.801
a world in which I was allowed to exist.

00:38:24.343 --> 00:38:27.263
All I did was walk with Moonee…

00:38:30.641 --> 00:38:35.187
but Moonee described it
as having been given the world.

00:39:28.908 --> 00:39:30.409
Thank you for the pizza.

00:39:30.493 --> 00:39:31.994
-Don't mention it.
-Yeah, thanks.

00:39:32.078 --> 00:39:33.537
-Thank you.
-It's nothing.

00:39:33.621 --> 00:39:35.331
Your girlfriend isn't even here,

00:39:35.414 --> 00:39:37.625
but you brought pizza
and helped clean up. Thanks.

00:39:37.708 --> 00:39:40.252
It was fun. I had a lot of fun, everyone.

00:39:40.336 --> 00:39:41.921
-That's good.
-Thank you.

00:39:43.964 --> 00:39:45.424
Do you play the guitar?

00:39:46.092 --> 00:39:49.011
Yes. I did for a while when I was younger.

00:39:49.095 --> 00:39:51.097
-That explains your photo here.
-Yes.

00:39:51.764 --> 00:39:54.183
My friend's actually a guitarist.

00:39:54.266 --> 00:39:55.226
He is?

00:39:55.309 --> 00:39:57.812
The guy who dropped out of school
to be in a band?

00:39:57.895 --> 00:40:00.398
He's a professional now.
His band's pretty famous too.

00:40:00.481 --> 00:40:02.400
Which famous band?

00:40:02.483 --> 00:40:04.110
They're called Like.Flying.

00:40:04.610 --> 00:40:07.154
Do you know them?
I'll get you all invites sometime.

00:40:07.238 --> 00:40:09.990
He's left-handed,
and his strumming technique is awesome.

00:40:10.074 --> 00:40:12.493
-That would be great.
-I'll invite you all.

00:40:12.576 --> 00:40:15.329
I was blown away
by his left-handed strumming technique.

00:40:23.546 --> 00:40:25.548
Ms. Yoon. It's me, Eun-jung.

00:40:26.424 --> 00:40:28.634
Is Sang-yeon with you, by any chance?

00:40:42.106 --> 00:40:44.316
The number you have dialed is unavailable.

00:40:55.995 --> 00:40:57.455
-Good night.
-Okay.

00:41:25.649 --> 00:41:26.942
Answer the phone.

00:42:10.194 --> 00:42:13.239
The number you have dialed
is currently unavailable.

00:42:13.322 --> 00:42:15.699
Please leave a message after the tone.

00:42:27.378 --> 00:42:29.213
Did you hear about it too?

00:42:30.673 --> 00:42:31.924
About my brother.

00:42:35.427 --> 00:42:36.262
Yes.

00:42:39.682 --> 00:42:41.058
So that's why you came.

00:42:46.355 --> 00:42:48.065
Because you knew.

00:42:52.236 --> 00:42:54.905
What did you tell Eun-jung
before coming here?

00:42:57.491 --> 00:42:58.576
I couldn't tell her.

00:43:04.498 --> 00:43:07.209
I'll tell her later myself.

00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:47.750
I shouldn't have made you eat.

00:43:51.629 --> 00:43:54.548
Not at all. I was hungry anyway.

00:43:58.260 --> 00:44:02.348
Now that I've had this,
I'll be able to digest everything.

00:44:18.155 --> 00:44:19.615
Look at all the stars.

00:44:33.212 --> 00:44:34.880
If I think about it now…

00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:41.303
there were plenty of signs.

00:44:45.557 --> 00:44:46.725
About my brother.

00:44:56.110 --> 00:44:58.320
I don't even know how…

00:45:02.449 --> 00:45:03.826
I could have missed it.

00:45:07.162 --> 00:45:09.164
That's Sang-yeon. Adorable, isn't she?

00:45:09.873 --> 00:45:11.291
That was Moonee?

00:45:15.129 --> 00:45:16.255
Did you think it was me?

00:45:18.674 --> 00:45:23.387
It was him when he was in preschool.

00:45:28.475 --> 00:45:33.647
He loved to play with dolls.

00:45:35.566 --> 00:45:40.112
But Dad ignored all that
and sent him to a soccer club.

00:45:42.322 --> 00:45:43.407
Saying that boys

00:45:45.033 --> 00:45:48.912
should be raised
among other sweaty little boys.

00:45:52.708 --> 00:45:55.252
When he'd have a tantrum and refuse to go…

00:46:11.852 --> 00:46:12.978
my dad would beat him.

00:46:45.427 --> 00:46:51.517
SENDER
PRIVATE KIM SANG-HAK

00:46:52.935 --> 00:46:53.936
Seonbae.

00:46:56.271 --> 00:46:57.481
You should go first.

00:46:59.191 --> 00:47:01.318
There's somewhere I need to go.

00:47:59.751 --> 00:48:02.921
You should have woken me.
Why didn't you wake me?

00:48:04.047 --> 00:48:05.215
We just arrived.

00:48:10.679 --> 00:48:12.556
Sorry you had to drive all the way here.

00:48:13.557 --> 00:48:14.391
It's fine.

00:48:16.602 --> 00:48:17.436
Go inside.

00:48:19.021 --> 00:48:20.355
Drive safe.

00:48:46.798 --> 00:48:48.550
-Ryu Eun-jung.
-Eun-jung!

00:48:48.634 --> 00:48:50.385
Hey, guys!

00:48:51.553 --> 00:48:52.387
Wow, flowers.

00:48:52.471 --> 00:48:55.766
Why get her flowers?
She's too busy for us these days.

00:48:55.849 --> 00:48:57.893
Ignore her. She helped pick them out.

00:48:58.477 --> 00:49:00.228
These are yours, aren't they?

00:49:01.647 --> 00:49:04.066
Look at you two. What a dashing couple.

00:49:05.567 --> 00:49:09.738
Attention, everyone. We will be holding
a brief opening event shortly.

00:49:09.821 --> 00:49:13.867
What? Already?
But we're still missing two people.

00:49:13.951 --> 00:49:15.494
Please go ahead and start.

00:49:15.577 --> 00:49:16.411
Okay.

00:49:17.496 --> 00:49:18.330
How come?

00:49:18.413 --> 00:49:22.209
He went to Cheonan,
so I don't think he'll make it today.

00:49:22.292 --> 00:49:23.961
And Sang-yeon's still in Gangneung.

00:49:24.044 --> 00:49:26.046
Cheonan? Isn't he in the military?

00:49:26.129 --> 00:49:27.297
He's out on leave.

00:49:27.381 --> 00:49:29.091
Isn't Sang-yeon coming today?

00:49:29.174 --> 00:49:30.550
She's at her mom's.

00:49:31.051 --> 00:49:33.971
I wanted to see
how much prettier she'd gotten.

00:49:36.598 --> 00:49:38.600
What? Cheonan?

00:49:39.518 --> 00:49:41.645
Yeah, at his grandfather's…

00:49:47.985 --> 00:49:51.947
What are you doing here?
You said you'd be in Cheonan today.

00:49:52.990 --> 00:49:53.824
Right.

00:49:54.866 --> 00:49:57.160
Sorry I took off like that yesterday.

00:49:58.120 --> 00:49:59.371
Long time no see.

00:49:59.454 --> 00:50:01.081
Long time no see. You too, Ju-eun.

00:50:01.164 --> 00:50:02.708
I see you stayed out last night.

00:50:04.001 --> 00:50:06.586
Nonsense.
I told you he was at his grandfather's.

00:50:06.670 --> 00:50:10.716
I know. I was just teasing.
He's in his clothes from yesterday.

00:50:11.216 --> 00:50:13.093
I was nursing my grandpa. Satisfied?

00:50:13.176 --> 00:50:16.179
That would explain
why you look so gaunt today.

00:50:21.560 --> 00:50:24.021
Look at this. It's from Na-mi and Ju-eun.

00:50:25.856 --> 00:50:27.941
They're pretty. Thanks.

00:50:28.984 --> 00:50:30.277
-Aren't they?
-Yeah.

00:50:31.028 --> 00:50:31.987
Look around.

00:50:36.074 --> 00:50:37.284
Look over there too.

00:50:46.084 --> 00:50:47.544
I don't want to hear it.

00:50:58.680 --> 00:51:00.557
I smiled all day.

00:51:01.975 --> 00:51:07.606
I smiled, laughed,
and smiled a little more.

00:51:09.399 --> 00:51:10.734
And for some reason,

00:51:12.110 --> 00:51:13.737
I was reminded of that day.

00:51:14.237 --> 00:51:15.113
Ryu Eun-jung.

00:51:16.990 --> 00:51:17.824
Eun-jung?

00:51:22.037 --> 00:51:24.039
Perhaps it was because all the shame…

00:51:29.711 --> 00:51:33.590
and all the doubts
I had silently brushed off as foolishness…

00:51:36.051 --> 00:51:38.887
had ultimately turned out to be valid.

00:51:57.739 --> 00:52:01.868
As if by magic,
Sang-hak seonbae was standing there.

00:52:03.286 --> 00:52:06.248
I had just been thinking about him

00:52:07.749 --> 00:52:12.045
when he suddenly called out my name.

00:52:13.964 --> 00:52:18.760
And that was how
our unforgettable night began.

00:52:24.683 --> 00:52:27.310
HOW IS IT THAT HE MAKES ME SO HAPPY,
YET HE CAN'T BE MINE?

00:52:27.394 --> 00:52:29.312
I CONFESSED TO HIM
THAT I LIKED UNCLE TAT.

00:52:36.987 --> 00:52:38.655
-Eun-jung.
-Don't touch me.

00:52:38.738 --> 00:52:40.866
Eun-jung! Stop, please.

00:52:50.041 --> 00:52:51.543
Let me ask you one thing.

00:52:53.420 --> 00:52:54.880
Did you turn your phone off?

00:52:56.965 --> 00:53:00.927
-Eun-jung--
-Did you turn it off yourself?

00:53:08.059 --> 00:53:09.102
Yes, I did.

00:53:16.985 --> 00:53:17.819
Why?

00:53:23.158 --> 00:53:24.910
There was nothing I could say.

00:53:41.343 --> 00:53:42.469
There was nothing…

00:53:44.971 --> 00:53:45.805
you could say?

00:53:45.889 --> 00:53:47.307
I went to Jecheon…

00:53:52.479 --> 00:53:53.772
to find Sang-yeon.

00:54:14.251 --> 00:54:15.961
Did she ask you to go see her?

00:54:17.671 --> 00:54:18.505
No.

00:54:20.507 --> 00:54:21.716
I went there myself.

00:54:28.682 --> 00:54:29.516
Why?

00:54:35.397 --> 00:54:36.231
Sang-hak.

00:54:41.861 --> 00:54:43.196
Do you like her?

00:54:45.365 --> 00:54:47.826
-Eun-jung…
-If not, why can't you answer me?

00:54:50.328 --> 00:54:53.540
Why couldn't you tell me
that you were in Jecheon with her?

00:54:56.584 --> 00:54:58.336
Why turn your phone off?

00:54:58.837 --> 00:54:59.879
Sang-yeon should tell--

00:54:59.963 --> 00:55:01.798
Don't use her as an excuse!

00:55:11.641 --> 00:55:13.560
I'm asking you about your feelings.

00:55:49.888 --> 00:55:51.556
Why did you apply for leave?

00:55:54.100 --> 00:55:56.186
It wasn't because of the exhibit, was it?

00:55:58.980 --> 00:56:03.735
Please just tell me
why you did that to me.

00:56:10.200 --> 00:56:11.618
I think I was wavering.

00:56:19.209 --> 00:56:20.043
What?

00:56:24.631 --> 00:56:25.965
My heart was shaken…

00:56:31.638 --> 00:56:32.639
by Sang-yeon.

00:57:04.546 --> 00:57:05.755
Let's end it here, then.

01:00:30.627 --> 01:00:35.632
