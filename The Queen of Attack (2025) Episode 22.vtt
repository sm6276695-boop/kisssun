00:00:06.016 --> 00:00:10.400
=The Queen of Attack=

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.324
=Episode 22=

00:00:14.483 --> 00:00:17.392
(Two hours ago)

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.360
You... You lied to me.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.600
There was never any antidote.

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.000
You'll never get your face back.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.000
I'm the former Crown Prince.

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:02.480
This identity of mine

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.840
dragged me
into a life-or-death predicament.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:07.520
At a royal banquet,

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.600
someone poisoned me with Gu poison.

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:11.400
By the time I realized it,

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.080
every inch of my skin
began tearing apart

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.800
and festering.

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:16.840
I learned medicine

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.040
under renowned physicians.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.080
With my last shred of willpower,

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.040
I ordered my most trusted subordinate

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.040
to take me to my master's hermitage.

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.960
Through studying ancient texts,

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.400
I discovered a vicious
self-preservation method.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.600
Fighting poison with poison.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:34.440
By biting others,

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.120
to transfer the poison out,

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.160
thereby reducing my own poison.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.000
Who was that monster then?

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:45.720
He was that subordinate,

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:48.920
Shentu Yu.

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.640
He sacrificed himself to save me.

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.840
After part of my poison
transferred to him,

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.080
his appearance and physique
changed completely.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:58.640
The captors

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.240
mistook him for the Gu-poisoned me

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:02.840
and imprisoned him.

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.960
As for me,

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.000
I lived in seclusion as Shentu Yu.

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.240
So that's what happened.

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:14.880
Who would've thought

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.000
the former Crown Prince

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.280
has been living safe and sound
all these years.

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.280
What an incredible story.

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:27.720
It was you.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.840
You're the one who poisoned me

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.360
at that royal banquet, aren't you?

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:33.520
Correct.

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.400
Eliminating you ensured
His Majesty's smooth ascension.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.880
Yet he only granted me
a County Princess title.

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.320
While those men without merit

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.080
or capabilities inherit noble titles.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.880
This isn't how the royal family
should operate!

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:49.680
Where's Hong Linlang now?

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.920
Finally,

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.680
it's all coming to an end.

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:06.360
Yes,

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:08.520
everything is about to end.

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.000
You...

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.000
This needle is useless.

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.840
You...

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.640
You dare scheme against me?

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.080
Your Highness.

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:34.320
Stop deluding yourself.

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:36.160
This is the mansion.

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.120
You can't escape.

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:39.120
True,

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.600
this is the mansion.

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:43.040
But I

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.120
am the Consort.

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:50.200
You're just a titular Consort.

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.200
Who would listen to you?

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:52.960
Indeed.

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.080
My Consort title is nominal.

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:56.120
Then

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:57.600
what about Prince Rui?

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:11.520
I haven't requested yet.

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.600
How could His Majesty
grant him the title?

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.920
You helped eliminate
the former Crown Prince,

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:18.880
and grew arrogant with achievements.

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.240
Even as the County Princess,
you remain dissatisfied.

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:25.720
Do you think His Majesty
wants to protect you?

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.880
He's eager to find any excuse

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.240
to make you disappear forever.

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:36.080
Seize them!

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.720
Let me go!

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:38.960
- Move!
- Let go of me!

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:00.040
I know you're in there.

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:29.680
What a pity.

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:31.800
You should've seen

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:34.400
those wounds,

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:39.160
and the flesh torn open by whips

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:42.200
and seared with red-hot irons,

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:44.840
making sizzling sound...

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.760
I can't even feel pain anymore.

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:56.760
Only this face...

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:00.240
What a waste.

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:03.360
This face!

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:30.880
Father,

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:32.320
Mother,

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:35.240
I've avenged

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:38.440
all your grievances for you.

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:41.000
Now,

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:44.520
you may rest in peace.

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:06.320
Let's go.

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:25.280
Was I wrong?

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:46.080
I wasn't wrong.

00:08:00.531 --> 00:08:01.698
(Prince Rui's Mansion)

00:08:01.698 --> 00:08:04.698
(Prince Xiao Xian submitted a petition.)

00:08:04.698 --> 00:08:09.368
(Lin Hong'er's murder case reopened.)

00:08:09.368 --> 00:08:14.048
(Truth revealed, perpetrators punished.)

00:08:14.048 --> 00:08:16.320
(Ruoya Residence)

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:22.080
I haven't seen such clear sky for long.

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:24.800
I want to gaze properly.

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:27.600
You and His Majesty

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:30.080
must have made quite a few deals.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:34.840
In times of chaos,

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:35.968
imperial power is unstable.

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:37.200
He'll always need

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:39.760
supportive allies by his side.

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:45.000
Master Shentu told me

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:47.520
to stand by His Majesty

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:49.184
and protect the nation and its people.

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:50.320
From now on,

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:52.520
you shall be Prince Rui.

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:56.000
Yes,

00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:57.760
my Consort.

00:08:58.920 --> 00:08:59.840
Have you forgotten?

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:02.040
You petitioned His Majesty

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:03.320
to clear my name.

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:06.480
I'm no longer Hong Linlang,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.440
nor the Consort.

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:11.560
I'm just Lin Hong'er.

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:17.280
So...

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:19.720
Are you leaving?

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:22.480
With him?

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:25.320
He and I

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:28.240
are like two wandering clouds
in the martial world,

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:30.480
never destined to linger
under the same sky.
