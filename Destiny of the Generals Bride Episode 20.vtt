00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:12.020
=Episode 20=

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:20.400
Ruthless bandit and villainous commoner

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.679
dared to kidnap my Zhaoping.

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:23.140
(Zhaoping Princess is in my hands,
demand 500 taels of gold,)

00:00:23.152 --> 00:00:23.760
(or her life won't be spared.)

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.519
And they want 500 taels of gold.

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.359
Your Highness, forgive me.

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:29.399
I shall go gather the gold immediately.

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:30.719
We must ensure

00:00:30.719 --> 00:00:33.119
that Princess returns safely.

00:00:34.759 --> 00:00:35.439
Qing Yan.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.799
Princess has already
given you so much gold,

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.759
if not used now, then when?

00:00:40.679 --> 00:00:42.799
Your Highness, I believe

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.759
this gold should not be given.

00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:46.159
Not give it?

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.000
Do you want them to kill Princess?

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.280
I knew you were tough-hearted,

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.159
but I never thought for a little money,

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:55.159
you'd even risk the Princess's life.

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:58.679
Your Highness, this wicked woman
refuses to give the gold.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.119
She must be colluding with the bandits.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.520
Why not arrest her now

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.560
and interrogate her harshly?

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.239
See if she confesses or not.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.159
Guards!

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.400
Let's see who dares touch her!

00:01:07.959 --> 00:01:08.799
All of you, down!

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:09.760
Yes.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:10.599
Each of you,

00:01:10.879 --> 00:01:12.319
instead of catching the thieves outside,

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:13.640
you catch your own people

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:15.000
and quite familiar with this.

00:01:17.239 --> 00:01:20.719
Qing Yan,
you always have your own ideas.

00:01:20.959 --> 00:01:22.359
Please make yourself clear.

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.959
Why can't this gold be handed over?

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.760
Your Highness, you are high in the court,

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:31.920
and do not understand
the ways of the world.

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:34.120
An ordinary woman gets kidnapped,

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:36.719
the ransom is usually
only ten or 20 taels.

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.040
Even if she's beautiful

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.159
and of high status,

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:41.719
30 taels is already the limit.

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:45.159
Now these bandits dare
to demand 500 taels,

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:46.280
I think

00:01:46.599 --> 00:01:49.000
they must know
Princess's true identity.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:50.519
If so,

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.120
is it a good thing or a bad thing?

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:56.000
It's obviously a huge disaster.

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.560
The Princess is the daughter
of the true dragon.

00:01:58.799 --> 00:01:59.879
Once released,

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.480
the entire nation will pursue the bandits.

00:02:02.879 --> 00:02:04.879
With the Princess's description

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.599
and precise tracking,

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.000
the bandits will have no escape.

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:12.199
Your Highness, if you were the bandits

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:13.599
and got the gold,

00:02:13.919 --> 00:02:16.159
would you release her or not?

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.319
So, once we release the gold,

00:02:24.719 --> 00:02:27.319
Zhaoping will be doomed.

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:28.159
Exactly.

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:34.319
So, what should we do?

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:36.199
We can send a signal

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:38.439
to make the bandits think

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:40.520
that the one they captured
is not the real princess.

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:42.759
Then Princess may
have a chance to survive.

00:02:43.719 --> 00:02:44.680
How do we do that?

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:46.319
We spread the rumor

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.520
that Princess will return
to the palace in one day.

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.960
You dare impersonate the princess

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:04.199
and deceive me?

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:05.759
Do you want to die?

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.960
I am Zhaoping Princess of Great Yu.

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:09.360
No need to pretend.

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:11.360
You are the princess?

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.879
You are the princess?

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:14.039
I am the Retired Emperor.

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.759
You...

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:19.039
Princess Zhaoping will leave
with Empress Dowager today

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:20.800
to return to the palace.

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:22.120
Impossible.

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:24.319
Grandmother won't leave me behind.

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:27.400
Who exactly are you?

00:03:28.719 --> 00:03:32.199
I am Zhaoping Princess of Great Yu.

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:38.960
Boss, what should we do? Whom to trust?

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.759
The princess and Empress Dowager
depart for the palace.

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:48.159
Did you see it clearly?

00:03:48.719 --> 00:03:49.120
I...

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:50.759
I just heard about it,

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:51.599
didn't see it myself.

00:03:54.719 --> 00:03:55.439
Go check!

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:56.800
Go see!

00:03:56.919 --> 00:03:57.439
Yes.

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:07.840
The bandits will doubt when they hear

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.000
the princess is returning

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:10.599
and come to check.

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:12.680
We will arrange the crowd in advance.

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:14.560
Only select the women

00:04:14.719 --> 00:04:17.079
and men shorter than five feet to watch.

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:18.480
This way,

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:20.839
if a tall and strong man appears,

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:22.639
he must be one of the bandits.

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:31.800
Boss!

00:04:31.959 --> 00:04:32.720
I've seen it clearly.

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:33.639
That princess indeed...

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.319
Who exactly is she? Speak!

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:04.720
Qing Yan asked me to give this to you.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.279
Why didn't she come herself?

00:05:13.079 --> 00:05:14.360
That's just how she is.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.160
When there's something important,

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:17.800
she goes first,

00:05:18.279 --> 00:05:20.800
but once it's over, she hides.

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:22.600
Letting others take the credit.

00:05:25.439 --> 00:05:27.360
I still remember the first time
I met you,

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:30.560
you went alone into the enemy camp

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:31.959
and rescued me.

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:34.199
I had intended

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:35.839
to return to Great Yu

00:05:36.519 --> 00:05:37.800
and thank you properly.

00:05:39.279 --> 00:05:40.879
But you didn't give me the chance.

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:43.240
You left quietly without a word.

00:05:44.319 --> 00:05:45.399
Since that moment,

00:05:46.439 --> 00:05:48.279
I felt you were different from others.

00:05:52.319 --> 00:05:53.240
I never thought

00:05:54.759 --> 00:05:56.439
you learned from your wife.

00:05:58.439 --> 00:06:00.360
Qing Yan indeed taught me a lot.

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:04.360
Since she saved me,

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:07.639
it would be unfair to compete
with her for you.

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:09.920
That would be inhumane.

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:11.759
I know all this

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:13.240
was not her intention.

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:16.560
But she did almost kill me.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.279
It is an honor

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:22.160
that Your Highness appreciates me.

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:23.560
But this is only

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:24.959
a fleeting feeling.

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:27.120
Perhaps soon

00:06:28.079 --> 00:06:29.560
when the Princess thinks of me again,

00:06:29.839 --> 00:06:30.839
you will only feel

00:06:31.199 --> 00:06:32.920
I am just an ordinary person.

00:06:35.759 --> 00:06:36.560
No.

00:06:37.199 --> 00:06:38.160
You are different.

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:40.319
How different?

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:43.839
You are highly skilled in martial arts

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:46.720
and you know how to cherish women.

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:48.959
You don't judge by appearance.

00:06:50.199 --> 00:06:51.560
I was injured on my face.

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:53.560
Originally,

00:06:53.959 --> 00:06:55.759
I planned to become a recluse,

00:06:56.439 --> 00:06:57.360
hide away

00:06:58.319 --> 00:06:59.399
and never see anyone again.

00:07:00.319 --> 00:07:01.519
It was you who told me

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:04.480
I don't need to hide my scars,

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.519
nor see them as ugly.

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:07.839
Instead,

00:07:08.199 --> 00:07:10.240
I should see them as my honor.

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:13.720
Because with my own marriage,

00:07:14.279 --> 00:07:17.040
I brought five years of peace to my people.

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:19.560
From that moment,

00:07:20.279 --> 00:07:23.360
I decided that if it were not you,

00:07:24.839 --> 00:07:26.439
I would never marry again.

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:30.560
I see.

00:07:37.199 --> 00:07:38.439
I have many

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:40.920
scars like these on my body.

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:42.959
I once

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:45.560
also wanted to hide away,

00:07:46.839 --> 00:07:48.160
it was Qing Yan who told me

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:52.000
these scars are not ugly,

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:53.720
no need to hide.

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:55.879
They are my honor.

00:07:56.439 --> 00:07:57.800
Because I used my body

00:07:58.600 --> 00:07:59.959
to protect my country

00:08:01.399 --> 00:08:02.480
and those I love.

00:08:12.199 --> 00:08:13.399
I originally thought

00:08:14.879 --> 00:08:16.279
if it weren't for Qing Yan,

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:19.920
the two of us could be together.

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:25.000
But I didn't expect

00:08:26.399 --> 00:08:27.759
without Qing Yan,

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:32.320
I might not have fallen for you at all.

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:37.159
Do I love you

00:08:39.279 --> 00:08:41.519
or the shadow of her I see in you?

00:08:43.399 --> 00:08:44.480
You go down first.

00:08:45.519 --> 00:08:47.000
I want to be alone for a while.

00:09:01.039 --> 00:09:03.039
May all evildoers in this world

00:09:03.879 --> 00:09:05.600
receive the punishment they deserve.

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:07.919
May Princess Zhaoping

00:09:08.559 --> 00:09:11.200
soon overcome the terror.

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:26.639
I once thought

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:28.279
that marrying Xiao Yun

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:30.080
was your fortune.

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:31.960
But now it seems

00:09:32.919 --> 00:09:33.960
it's the opposite.

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:43.360
Xiao Yun marrying you

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:45.720
is his fortune.

00:09:49.519 --> 00:09:51.080
Your Highness, you flatter me.

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:54.960
It's just a pity you are not a man.

00:09:55.639 --> 00:09:58.320
Otherwise, I would never
have fallen for Xiao Yun.

00:09:58.559 --> 00:09:59.759
He wouldn't even have a chance.

00:10:01.879 --> 00:10:04.559
Your Highness, I don't understand
what you mean.

00:10:06.679 --> 00:10:08.159
You are indeed remarkable.

00:10:08.679 --> 00:10:10.360
Do you have any brothers at home?

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:13.799
No, I am the only daughter.

00:10:16.639 --> 00:10:18.480
Then what am I to do?

00:10:22.679 --> 00:10:24.360
I only regret that you are a woman,

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:27.000
yet in my heart,

00:10:27.919 --> 00:10:30.240
I can never care for any other man.

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:32.679
You…

00:10:33.879 --> 00:10:34.480
Your Highness.

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:37.600
Seeing you so frightened,

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:39.519
I feel I've regained some honor.

00:10:40.879 --> 00:10:41.720
But

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:44.000
I am still a bit fearful.

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:46.960
I almost truly harmed you by mistake.

00:10:48.919 --> 00:10:50.159
From what Your Highness says,

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:52.559
you don't plan to marry Xiao Yun?

00:10:54.799 --> 00:10:55.879
I only realized today

00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:58.600
that the one I loved was never Xiao Yun,

00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:01.159
but the shadow of you that fell on him.

00:11:02.519 --> 00:11:04.360
Since we cannot be sisters-in-law,

00:11:04.799 --> 00:11:06.960
would you be willing
to be my sister instead?
