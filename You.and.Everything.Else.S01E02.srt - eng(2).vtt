00:00:13.722 --> 00:00:15.140
Are things…

00:00:18.893 --> 00:00:21.187
really so bad

00:00:22.522 --> 00:00:24.024
that you're thinking of doing this?

00:00:24.107 --> 00:00:25.775
I'm not "thinking."

00:00:28.111 --> 00:00:31.031
I've already made my decision.

00:00:37.078 --> 00:00:39.956
They don't just let anyone
go ahead with this,

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.710
and I thought long and hard
before making the decision.

00:00:47.422 --> 00:00:50.133
Even if you don't come with me,

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:52.719
I will be going.

00:00:56.264 --> 00:00:57.307
But…

00:00:59.517 --> 00:01:00.643
I…

00:01:03.438 --> 00:01:05.982
would like for you to come with me.

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.207
How can you call me after ten years

00:01:23.416 --> 00:01:24.417
and ask me to--

00:01:24.501 --> 00:01:26.544
How could I have called you

00:01:27.962 --> 00:01:30.215
if it weren't for something like this?

00:01:34.385 --> 00:01:35.762
I have exactly…

00:01:37.555 --> 00:01:38.389
one month left.

00:01:39.015 --> 00:01:40.892
Who decided on a month?

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:45.980
You did, didn't you?

00:01:50.235 --> 00:01:52.487
-Eun-jung.
-I'm afraid…

00:01:55.448 --> 00:01:56.783
I can't grant your favor.

00:02:06.751 --> 00:02:07.836
What you're doing…

00:02:10.213 --> 00:02:12.173
is emotional abuse.

00:02:14.384 --> 00:02:15.343
You should know that.

00:02:18.972 --> 00:02:20.056
Eun-jung.

00:02:43.413 --> 00:02:45.874
How was your meeting with Ms. Cheon?

00:02:47.083 --> 00:02:50.211
Fine. But I don't think
I can work on that script.

00:02:50.712 --> 00:02:52.630
Let's keep looking for something to adapt.

00:03:32.253 --> 00:03:36.174
YOU AND EVERYTHING ELSE

00:03:58.071 --> 00:04:02.742
HOW TO DEAL WITH CANCER
WHAT CANCER MEANS TO ME

00:04:18.633 --> 00:04:19.467
Hello?

00:04:21.177 --> 00:04:23.471
CERTIFICATE OF REGISTERED ASSETS
PROPERTIES

00:04:23.554 --> 00:04:26.641
PROPERTY OWNER
CHEON SANG-YEON

00:04:28.685 --> 00:04:29.769
What is this?

00:04:30.478 --> 00:04:33.606
The building that
Ms. Cheon will be gifting you.

00:04:35.608 --> 00:04:36.693
"Gifting"?

00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:40.738
I understand
that this is quite surprising.

00:04:40.822 --> 00:04:43.866
This building in Seongsu
is worth around 13 billion won.

00:04:44.367 --> 00:04:48.079
This is what the building looks like.
A beauty, isn't it?

00:04:48.162 --> 00:04:52.208
Income generated from rent is guaranteed
to be 40 million won per month.

00:04:55.295 --> 00:04:58.840
To be honest, I'm a little jealous.
You're lucky to have a friend who--

00:04:58.923 --> 00:05:01.426
Was this the urgent matter you mentioned

00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:05.263
that you said
we couldn't discuss on the phone?

00:05:09.851 --> 00:05:12.020
I'm taking up too much of your time,
aren't I?

00:05:12.103 --> 00:05:15.982
I can explain the important details
another time, but for now,

00:05:16.065 --> 00:05:19.152
please send me a copy
of your resident registration…

00:05:20.737 --> 00:05:21.571
Ms. Ryu?

00:05:22.196 --> 00:05:24.407
The number you are calling is currently--

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:27.660
Where is Ms. Cheon right now?

00:05:28.328 --> 00:05:33.291
I'm afraid it's not great timing.
She's too unwell to meet anyone right now.

00:05:37.086 --> 00:05:38.671
How bad is she?

00:05:42.258 --> 00:05:43.926
You can't just turn up like this.

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:46.596
I don't plan on seeing her face-to-face.
Don't worry.

00:05:47.096 --> 00:05:48.014
Where is she?

00:05:57.231 --> 00:05:58.858
It's me. Eun-jung.

00:06:00.068 --> 00:06:03.863
Why bother me if you won't even face me
when you're sick?

00:06:04.614 --> 00:06:06.657
Let's just live our lives
as we always have.

00:06:07.408 --> 00:06:09.118
Don't ever contact me again.

00:06:10.161 --> 00:06:11.371
And get treatment.

00:06:19.212 --> 00:06:22.256
I don't know what's making me so angry.

00:06:24.092 --> 00:06:26.219
Is it the tax accountant's rashness?

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:31.891
Or is it Sang-yeon's stubbornness
not to show herself in her weakness?

00:06:33.184 --> 00:06:34.727
Or is it this feeling

00:06:35.645 --> 00:06:37.188
of helplessness?

00:06:39.148 --> 00:06:40.483
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL EPISODE

00:06:40.566 --> 00:06:44.237
THIS SHORT MIDDLE SCHOOL KID WOULD,
THREE YEARS LATER, BECOME MY FIRST LOVE

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:47.115
And so I write.

00:06:49.951 --> 00:06:51.911
However this story may unfold…

00:06:51.994 --> 00:06:53.329
1996, SECOND YEAR OF MIDDLE SCHOOL

00:06:53.413 --> 00:06:54.664
…let's not be scared.

00:06:55.832 --> 00:06:59.627
AT LAST, ON THE CORRIDOR BULLETIN…

00:07:08.177 --> 00:07:10.221
Whoa, tenth in the entire school!

00:07:11.222 --> 00:07:12.515
That's crazy.

00:07:12.598 --> 00:07:14.142
-Totally crazy.
-It's amazing!

00:07:14.225 --> 00:07:16.185
You're so annoying, Eun-jung.

00:07:16.269 --> 00:07:18.396
Why am I so smart
on top of everything else?

00:07:20.773 --> 00:07:22.525
Wow. 100.

00:07:23.109 --> 00:07:25.069
100? We're not in elementary school.

00:07:25.862 --> 00:07:27.738
A 100 average? She can't be human.

00:07:28.448 --> 00:07:29.824
You're not human either.

00:07:29.907 --> 00:07:32.618
True. How can you rank tenth
in the entire school?

00:07:37.206 --> 00:07:38.666
She didn't even bother to look.

00:07:39.167 --> 00:07:41.043
First is a given, huh?

00:07:47.008 --> 00:07:49.343
If you haven't paid
for the field trip yet, pay now.

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:51.637
Look at this!

00:07:52.388 --> 00:07:53.931
I told you not to copy me!

00:07:54.015 --> 00:07:55.975
-Look, H.O.T are--
-Let's compare the three.

00:07:56.559 --> 00:07:58.394
This one's not great,

00:07:58.478 --> 00:08:00.146
and these guys aren't H.O.T.

00:08:00.229 --> 00:08:02.857
-But these guys from Sechskies--
-Be real. He's the best.

00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:04.150
No. Look here.

00:08:05.026 --> 00:08:06.861
Mrs. Jang.

00:08:06.944 --> 00:08:07.904
I apologize.

00:08:08.654 --> 00:08:12.200
The stove suddenly broke this morning,
so I needed to pay for repairs.

00:08:13.576 --> 00:08:15.495
Everyone has their own problems.

00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:19.040
Tomorrow, I expect full payment
of the overdue interest.

00:08:19.999 --> 00:08:21.167
I'm sorry.

00:08:21.667 --> 00:08:22.668
I'm sorry!

00:08:27.423 --> 00:08:28.925
I'm home!

00:08:29.008 --> 00:08:29.967
There you are.

00:08:31.302 --> 00:08:33.429
Did you get your report card?

00:08:35.473 --> 00:08:36.557
What is it?

00:08:37.141 --> 00:08:38.392
You didn't do well?

00:08:45.525 --> 00:08:46.734
Ryu Eun-jung!

00:08:46.817 --> 00:08:49.278
Hooray! Goodness gracious!

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:52.365
What to do?

00:08:52.865 --> 00:08:56.244
-You placed tenth, so--
-You don't need to buy me a computer.

00:08:57.537 --> 00:08:58.371
Why not?

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:02.542
You've been nagging me about
how our family's the only one without one.

00:09:02.625 --> 00:09:05.878
It's fine. I'll buy one
when there's a better model.

00:09:07.088 --> 00:09:08.714
Still, I made you a promise.

00:09:08.798 --> 00:09:11.050
Then give me 20,000 won to buy clothes.

00:09:12.301 --> 00:09:13.803
-Clothes?
-Yeah.

00:09:13.886 --> 00:09:15.471
For the field trip talent show.

00:09:22.353 --> 00:09:26.107
If you keep trying to deceive me

00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:29.527
Thinking your charm is something unique

00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:33.739
I won't have any more love to give--

00:09:35.116 --> 00:09:38.119
Jeez, how are you guys so stiff?
Can't you do this?

00:09:38.202 --> 00:09:40.329
It's too hard.

00:09:40.413 --> 00:09:42.373
I told you to pick a song without dancers.

00:09:42.456 --> 00:09:46.210
How is this hard?
You just need to go around in a circle.

00:09:48.087 --> 00:09:50.339
Twist your body more. Like this.

00:09:51.299 --> 00:09:52.466
Like this?

00:09:54.552 --> 00:09:55.845
-Are you okay?
-Are you okay?

00:09:57.597 --> 00:10:00.224
Anyone want to dance
to Park Mi-kyung's "Eve's Warning"?

00:10:08.858 --> 00:10:10.109
I knew this would happen.

00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:12.570
Who would join at this stage?

00:10:14.405 --> 00:10:15.323
I'm sorry.

00:10:15.406 --> 00:10:16.490
Forget about it.

00:10:17.325 --> 00:10:19.243
It's not like you got hurt on purpose.

00:10:22.997 --> 00:10:24.498
Would you at least do it with me?

00:10:26.542 --> 00:10:27.793
Just me?

00:10:31.631 --> 00:10:34.925
How about Kang Soo-jee?
Her songs don't need backup dancers.

00:10:35.676 --> 00:10:39.347
-Kang Soo-jee is--
-Kang Soo-jee's pretty. And charming.

00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:42.141
You're right.
I think Son Jun-ho likes Kang Soo-jee too.

00:10:42.224 --> 00:10:43.267
Yeah.

00:10:47.229 --> 00:10:49.357
The way you approached me

00:10:51.025 --> 00:10:53.027
Like a violet haze…

00:10:54.028 --> 00:10:54.987
Let's go.

00:10:56.197 --> 00:10:57.156
Forget it.

00:10:57.239 --> 00:10:58.991
I even bought an outfit.

00:11:02.411 --> 00:11:03.245
I'll do it.

00:11:04.455 --> 00:11:05.289
You'll do it?

00:11:05.998 --> 00:11:06.832
Do what?

00:11:09.293 --> 00:11:10.711
Park Mi-kyung's backup dancer.

00:11:14.548 --> 00:11:16.676
You'll be a backup dancer?

00:11:36.112 --> 00:11:38.072
CUTIES

00:11:44.954 --> 00:11:50.000
Today, you avoid me again
You're up to no good

00:11:50.668 --> 00:11:52.253
But I know the truth

00:11:52.336 --> 00:11:55.923
If you know my feelings for you

00:11:56.006 --> 00:11:59.677
Don't be a fool and make any more mistakes

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:02.680
I, too, feel myself wavering

00:12:02.763 --> 00:12:06.100
When other great men tempt me

00:12:06.183 --> 00:12:09.645
If you keep trying to deceive me

00:12:09.729 --> 00:12:12.815
Thinking your charm is something unique

00:12:12.898 --> 00:12:17.528
I won't have any more love to give you

00:12:17.611 --> 00:12:23.576
I will just walk away

00:12:34.211 --> 00:12:35.713
Three, two, one!

00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:37.548
Do we look okay?

00:12:38.674 --> 00:12:40.885
-Let's pose for one together.
-How are we posing?

00:12:40.968 --> 00:12:43.137
-Peace signs?
-Actually, let's do this.

00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:44.889
Three, two, one!

00:12:46.432 --> 00:12:48.017
-Hey, Ryu Eun-jung!
-Yeah?

00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:49.894
-Aren't you coming?
-I am.

00:12:49.977 --> 00:12:50.978
One sec.

00:12:52.354 --> 00:12:54.148
Hurry, what should we do?

00:12:54.774 --> 00:12:56.192
-Let's take one together.
-What?

00:12:58.652 --> 00:13:01.238
-Can you take a photo of us?
-Let's huddle up.

00:13:06.035 --> 00:13:07.328
Okay, here goes.

00:13:07.411 --> 00:13:09.163
Three, two, one!

00:13:22.551 --> 00:13:23.552
What are you doing?

00:13:24.178 --> 00:13:25.805
What? Nothing.

00:13:35.523 --> 00:13:37.608
They're all my brother's. Pick one.

00:13:44.156 --> 00:13:46.492
I'd never seen a room like that before.

00:13:47.493 --> 00:13:49.620
A room with so much stuff.

00:14:02.383 --> 00:14:03.884
I wonder how they filmed that.

00:14:05.594 --> 00:14:08.347
It's because Barry Sonnenfeld
used to be a cinematographer.

00:14:09.265 --> 00:14:10.766
Barry… what?

00:14:11.475 --> 00:14:12.685
Barry Sonnenfeld.

00:14:14.645 --> 00:14:18.440
The director used to be a cinematographer.
so he's good at taking interesting shots.

00:14:19.024 --> 00:14:20.818
Do you know the name of every director?

00:14:20.901 --> 00:14:23.320
You would, too,
if you lived with Cheon Sang-hak.

00:14:26.198 --> 00:14:27.908
I think Cheon Sang-hak's crazy.

00:14:28.993 --> 00:14:31.120
He's in senior year,
yet he's seen every movie.

00:14:31.829 --> 00:14:33.747
But he gets way better grades than me.

00:14:34.582 --> 00:14:36.750
In one mock exam,
he placed 12th in the country.

00:14:37.626 --> 00:14:38.794
Twelfth in the country?

00:14:38.878 --> 00:14:39.712
Yeah.

00:14:43.591 --> 00:14:44.592
Ms. Yoon?

00:14:49.346 --> 00:14:51.849
Ms. Yoon! Hello.

00:14:52.349 --> 00:14:53.183
Oh my, Eun-jung!

00:14:54.101 --> 00:14:56.812
Eun-jung, you sure have grown!

00:14:56.896 --> 00:14:59.148
It's been so long. Give me a hug.

00:15:13.913 --> 00:15:15.623
How's your mom's diner?

00:15:15.706 --> 00:15:19.293
I'm not sure, but she says fewer people
come since the department store opened.

00:15:20.002 --> 00:15:20.836
I can imagine.

00:15:22.254 --> 00:15:25.841
Your mom's hand-torn noodles are great.
I should go have them sometime.

00:15:29.303 --> 00:15:30.137
I don't want this.

00:15:31.597 --> 00:15:32.431
Why not?

00:15:33.057 --> 00:15:34.558
Eun-jung, eat up.

00:15:34.642 --> 00:15:37.102
Sang-yeon, help yourself
when you're ready.

00:15:43.025 --> 00:15:44.777
-I'm home.
-Welcome.

00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:48.072
It's Sang-yeon's brother.
Wash your hands and come eat.

00:15:54.745 --> 00:15:56.664
-She's my friend.
-And my student.

00:15:59.667 --> 00:16:01.502
I know. Ryu Eun-jung.

00:16:03.671 --> 00:16:06.173
How do you know her?

00:16:07.925 --> 00:16:08.884
I saw her ages ago.

00:16:10.052 --> 00:16:12.137
-"Ages ago"?
-That's too much rice.

00:16:12.221 --> 00:16:13.180
Right, okay.

00:16:14.848 --> 00:16:15.933
When?

00:16:17.476 --> 00:16:19.144
Just a long time ago.

00:16:19.979 --> 00:16:21.188
I'll tell you later.

00:16:23.273 --> 00:16:25.818
I didn't think he'd remember.

00:16:26.318 --> 00:16:27.319
Who are you?

00:16:30.489 --> 00:16:32.449
Who… are you?

00:16:33.617 --> 00:16:37.037
I'm, well… I'm Ryu Eun-jung.

00:16:38.914 --> 00:16:40.124
-Eun-jung's leaving.
-Right.

00:16:40.207 --> 00:16:41.041
See ya.

00:16:41.125 --> 00:16:44.169
-Did you have fun?
-Yes, thank you. I'll be going.

00:16:44.253 --> 00:16:45.295
See you at school.

00:16:48.757 --> 00:16:50.092
Eun-jung, one second.

00:16:51.802 --> 00:16:52.803
Yes?

00:16:53.762 --> 00:16:56.640
Sang-hak, it's late.
Why don't you take Eun-jung home?

00:16:56.724 --> 00:16:59.643
That's all right.
There's no need. I can go alone.

00:16:59.727 --> 00:17:01.520
It's late. Go on.

00:17:15.784 --> 00:17:17.828
You should go now.

00:17:18.537 --> 00:17:19.663
I can go alone.

00:17:21.165 --> 00:17:22.249
Where do you live?

00:17:25.586 --> 00:17:27.379
Over that way, but…

00:17:31.133 --> 00:17:32.718
You really don't need to walk me.

00:17:33.218 --> 00:17:36.513
It's not even dark,
and I'm not at all scared.

00:17:37.431 --> 00:17:40.684
At the time,
the thing I hated most in the world

00:17:41.185 --> 00:17:42.186
was our side door.

00:17:43.228 --> 00:17:46.482
The side door next to our landlord
that led to our semi-basement.

00:17:47.024 --> 00:17:51.195
I didn't want to let anyone see me
walking in through that door.

00:17:51.945 --> 00:17:54.281
-How's Sang-yeon these days?
-Sorry?

00:17:54.990 --> 00:17:55.908
Sang-yeon?

00:17:56.992 --> 00:17:59.286
She's great.
She always gets perfect grades.

00:18:01.121 --> 00:18:04.083
But I think
there's much more to her than that.

00:18:05.709 --> 00:18:08.796
She's the brightest kid I've met,
and she knows all sorts of stuff.

00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:11.215
She does?

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:13.634
She dances.

00:18:14.343 --> 00:18:16.845
Did you know that she's a great dancer?

00:18:18.305 --> 00:18:19.848
Sang-yeon's good at dancing?

00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:22.893
Yes. She's great at it.

00:18:29.316 --> 00:18:31.777
What are you going to major in?

00:18:32.611 --> 00:18:33.821
Photography.

00:18:34.988 --> 00:18:36.949
-Photography?
-Yes.

00:18:37.658 --> 00:18:38.992
If I get in, that is.

00:18:39.701 --> 00:18:40.786
Right…

00:18:42.204 --> 00:18:43.038
What is it?

00:18:44.832 --> 00:18:48.919
You're so smart that I thought
you'd pursue a more traditional major.

00:18:50.129 --> 00:18:52.005
What's a "traditional major"?

00:18:54.383 --> 00:18:58.345
Like law or medicine…

00:19:04.935 --> 00:19:07.354
Oh, I forgot. I need to buy something.

00:19:08.021 --> 00:19:12.025
I'm going to stop by that supermarket,
so you can go on ahead.

00:19:13.443 --> 00:19:14.278
Okay.

00:19:16.572 --> 00:19:18.699
I meant that you should go now…

00:19:19.992 --> 00:19:24.121
I have a ton of stuff to buy.
It'll take me a while to buy everything.

00:19:24.746 --> 00:19:26.248
Take your time.

00:19:32.754 --> 00:19:39.428
DAJEONG SUPERMARKET

00:19:58.530 --> 00:19:59.573
What were you doing?

00:20:02.576 --> 00:20:03.493
Nothing.

00:20:05.412 --> 00:20:07.039
The alley's so beautiful.

00:20:10.709 --> 00:20:12.044
It's not in the slightest.

00:20:13.503 --> 00:20:14.421
It is.

00:20:17.174 --> 00:20:19.176
You wouldn't think that if you lived here.

00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:21.637
You don't know what it's like.

00:20:26.266 --> 00:20:27.601
Please go now.

00:20:28.518 --> 00:20:30.187
I told you I wanted to go alone.

00:20:36.193 --> 00:20:37.027
Right…

00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:39.154
Okay.

00:20:40.739 --> 00:20:42.908
Right. You did.

00:20:42.991 --> 00:20:43.867
Sure.

00:20:45.327 --> 00:20:47.079
Looks like you'll be fine on your own.

00:20:49.957 --> 00:20:51.041
Goodbye.

00:20:54.461 --> 00:20:55.545
Hey.

00:21:02.511 --> 00:21:03.637
I'm sorry.

00:21:06.473 --> 00:21:08.558
For taking a photo

00:21:09.101 --> 00:21:10.894
without knowing much about the area

00:21:12.062 --> 00:21:13.397
and calling it beautiful.

00:21:17.985 --> 00:21:19.069
It's not you.

00:21:23.031 --> 00:21:25.659
I'm just being sensitive…

00:21:27.661 --> 00:21:29.204
because I'm insecure.

00:21:32.708 --> 00:21:35.752
Everyone thinks I'm confident.

00:21:40.090 --> 00:21:41.133
I'm like that too.

00:21:44.761 --> 00:21:46.555
I have things I don't want to show

00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:51.643
or tell people about, you know?

00:21:52.602 --> 00:21:53.687
You do?

00:21:56.148 --> 00:21:58.483
You have things like that too?

00:21:58.567 --> 00:21:59.443
A lot.

00:22:00.652 --> 00:22:04.740
I have hella, many, lots.

00:22:06.241 --> 00:22:07.743
"Hella, many, lots"?

00:22:09.578 --> 00:22:10.579
Yep.

00:22:13.623 --> 00:22:15.042
Do you want to take a look?

00:22:32.351 --> 00:22:34.061
It was all quite strange.

00:22:35.604 --> 00:22:37.397
The alley I saw through the camera…

00:22:39.733 --> 00:22:40.942
was beautiful,

00:22:42.569 --> 00:22:43.820
as if by magic.

00:22:45.947 --> 00:22:46.865
It's pretty.

00:22:52.412 --> 00:22:55.749
I'm glad I'm not the only one
who thinks so.

00:23:43.547 --> 00:23:45.590
Mrs. Yoon is so lucky.

00:23:47.384 --> 00:23:48.969
If I hire you a tutor,

00:23:49.052 --> 00:23:51.805
will you get into Seoul University
and make me a proud mama?

00:23:52.681 --> 00:23:54.474
A tutor? What tutor?

00:23:56.268 --> 00:23:57.727
A Seoul University student.

00:23:57.811 --> 00:23:59.104
CONGRATULATIONS CHEON SANG-HAK

00:23:59.187 --> 00:24:01.440
Sang-hak didn't end up
majoring in photography.

00:24:01.523 --> 00:24:03.859
ACCEPTED INTO SEOUL UNIVERSITY
TO STUDY BUSINESS MANAGEMENT

00:24:05.485 --> 00:24:06.528
Sang-yeon's brother?

00:24:12.951 --> 00:24:14.661
My brother is being odd. Don't be shocked.

00:24:16.538 --> 00:24:18.999
Why? Is he odd?

00:24:19.499 --> 00:24:21.126
He doesn't really talk.

00:24:21.793 --> 00:24:23.295
He never really did.

00:24:23.378 --> 00:24:25.630
But he suddenly
wanted to study photography,

00:24:25.714 --> 00:24:27.257
which caused tension with Dad.

00:24:27.340 --> 00:24:29.551
Maybe why he only responds
"yes" or "no" lately.

00:24:31.052 --> 00:24:33.221
Then how will he tutor us?

00:24:33.305 --> 00:24:34.598
He'll manage just fine.

00:24:34.681 --> 00:24:37.559
He's being paid to tutor us. He'll talk.

00:24:37.642 --> 00:24:40.520
-He just won't say anything else.
-Right.

00:24:42.439 --> 00:24:43.356
Is that a new top?

00:24:47.527 --> 00:24:48.862
I thought it was pretty.

00:24:54.826 --> 00:24:56.661
Hello…

00:25:03.793 --> 00:25:05.378
Right. Chapter one.

00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:08.381
Polynomials and factorization.

00:25:11.259 --> 00:25:13.678
Let's start with factorization.

00:25:17.474 --> 00:25:18.308
9 MONTHS LATER

00:25:18.391 --> 00:25:20.018
It's so unfair.

00:25:20.101 --> 00:25:22.103
What kind of test question was that?

00:25:22.187 --> 00:25:23.188
Tell me about it.

00:25:23.813 --> 00:25:25.649
-Want some toast?
-Yeah.

00:25:30.904 --> 00:25:35.033
I got everything right on the math test
and only one wrong in English.

00:25:35.659 --> 00:25:39.829
But the Korean test was a total mess.
Still, Sang-yeon only got one wrong.

00:25:56.555 --> 00:25:58.431
The question is a little vague.

00:25:59.224 --> 00:26:02.894
Clearly, number two is the answer,
but it could also be number five.

00:26:04.145 --> 00:26:07.440
It's not unreasonable
to define the character as pessimistic.

00:26:11.528 --> 00:26:13.947
Do you know what this word means?

00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:16.992
"Pessimistic."

00:26:18.493 --> 00:26:20.704
No. I've never heard of it before.

00:26:22.414 --> 00:26:24.541
The characters mean "to loathe"
and "the world."

00:26:25.041 --> 00:26:27.043
It means an attitude
of loathing the world.

00:26:27.752 --> 00:26:30.213
It's the same character
you use to mean inflammation.

00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:32.424
Right.

00:26:33.383 --> 00:26:34.634
Pessimistic.

00:26:50.650 --> 00:26:53.486
To loathe the world…

00:27:00.243 --> 00:27:01.161
Whatcha doing?

00:27:02.912 --> 00:27:04.497
I think I'm too pessimistic.

00:27:06.082 --> 00:27:07.250
A pesty… what?

00:27:09.878 --> 00:27:13.173
Not pesty, pessimistic.
I'm such a pessimist.

00:27:14.507 --> 00:27:15.383
What's that?

00:27:15.884 --> 00:27:17.427
To loathe the world.

00:27:17.927 --> 00:27:19.638
It means an attitude
of loathing the world.

00:27:21.181 --> 00:27:23.475
Right. Is that so?

00:27:24.225 --> 00:27:27.228
Ju-eun asked if we're gonna watch
Men In Black at her house later.

00:27:30.607 --> 00:27:31.441
Sure.

00:27:34.486 --> 00:27:35.862
She didn't understand.

00:27:37.405 --> 00:27:39.699
But whether anyone understood,

00:27:41.117 --> 00:27:42.661
every time I was given the chance,

00:27:43.745 --> 00:27:44.954
I used that word.

00:27:45.038 --> 00:27:47.540
-Try this one.
-That ballpoint pops out easily on those.

00:27:48.291 --> 00:27:49.751
Yeah, mine did that too.

00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:52.879
Monami pens are good.

00:27:54.464 --> 00:27:55.632
You're buying a blue one?

00:27:55.715 --> 00:27:59.219
-"Blue" means depressed, you know.
-Why? Are you depressed?

00:27:59.719 --> 00:28:02.514
-Yeah, I'm just such a pessimist.
-A pessimist?

00:28:03.223 --> 00:28:05.725
I don't know.
She keeps insisting she's a pestymist.

00:28:06.226 --> 00:28:08.019
Not a pestymist, a pessimist.

00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:10.146
It means "to loathe the world."

00:28:11.398 --> 00:28:13.692
-I'm a total pessimist.
-No, you're not.

00:28:23.493 --> 00:28:25.245
Sang-yeon went to the bathroom.

00:28:51.271 --> 00:28:53.356
"Blue" means depressed, you know.

00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:55.734
Yeah, I'm just such a pessimist.

00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:00.238
Eun-jung.

00:29:02.031 --> 00:29:03.950
What's your favorite thing in the world?

00:29:06.202 --> 00:29:08.788
-Sang-hak starting a conversation…
-Me?

00:29:10.206 --> 00:29:13.710
It was the first time he'd done so
since he'd started tutoring me.

00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:17.839
My favorite thing in the world…

00:29:18.923 --> 00:29:20.633
Well,

00:29:21.134 --> 00:29:23.011
I like Wink.

00:29:23.887 --> 00:29:24.888
"Wink"?

00:29:25.388 --> 00:29:27.515
It's a biweekly comic magazine.

00:29:29.517 --> 00:29:34.063
I like Wink, H.O.T, and puppies,
but my mom won't let me have one.

00:29:35.231 --> 00:29:36.566
I like sweetcorn. It's tasty.

00:29:37.692 --> 00:29:40.570
Oh, I forgot about my mom.
I really like my mom.

00:29:41.321 --> 00:29:44.491
I like Sang-yeon, Na-mi,
and Ju-eun, my friends.

00:29:44.991 --> 00:29:46.201
And Ms. Yoon.

00:29:46.826 --> 00:29:49.078
I really like Ms. Yoon.

00:29:51.039 --> 00:29:52.165
And…

00:29:58.713 --> 00:30:00.256
I like our tutoring sessions.

00:30:17.148 --> 00:30:18.274
What is it?

00:30:18.983 --> 00:30:20.318
It's just Eun-jung.

00:30:21.236 --> 00:30:24.948
She thinks she's such a pessimist.

00:30:25.532 --> 00:30:26.866
-Eun-jung, a pessimist?
-Yes.

00:30:26.950 --> 00:30:29.744
So I asked her what her favorite thing is,

00:30:30.537 --> 00:30:32.539
and she had this endless list.

00:30:33.623 --> 00:30:36.334
She has an exhaustive list of things
she likes in the world

00:30:36.417 --> 00:30:37.752
yet claims she's a pessimist.

00:30:39.796 --> 00:30:42.924
I keep thinking about that
and find myself laughing.

00:30:46.052 --> 00:30:48.263
That's… funny?

00:30:58.106 --> 00:30:59.107
Eun-jung.

00:31:01.442 --> 00:31:02.694
Hello.

00:31:09.868 --> 00:31:12.328
I'm going to eat tteokbokki
with Sang-yeon.

00:31:13.496 --> 00:31:14.914
Where were you coming from?

00:31:21.629 --> 00:31:23.923
I bought a new camera.
Do you want to see it?

00:31:26.926 --> 00:31:27.760
Yes.

00:31:28.386 --> 00:31:29.637
It's a Leica.

00:31:32.056 --> 00:31:33.141
A "Leica"?

00:31:33.683 --> 00:31:37.061
That's right.
That's the name of the manufacturer.

00:31:38.938 --> 00:31:41.566
It's pretty. It sounds like a girl's name.

00:31:44.777 --> 00:31:45.612
Eun-jung.

00:31:46.905 --> 00:31:50.533
Do you know
there was once a puppy named Laika?

00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:53.494
No.

00:31:55.038 --> 00:31:58.958
The Russian people, back in the early days
of space exploration,

00:31:59.584 --> 00:32:03.546
sent a dog into space on a spacecraft
instead of a human.

00:32:04.047 --> 00:32:05.715
That dog's name was Laika.

00:32:06.799 --> 00:32:08.551
-On a spacecraft?
-Yes.

00:32:09.510 --> 00:32:10.720
What happened to it?

00:32:13.306 --> 00:32:15.600
It never actually returned.

00:32:18.186 --> 00:32:19.228
It didn't?

00:32:21.022 --> 00:32:22.857
That must have been scary.

00:32:26.778 --> 00:32:27.820
You're right.

00:32:34.911 --> 00:32:37.914
Why did you buy a new camera
when you already have so many?

00:32:40.667 --> 00:32:42.669
I've always wanted this one.

00:32:45.338 --> 00:32:47.298
Do you like photography that much?

00:32:50.134 --> 00:32:50.969
Yes.

00:32:54.055 --> 00:32:55.765
When I'm taking a photograph…

00:32:58.017 --> 00:32:59.519
I feel at ease.

00:33:01.396 --> 00:33:03.231
How does it make you feel at ease?

00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:05.316
How?

00:33:12.949 --> 00:33:13.783
Here.

00:33:15.535 --> 00:33:17.787
This was shot with a shutter speed of 60,

00:33:17.870 --> 00:33:21.416
which means this photo captured
1/60th of a second.

00:33:22.792 --> 00:33:24.585
It looks like everything's frozen,

00:33:24.669 --> 00:33:27.755
but in reality, the photo's moving
for 1/60th of a second.

00:33:30.049 --> 00:33:33.219
To take a photograph is to collect time.

00:33:34.053 --> 00:33:38.099
Even if it's a fleeting instant,
photos can capture the truth as it is.

00:33:39.767 --> 00:33:43.312
But photographs can be misleading.

00:33:44.355 --> 00:33:49.068
Since it's a fleeting moment, what may not
be true can be made to appear truthful.

00:33:52.572 --> 00:33:54.907
What do you think? Isn't it fun?

00:33:55.575 --> 00:33:56.659
It is.

00:33:57.577 --> 00:33:59.704
Please teach me photography sometime.

00:34:03.332 --> 00:34:04.417
Sure.

00:34:11.799 --> 00:34:13.176
Isn't it pretty?

00:34:13.259 --> 00:34:14.802
Yeah, it's pretty.

00:34:26.064 --> 00:34:28.024
-What are you two doing?
-There you are.

00:34:29.067 --> 00:34:30.401
He bought a new camera.

00:34:31.277 --> 00:34:33.613
-You bought another one?
-Have fun.

00:34:33.696 --> 00:34:35.114
Goodbye.

00:34:39.911 --> 00:34:42.080
We should have asked him to eat with us.

00:34:42.705 --> 00:34:44.582
Or doesn't he like tteokbokki?

00:34:45.875 --> 00:34:47.335
Did you ask him to see it?

00:34:48.544 --> 00:34:49.420
What?

00:34:49.504 --> 00:34:50.671
His camera.

00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:55.760
He offered to show it to me first,
saying he bought a new one.

00:34:56.594 --> 00:34:58.721
He says he'll teach me how to take photos.

00:34:59.597 --> 00:35:03.267
He's so interesting.
I've never met someone who talks like him.

00:35:03.768 --> 00:35:06.479
Why did you say he doesn't talk?
He talks just fine to me.

00:35:06.562 --> 00:35:07.897
So what?

00:35:09.107 --> 00:35:11.734
Do you think he talks to you
because you're special?

00:35:14.737 --> 00:35:16.531
Hey, what's wrong?

00:35:17.156 --> 00:35:18.282
You're ridiculous.

00:35:19.659 --> 00:35:20.868
How am I ridiculous?

00:35:21.369 --> 00:35:24.580
Do you really think you're a pessimist?

00:35:26.541 --> 00:35:28.709
What's that got to do with anything?

00:35:28.793 --> 00:35:31.546
Do you even know what it means
to go around saying that?

00:35:31.629 --> 00:35:33.965
How could someone
as simple as you be a pessimist?

00:35:36.217 --> 00:35:37.218
Hey!

00:35:38.678 --> 00:35:40.638
You think you know people so well?

00:35:41.139 --> 00:35:43.766
How would you know
if I'm simple, complicated, or--

00:35:43.850 --> 00:35:45.268
You like my brother, don't you?

00:35:49.397 --> 00:35:51.440
-I do not.
-Of course you do.

00:35:51.524 --> 00:35:54.485
I told you I don't because I don't.
Why are you questioning me?

00:35:54.569 --> 00:35:55.611
Great, then.

00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:57.989
Because he has a girlfriend.

00:35:59.866 --> 00:36:03.995
Liking him would be pointless,
so keep telling yourself you don't.

00:36:08.166 --> 00:36:09.208
Hey!

00:36:24.849 --> 00:36:26.809
Sang-hak, do you have pencil refills?

00:36:52.919 --> 00:36:55.171
-Did you have a good session?
-Yes. I'll be going.

00:36:55.254 --> 00:36:58.841
No, wait, Eun-jung.
We've ordered pizza, so eat with us.

00:36:58.925 --> 00:37:00.676
That's all right. I'm not hungry.

00:37:05.014 --> 00:37:07.266
All right, then. Get home safe, okay?

00:37:09.268 --> 00:37:11.020
-Take care.
-Goodbye.

00:37:17.276 --> 00:37:18.819
She can be so mean.

00:37:25.284 --> 00:37:27.495
Why didn't you say goodbye to your friend?

00:37:29.288 --> 00:37:33.000
It's not like she said goodbye to me.
Why are you having a go at me?

00:37:33.084 --> 00:37:35.795
Because you live here,
and Eun-jung's a guest.

00:37:38.381 --> 00:37:40.216
Forget about it. I have a test tomorrow.

00:37:40.758 --> 00:37:42.134
Cheon Sang-yeon!

00:37:43.511 --> 00:37:46.097
You're always sulking on the sofa
and barely say goodbye.

00:37:46.597 --> 00:37:50.017
When your friend leaves, the least
you can do is open the door for her.

00:37:50.101 --> 00:37:51.394
I'd rather you be kind than--

00:37:51.477 --> 00:37:52.478
If she's so great…

00:37:55.481 --> 00:37:59.485
have her be your daughter.
Seems like that would be for the best.

00:38:00.111 --> 00:38:00.987
What?

00:38:04.282 --> 00:38:05.449
You're so annoying.

00:38:08.119 --> 00:38:09.370
Cheon Sang-yeon!

00:38:42.570 --> 00:38:43.738
Hey, kids!

00:38:43.821 --> 00:38:45.489
Hello!

00:38:45.573 --> 00:38:46.615
The line is so long.

00:38:47.158 --> 00:38:48.743
Ms. Yoon paged me.

00:38:48.826 --> 00:38:51.162
That teacher
is Cheon Sang-yeon's mom, right?

00:38:51.662 --> 00:38:53.331
Must be about her missing school.

00:38:54.206 --> 00:38:55.124
She missed school?

00:38:55.875 --> 00:38:57.376
-But we have a test today.
-Yeah.

00:38:57.460 --> 00:39:00.463
The teacher called her family,
and they said she'd left for school.

00:39:02.048 --> 00:39:03.341
Maybe she ran away.

00:39:03.966 --> 00:39:04.842
Ran away?

00:39:59.939 --> 00:40:01.482
Where the heck are you?

00:40:01.982 --> 00:40:05.486
Did you really run away from home?
Why aren't you checking your pager?

00:40:11.075 --> 00:40:12.493
You're really cute.

00:40:13.035 --> 00:40:14.036
Got any cash?

00:40:23.170 --> 00:40:25.923
Come on, I must have paged you
over a hundred times!

00:40:28.342 --> 00:40:29.927
Seriously, where are you?

00:40:58.831 --> 00:40:59.665
Sang-yeon.

00:41:04.336 --> 00:41:05.546
You're unbelievable.

00:41:08.132 --> 00:41:08.966
I…

00:41:10.134 --> 00:41:11.760
got my money stolen.

00:41:22.021 --> 00:41:24.356
Hurry and eat up before you catch a cold.

00:41:28.402 --> 00:41:30.821
Try it. My mom's
hand-torn noodle soup is good.

00:41:35.409 --> 00:41:36.410
Here.

00:41:37.286 --> 00:41:39.872
Why aren't you eating?
You said you were hungry.

00:41:40.998 --> 00:41:44.793
Mrs. Jang, the thing is,
I don't have any money right now.

00:41:45.294 --> 00:41:47.004
Could I pay you tomorrow?

00:41:51.342 --> 00:41:54.094
Don't worry about paying, silly.

00:41:54.845 --> 00:41:55.679
Why not?

00:41:56.555 --> 00:41:58.724
Do I ever pay when I eat at your house?

00:42:00.518 --> 00:42:02.728
But this is a diner.

00:42:03.854 --> 00:42:06.482
Yeah, but you're my friend.

00:42:07.066 --> 00:42:07.900
Right, Mom?

00:42:07.983 --> 00:42:10.736
Of course. Eat up. You must be hungry.

00:42:13.572 --> 00:42:15.115
Thank you for the food.

00:42:18.619 --> 00:42:22.665
Sang-yeon, I knew you were bright,
but I never knew you were so adorable.

00:42:23.332 --> 00:42:27.878
Sang-yeon, if you ever want
to eat something, you're welcome here.

00:42:27.962 --> 00:42:30.172
Even more so if you don't have any money.

00:42:30.673 --> 00:42:31.674
Okay?

00:42:38.222 --> 00:42:39.223
Hey…

00:42:45.646 --> 00:42:46.814
Thank you.

00:42:58.409 --> 00:43:00.202
This is it. My home.

00:43:18.053 --> 00:43:20.806
Is it okay for you to break this open?

00:43:21.432 --> 00:43:25.227
What choice do we have?
You're penniless, and you won't go home.

00:43:26.395 --> 00:43:29.857
I need to break this open
so you can spend the night at a bathhouse.

00:43:31.859 --> 00:43:34.236
-I promise to pay you back.
-You better.

00:43:34.737 --> 00:43:37.072
And you better buy me a new piggy bank.

00:43:43.871 --> 00:43:46.665
You're the first person I've invited over.

00:43:47.249 --> 00:43:48.125
You're lying.

00:43:48.208 --> 00:43:49.793
Why would I lie about that?

00:43:51.253 --> 00:43:54.298
You have countless friends
that you always hang out with.

00:43:54.381 --> 00:43:57.343
But I've never invited them over.

00:43:58.218 --> 00:43:59.053
Why not?

00:44:01.513 --> 00:44:02.598
It's embarrassing.

00:44:03.766 --> 00:44:04.600
What is?

00:44:07.561 --> 00:44:09.438
You're really slow at times.

00:44:10.481 --> 00:44:12.191
I live in a semi-basement.

00:44:15.027 --> 00:44:16.070
A semi-basement…

00:44:17.237 --> 00:44:20.115
I know it's not something
to be embarrassed about,

00:44:21.075 --> 00:44:22.701
but it's still embarrassing.

00:44:23.786 --> 00:44:24.953
It's stupid, isn't it?

00:44:33.420 --> 00:44:34.588
My mom…

00:44:37.675 --> 00:44:38.967
doesn't like me.

00:44:39.468 --> 00:44:40.302
What?

00:44:41.303 --> 00:44:43.972
My mom doesn't like me.

00:44:44.056 --> 00:44:45.474
Stop talking nonsense.

00:44:46.517 --> 00:44:49.645
You don't have to believe me.
Doesn't change the fact that it's true.

00:44:54.483 --> 00:44:55.442
Who could it be?

00:44:57.194 --> 00:44:58.362
Who is it?

00:45:01.990 --> 00:45:03.075
Ms. Yoon…

00:45:11.291 --> 00:45:12.292
To the military?

00:45:13.043 --> 00:45:16.338
Yeah. He had a huge argument
with Dad yesterday.

00:45:19.049 --> 00:45:21.427
My dad beat Sang-hak.

00:45:22.469 --> 00:45:24.138
-He beat him?
-Yeah.

00:45:25.097 --> 00:45:27.224
He said he should have
enlisted him sooner.

00:45:27.307 --> 00:45:28.308
When is he leaving?

00:45:41.029 --> 00:45:42.281
Next month, on the 7th.

00:45:43.031 --> 00:45:45.993
Wait. That's in less than two weeks.

00:45:46.577 --> 00:45:47.745
Yeah.

00:45:49.621 --> 00:45:52.166
Do you want to hear some good news?

00:45:52.791 --> 00:45:53.625
Yeah.

00:45:53.709 --> 00:45:56.670
Cheon Sang-hak broke up with that girl.

00:45:57.254 --> 00:45:59.006
-They broke up?
-Yes.

00:45:59.757 --> 00:46:01.049
Because Mom disapproved.

00:46:02.551 --> 00:46:03.594
Do you want to see?

00:46:04.344 --> 00:46:05.179
See what?

00:46:12.770 --> 00:46:14.897
-Here it is.
-What are you doing?

00:46:16.565 --> 00:46:17.983
It's Cheon Sang-hak's diary.

00:46:25.908 --> 00:46:27.493
I've decided to go to the military.

00:46:29.369 --> 00:46:32.206
I know you'll say I'm being stupid,

00:46:32.956 --> 00:46:37.169
but let's think of it
as me putting my foot down.

00:46:39.505 --> 00:46:42.132
I'm going to run away,

00:46:43.759 --> 00:46:45.052
far away from you.

00:46:46.220 --> 00:46:48.472
I want to run as far away as I can.

00:46:49.848 --> 00:46:50.766
But, M,

00:46:51.934 --> 00:46:53.435
if I really can't stay away,

00:46:54.770 --> 00:46:56.855
if I just can't bear to forget you,

00:46:57.731 --> 00:46:58.774
then…

00:47:00.776 --> 00:47:02.945
I'll find my way to you.

00:47:03.612 --> 00:47:04.947
What do you make of it?

00:47:09.618 --> 00:47:13.497
"M."

00:47:14.081 --> 00:47:16.124
Every entry is written to her.

00:47:16.875 --> 00:47:18.585
I don't think they've broken up.

00:47:21.630 --> 00:47:24.049
I wonder what he means by,
"I'll find my way to you."

00:47:27.052 --> 00:47:29.263
Maybe it means
he's going to run away with her.

00:47:33.141 --> 00:47:34.768
Dear Sang-hak.

00:47:35.686 --> 00:47:38.564
Hello. This is Eun-jung.

00:47:39.898 --> 00:47:44.444
Sang-yeon told me
that you're leaving for the military.

00:47:45.779 --> 00:47:49.116
I didn't end up writing that I liked him.

00:47:49.950 --> 00:47:53.203
Instead, I told him
that I wanted to quickly turn 20.

00:47:56.957 --> 00:47:59.960
When you're on leave,
please treat me to some good food.

00:48:00.961 --> 00:48:03.672
I only managed to write down
the useless stuff.

00:48:10.012 --> 00:48:14.516
P.S. This is the clover my dad gave me
when I was seven.

00:48:15.017 --> 00:48:16.894
I wanted to give it to you.

00:48:41.627 --> 00:48:46.506
TO SANG-HAK OPPA

00:48:46.590 --> 00:48:49.384
Hello? I asked if you want me
to add an egg.

00:48:49.468 --> 00:48:50.636
Sure.

00:49:05.943 --> 00:49:07.694
Hello, Sang-hak.

00:49:07.778 --> 00:49:09.821
Mom says to drink the herbal medicine
before bed.

00:49:09.905 --> 00:49:10.864
Okay.

00:49:11.490 --> 00:49:12.991
Eun-jung is sleeping over.

00:49:14.868 --> 00:49:18.789
Sang-yeon's parents
weren't home that night.

00:49:49.861 --> 00:49:50.946
Where did you go?

00:49:52.948 --> 00:49:54.533
I was taking out the trash.

00:49:55.242 --> 00:49:57.494
Right… Well, good night.

00:50:01.039 --> 00:50:02.165
Eun-jung.

00:50:03.417 --> 00:50:04.459
Yes?

00:50:06.169 --> 00:50:07.004
One second.

00:50:14.386 --> 00:50:16.138
I'll teach you how to take photos.

00:50:16.638 --> 00:50:17.514
Right now?

00:50:20.892 --> 00:50:24.062
-Is it too late?
-No. Please teach me.

00:50:27.858 --> 00:50:30.652
The film is loaded. You can learn
how to change it another time.

00:50:31.737 --> 00:50:34.072
Let's first look at the lens and body.

00:50:40.162 --> 00:50:43.790
He didn't seem to have read
the letter yet.

00:50:54.134 --> 00:50:55.594
The dog is cute.

00:50:58.722 --> 00:51:01.767
It's Laika, the dog I mentioned before.

00:51:02.267 --> 00:51:05.312
Right. The spacecraft dog.

00:51:05.395 --> 00:51:06.229
That's the one.

00:51:06.813 --> 00:51:10.984
Now, can you see this number
next to the camera lens?

00:51:12.110 --> 00:51:13.028
This number…

00:52:00.826 --> 00:52:01.952
Good job.

00:52:03.453 --> 00:52:06.248
Lastly, this is the timer.

00:52:06.748 --> 00:52:10.544
If you turn this and press the button,
it takes a photo ten seconds later.

00:52:13.672 --> 00:52:15.715
-Can I try?
-Sure.

00:52:18.218 --> 00:52:19.928
Let's take a photo together.

00:52:34.818 --> 00:52:38.655
I can never forget those ten seconds
I shared with Cheon Sang-hak.

00:52:40.866 --> 00:52:44.411
Sang-hak told me
to set the shutter speed to 125,

00:52:44.911 --> 00:52:46.413
but I set it to 60.

00:52:49.457 --> 00:52:51.459
Because 1/60th of a second

00:52:52.210 --> 00:52:54.546
is longer than 1/125th of a second.

00:52:55.547 --> 00:52:59.759
I wanted to stay in that photo with him
for just a while longer.

00:53:04.097 --> 00:53:04.931
You can have it.

00:53:07.517 --> 00:53:08.685
You're giving this to me?

00:53:09.853 --> 00:53:10.687
Yes.

00:53:11.980 --> 00:53:14.399
Why would you give me this?
It's so expensive.

00:53:14.482 --> 00:53:16.234
I won't be taking photos anymore.

00:53:18.945 --> 00:53:20.447
Because you'll be in the army?

00:53:25.410 --> 00:53:26.244
Yes.

00:53:26.328 --> 00:53:30.373
Why not take photos after you get back?
You love it so much.

00:53:38.048 --> 00:53:42.302
On second thought,
could you lend this to me for one week?

00:53:42.385 --> 00:53:44.387
I promise to return it after that.

00:53:47.807 --> 00:53:48.683
Sang-hak

00:53:49.935 --> 00:53:50.894
smiled.

00:53:52.938 --> 00:53:53.939
Thank you.

00:54:04.532 --> 00:54:06.159
That was the very last

00:54:07.744 --> 00:54:10.497
I ever saw of Cheon Sang-hak.

00:54:23.677 --> 00:54:25.845
Oh, this is a black-and-white roll.

00:54:26.763 --> 00:54:28.974
I can't develop this film here for you.

00:54:29.724 --> 00:54:32.102
Why not? Because it's black-and-white?

00:54:32.602 --> 00:54:34.229
Not necessarily.

00:54:35.063 --> 00:54:39.776
This isn't your average film,
so it's developed with specific chemicals.

00:54:39.859 --> 00:54:43.196
You need to go to a specialized lab.
Maybe somewhere in Chungmuro.

00:54:43.738 --> 00:54:45.573
Or you could do it yourself at home.

00:55:09.431 --> 00:55:10.307
Chungmuro…

00:55:34.622 --> 00:55:39.544
SPRING OF 2001

00:55:46.301 --> 00:55:47.427
I'll see you later!

00:55:55.602 --> 00:55:57.771
Guys! We're Cheerleading Club!

00:55:58.521 --> 00:56:00.940
You're so beautiful.
Won't you join Acting Club?

00:56:01.024 --> 00:56:01.858
I'm all right.

00:56:11.284 --> 00:56:14.329
We are Photography Club!
It's Photography Club!

00:56:14.412 --> 00:56:15.955
MAGIC HOUR PHOTOGRAPHY CLUB

00:56:16.831 --> 00:56:20.168
First, you can sign up for our registry…

00:56:21.669 --> 00:56:25.965
If I learn photography here,
would I be able to develop this roll?

00:56:26.049 --> 00:56:27.967
Absolutely!

00:56:28.468 --> 00:56:30.804
You're a freshman. Class of 2001, right?

00:56:31.346 --> 00:56:32.180
Yes.

00:56:40.230 --> 00:56:41.606
Isn't that Sang-hak?

00:56:41.689 --> 00:56:43.608
You're right, it is.

00:56:43.691 --> 00:56:44.984
Hey, Sang-hak!

01:00:35.923 --> 01:00:40.928
