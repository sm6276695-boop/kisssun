[Episode 22]

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:46.530
Slow down.

[Junlong Company]

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.009
You said I'm treating, right?

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.590
I'd like scrambled eggs with tomato

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.470
and some twice-cooked pork.

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:09.070
Okay.

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:10.050
Okay, thanks.

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.710
So this thing's called a computer, huh?

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:18.760
I bought it 6 months ago.

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:19.960
No one's ever used it.

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.050
Alright, Professor Xiang.

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:26.990
What brings you here today?

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.710
Let's talk.

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.470
You set your office here.

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.940
Aren't you afraid of bad luck?

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.150
Business depends on brains,

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.310
nothing else.

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:42.120
Besides,

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:43.829
when I rented this place,

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:45.829
that incident hadn't happened yet.

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:47.940
No, seriously—tell me the truth.

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.600
With so many fancy
office buildings around,

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:51.930
why'd you pick this one?

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:53.980
Fei had his accident here.

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.520
Doesn't that bother you?

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.040
I used to be a scholar too.

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:59.710
I need a cultural atmosphere.

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:00.710
When you entered this room,

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:02.640
didn't you feel the cultural vibe?

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:05.800
I didn't smell any culture.

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:08.140
But I did smell dog.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.030
Your nose is sharper than a dog's.

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.290
There actually is one, believe it or not.

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:14.550
Alright, enough joking around.

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:15.370
Let's talk business.

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.970
So,

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.840
how are things?

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.170
What are your plans now?

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.520
I don't know what to do.

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:23.200
Normally,

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:24.700
I could go to

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:25.680
a newspaper,

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:26.690
a magazine,

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:28.110
or a research institute.

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:32.870
You were a prominent reporter.

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:34.570
You know a lot of people.

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:36.690
Give me some advice, will you?

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:40.800
The idea that mindset determines destiny

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.360
is absolutely true.

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:43.240
Do you realize

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:45.190
everywhere's downsizing these days?

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:46.680
So, Professor Xiang,

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:48.470
have you won a Nobel Prize?

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.750
Or do you have some patented invention?

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:52.000
You have neither.

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.030
All you can do is writing.

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:55.710
Is that worth anything nowadays?

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:56.560
Not at all.

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:58.890
And you know what,

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:00.120
recently,

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.910
a friend of mine who works

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:02.430
at the Ministry of Education told me,

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.630
a new policy is about to be implemented.

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:05.840
After it takes effect,

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.800
college graduates
won't be assigned jobs anymore.

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.730
Do you understand what that means?

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:12.270
To enter any government
agency or institution,

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:14.270
you'll have to
take exams yourself.

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:15.370
Someone like me, Yan Jun,

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:16.670
who's got some influence, right?

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:17.579
It's useless.

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.750
So you're telling me
a university lecturer like me...

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:24.940
really has no way out?

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:26.860
That's the reality for you right now.

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:27.990
What did you expect?

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:35.310
Chuan,

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:36.980
I've told you before,

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:39.920
you need to adapt to
the trends of this era.

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:41.630
You need to keep up with the times.

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:42.600
Shift your mindset.

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:43.460
Think about it.

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:44.880
What do you mean?

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:49.080
To go into business like you?

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:50.950
Why not?

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:52.190
But I don't know how.

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:53.870
I'll teach you.

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:57.330
Our company is hiring right now.

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.070
But Chuan, if you join,

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:01.240
I'm not making you my employee.

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:03.240
The two of us would be partners.

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.730
I'm offering you
the position of Creative Director.

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:08.170
And the salary will be...

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:12.110
2,000 yuan.

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:14.380
After all these years as friends

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:15.150
and classmates,

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:16.680
I'm being generous, right?

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:17.870
Now it's up to you.

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.220
What do you say?

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:26.820
Doesn't your company sell dogs?

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:29.790
Why do you need a Creative Director?

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:32.190
We can be creative with dogs too.

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:33.770
Where do these dogs

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:36.159
come from?

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:37.760
What's their pedigree?

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:40.190
Why are they worth that much money?

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:41.830
Someone's got to tell that story.

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:43.480
That's where you come in.

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:46.560
I see.

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:48.870
So at future class reunions,

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:50.950
those of us who stayed at the university

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:53.010
can say we're supported by the state,

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:54.680
while you can only say

00:05:54.909 --> 00:05:56.370
you're supported by dogs.

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:57.510
You know what,

00:05:58.409 --> 00:06:00.830
my neighbor used to have
this exact same dog.

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:02.690
It actually looked a bit like you.

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:03.990
Mainly because you both bark a lot,

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:06.190
and honestly, you two even sound alike.

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:09.760
Xiang Beichuan,

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:13.090
what you're saying right now

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:16.480
only proves—
you can't have it, so you mock it.

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:19.200
It just shows you're jealous of my money.

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:21.500
Do you think your words
can hurt me at all?

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:24.330
Can you stop me from making money?

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:25.120
Can you?

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:26.160
Since you can't,

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:27.800
why keep saying these things?

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:28.560
It never ends.

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:30.000
Always poking where it hurts.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:30.420
Just...

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:31.480
speaking without any boundaries.

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:32.470
Is this how you treat people?

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:33.270
Is this what being educated means to you?

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:34.700
Is this how you handle things?

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:35.380
What...

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:37.200
What's wrong with you?

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.040
Why are you actually getting mad?

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:39.680
I...

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:41.120
Shouldn't I be mad?

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:42.240
Shouldn't I be?

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:43.600
If you were a dog, wouldn't you be mad?

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:44.390
Well, I...

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:45.790
I was just stating facts.

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:49.420
Mr. Yan, here's your food.

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:51.930
Put it on the table.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.240
Let's not waste time on useless talk.

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:03.240
Your current problem

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:05.040
is because of what happened with Fei,

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:06.450
you owe the university a lot of money,

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:06.970
right?

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:09.390
From your 2,000 yuan salary each month,

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:11.040
I'll deduct part to repay the university.

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:12.120
You can keep the rest.

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:13.320
What will your job be?

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:15.470
Besides

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:17.420
handling the promotion

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:19.100
of my dogs and such,

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:21.680
you'll also need to take their photos.

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:22.950
Before taking photos

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:24.870
you need to wash it thoroughly.

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:26.980
The fur must be shiny

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.120
and have texture.

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:31.950
Just like your hair—

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:34.159
not a single stray hair out of place.

00:07:34.159 --> 00:07:35.870
That's the standard. Got it?

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:37.430
If that's clear to you,

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:38.830
start work tomorrow.

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:44.090
Mr. Yan.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.159
I can't do this job.

00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:48.630
You'd better find someone else.

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:51.280
I'm going to the job market right now.

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:52.270
I refuse to believe

00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:54.000
that I can't find a writing job.

00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:55.830
If you can find a job

00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:57.510
that pays 2,000 yuan a month
at the job market,

00:07:57.510 --> 00:07:59.040
then I, Yan Jun, am that dog!

00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:00.460
Fine.

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:20.720
I'm leaving.

00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:26.990
[Shanghai Textile Industry Bureau]

00:08:35.669 --> 00:08:36.360
Ye.

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:37.630
Come here.

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:39.440
I have something to tell you.

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:42.400
Director Jin,

00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:45.160
why don't I see Director Yu?

00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:46.240
Director Yu?

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:48.360
You know your case

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:49.440
is extremely serious

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:50.870
and involves many people.

00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:53.080
Director Yu has been transferred
because of this.

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:53.890
What about me?

00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:55.790
The bureau has decided

00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:57.790
to give you a verbal warning

00:08:58.750 --> 00:09:00.680
without putting it in your record.

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:03.020
Your file will be transferred
to the talent exchange center.

00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:03.820
Director Jin,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.790
I didn't do anything wrong.

Could you please
speak to the leadership for me?

Does it mean

I have to find a new job?

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:35.700

00:11:13.810 --> 00:11:15.200
what position could I take?

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:17.120
That depends on what you want.

We're currently hiring

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:19.540

better suited for...

00:11:41.390 --> 00:11:42.360
after work every day,

00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:44.090

00:11:45.510 --> 00:11:46.510

00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:48.010
What's so good about that?

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:49.960
What if some big boss
takes a liking to you?

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:52.160
Wouldn't that be a shortcut to success?

00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:54.360
Is this how you

00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:55.980

00:11:56.460 --> 00:11:57.190
Yeah.

00:11:57.210 --> 00:11:58.360
If the boss is happy,

00:11:58.510 --> 00:11:59.870
then I've done my job.

00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:02.840
Then this job really
isn't suitable for me.

00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:04.750
It's hard to get by these days.

00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:05.840

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:07.170
I'll go look elsewhere.

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:32.450
Didn't I tell you last time?

00:12:32.450 --> 00:12:33.650
It's not optimistic.

00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:35.860
So, have you found one?

00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:36.860
Not yet.

00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:39.470
Did you offend someone?

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:41.910
There's a guy behind you staring at you

00:12:41.910 --> 00:12:42.790
and smirking.

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:46.890
You know him?

00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:53.870
Professor Xiang,

00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:55.670
I've been watching you.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:56.790
You've been to 7 or 8 places.

00:12:56.790 --> 00:12:58.830
How does it feel to be refused repeatedly?

00:12:58.830 --> 00:12:59.710
Cut the crap.

00:13:00.050 --> 00:13:01.250
Get me a soda quickly.

00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:02.350
I'm dying of thirst.

00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:03.240
When you left my place,

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:04.150
didn't you take a bunch?

00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:05.200
I finished them.

00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:06.080
Hurry up.

00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:08.510

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:10.440
I want a new one.

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:21.130
Miss,

00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:22.060
have a soda.

00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:22.980
Thank you.

You're here job-hunting too?

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:27.200
Yes, I am.

00:13:27.450 --> 00:13:28.900
Let me introduce myself.

00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:33.030
Xiang Beichuan and I
were college classmates.

00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:33.630
Hello.

00:13:33.650 --> 00:13:34.380
Hello.

00:13:34.490 --> 00:13:35.490
Although we were classmates,

00:13:35.490 --> 00:13:37.420
there are differences between us.

00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:40.190
I'm the boss of this company.

00:13:40.190 --> 00:13:41.470
I'm here today

00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:42.870
to recruit people,

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:44.120
while he's here

00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:45.140
to apply for a job.

00:13:46.370 --> 00:13:47.840
But he does have his strengths.

00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:49.480
For example, when we were in school,

00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:51.370
his grades were slightly better than mine.

00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:52.300
Other than that,

00:13:52.670 --> 00:13:55.400
I'm probably better than him
in everything else.

00:13:56.550 --> 00:13:57.670
Our company

00:13:58.080 --> 00:13:59.550
is a foreign trade business.

00:13:59.550 --> 00:14:01.550
We deal with light industrial
imports and exports

00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:03.000
and also some pet trade.

00:14:03.410 --> 00:14:05.140
We currently need a secretary.

00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:06.860
Are you interested, miss?

00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:07.650
Secretary?

00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:11.670
Does that mean
I'd have to accompany the boss

00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:13.360
for meals, drinks,
and business entertainment?

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:14.150
Can you hold your liquor?

00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:15.320
I can't drink much.

00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:16.760
I get rowdy and talk nonsense

00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:17.960
when I drink too much.

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:20.240
Beichuan, see you.

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:21.100
I'm leaving now.

00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:22.160
Thank you, Mr. Yan.

00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:31.040
What?

00:14:31.230 --> 00:14:32.290
What are you doing?

00:14:32.910 --> 00:14:35.700
You can't take your eyes
off a pretty girl, can you?

00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:36.960
Bros before hoes, man.

00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:40.000
Let me ask you something.

00:14:40.270 --> 00:14:41.510
In that company of yours,

00:14:41.510 --> 00:14:42.320
besides me,

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:43.630
is there anyone else?

00:14:44.590 --> 00:14:46.000
You need a secretary?

00:14:47.270 --> 00:14:49.100
I think what you need isn't a secretary,

00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:50.250
but a girlfriend.

00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:51.270
Come on.

00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:53.840
Don't you think that girl

00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:55.150
is really pretty?

00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:57.200
Long hair,

00:14:57.430 --> 00:14:58.280
big curls,

00:14:58.300 --> 00:14:59.140
fair skin—

00:14:59.750 --> 00:15:01.600
I can't help staring
when I see girls like that.

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:03.270
Hurry up and get me a soda.

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:04.200
You hear me?

00:15:07.410 --> 00:15:08.240
Get me a new one.

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:10.240
She hasn't had a sip. I was watching.

00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:16.500
How does that girl have
such perfect teeth?

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:25.150
Miss Ye.

00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:28.030
Mr. Lu.

00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:28.910
Let's go.

00:15:28.910 --> 00:15:29.840
Let's sit down somewhere.

00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:31.120
I'll buy you a coffee.

00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:32.020
Sure.

00:15:32.050 --> 00:15:32.580
Let's go.

00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:37.650
Watch your step.

00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:38.690
Come.

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:43.060
Let me do it.

00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:44.830
Don't worry, it won't spill.

00:15:44.830 --> 00:15:45.490
Have a seat.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:50.790
Thanks.

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:54.910
Miss Ye,

00:15:55.450 --> 00:15:56.790
long time no see.

00:15:56.810 --> 00:15:57.840
It's been a while.

00:15:57.870 --> 00:15:59.200
Didn't expect to run into you today.

00:15:59.200 --> 00:15:59.750
Yes.

00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:01.350
I'm so happy to see you today.

00:16:02.650 --> 00:16:03.650
Let me update you.

00:16:04.750 --> 00:16:06.270
Our state-owned factory

00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:09.310
eventually went bankrupt.

00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:11.320
But I took out a loan

00:16:11.630 --> 00:16:13.320
and bought the factory back.

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:14.960
Together with our workers,

00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:16.490
we're doing quite well now.

00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:19.020
Since I ran into you today,

00:16:19.310 --> 00:16:21.080
I'd like to invite you to our company.

00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:22.250
Let's make it bigger

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:23.650
and stronger together.

00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:26.270
Mr. Lu,

00:16:27.570 --> 00:16:29.600
there's something you might not know.

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:31.750
I've just been fired from my job.

00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:33.970
And do you know what
they're saying about me?

00:16:33.970 --> 00:16:35.550
They're all saying I neglected my duties.

00:16:35.550 --> 00:16:38.400
Right now I've got
no government resources, no connections.

00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:40.150
I can't help you with anything anymore.

00:16:40.150 --> 00:16:41.320
I heard about it.

00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:43.410
It wasn't your fault.

00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:45.390
You were wronged.

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:48.800
Those leaders of yours are just idiots.

00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:52.400
But it's still a big impact.

00:16:53.550 --> 00:16:54.320
Yes.

00:16:54.630 --> 00:16:56.480
I used to work in the system too.

00:16:57.870 --> 00:16:59.750
I really understand how you feel.

00:17:00.750 --> 00:17:02.610
Suddenly losing your secure job,

00:17:02.650 --> 00:17:03.740
you must feel

00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:04.819
wronged

00:17:05.710 --> 00:17:06.710
and lost.

00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:08.640
So we're planning

00:17:08.829 --> 00:17:10.430
to invite you to our company.

00:17:10.839 --> 00:17:12.190
2,000 yuan per month

00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:13.640
plus commission.

00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:14.640
What do you think?

00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:18.400
That's too much. I...

00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:19.660
What would I even

00:17:19.690 --> 00:17:20.609
do there?

00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:21.630
It's not too much.

00:17:26.290 --> 00:17:26.890
Well,

00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:29.590
back when

00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:31.350
our factory was

00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:33.330
going through its toughest times,

00:17:33.550 --> 00:17:34.410
you were the one

00:17:35.030 --> 00:17:36.030
who helped us out.

00:17:37.690 --> 00:17:39.550
All of us remember your kindness.

00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:41.080
No, Mr. Lu,

00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:44.030
I really appreciate your invitation

00:17:44.030 --> 00:17:44.710
and

00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:46.770
offering me 2,000 yuan per month.

00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:49.440
But if this is the reason,

00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:50.200
if you want to

00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:52.130
help me when I'm at my lowest point,

00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:53.750
I think it's really unfair to you,

00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:55.480
and I don't accept this kind of pity.

00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:56.240
No, no, no.

00:17:56.740 --> 00:17:58.540
I must have explained it poorly.

00:17:59.110 --> 00:18:00.750
We actually value

00:18:00.790 --> 00:18:02.730
your professional skills, Miss Ye.

00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:04.100
We've seen it.

00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:05.880
You majored

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.630
in foreign languages, right?

00:18:07.630 --> 00:18:08.430
Yes.

00:18:08.510 --> 00:18:09.480
Our company is now

00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:11.240
about to expand into international trade.

00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:13.480
Foreign language talents
are exactly what we need most.

00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:14.790
Look at you, you're beautiful,

00:18:14.790 --> 00:18:15.110
aren't you?

00:18:15.110 --> 00:18:16.790
And you have excellent
interpersonal skills.

00:18:16.790 --> 00:18:17.640
If you join our company,

00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:19.970
you'll definitely be like a fish in water.

00:18:21.290 --> 00:18:22.010
Alright.

00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:22.770
Then I'll...

00:18:23.950 --> 00:18:25.000
I'll think about it.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:25.480
Good.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.610
Then it's settled for now.

00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:29.070
I haven't decided yet.

00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:30.640
Cheers.

Based on your accommodation requirements,

00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:52.340
the room doesn't need to be big,

close to the company,

00:18:54.610 --> 00:18:56.140
and preferably rent-free.

around the corner to the right.

00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:07.360
So convenient.

It's not appropriate
for me to live here, is it?

They operate during the day.

00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:32.790
So you mean

00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:35.410
during the day I work at your company,

00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:36.880
and at night after they close,

Try laying that chair flat.

00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:44.640
It's very comfy to lie on. I've tried it.

00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:46.110
Try it.

anything else,

Yes.

00:23:48.610 --> 00:23:49.930
within 2.5%.

00:23:50.470 --> 00:23:51.670
Let me put it this way.

00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:52.880
We have 20

00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:54.790
German-made rapier looms.

00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:55.720
Rapier looms?

00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:56.350
Yes,

00:23:56.550 --> 00:23:57.240
and also

00:23:57.240 --> 00:23:59.880
the latest imported
Japanese sewing machines.

00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:00.710
That's good.

00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:02.590
Those conditions are suitable.

00:24:02.590 --> 00:24:04.200
Today when I went back
to the Textile Bureau

00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:05.470
to pack up my belongings,

00:24:05.470 --> 00:24:06.440
accidentally,

00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:07.920
I just

00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:09.020
happened to

00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:11.570
overhear some business information.

00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:12.740
What information?

00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:14.350
Well...

00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:17.720
Tell me.

00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:19.480
Maybe I shouldn't say.

00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:20.440
Tell me.

00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:22.350
If I tell...

00:24:22.350 --> 00:24:23.410
Just say it boldly.

00:24:23.810 --> 00:24:24.870
I'd rather not say.

00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:27.070
Miss Ye,

00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:28.300
don't be like this.

00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:30.150
You can't just tell half the story

00:24:30.150 --> 00:24:31.350
and leave me hanging.

00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:34.110
Well, it's mainly because

00:24:34.110 --> 00:24:35.550
this is something someone else said.

00:24:35.550 --> 00:24:37.200
I heard it from someone else.

00:24:38.270 --> 00:24:39.030
Was it from

00:24:39.090 --> 00:24:40.240
Director Tian

00:24:40.790 --> 00:24:42.400
or Director Jin?

00:24:42.550 --> 00:24:43.480
Neither of them.

00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:44.550
Then who?

00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:46.920
Wang Li.

00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:48.270
Wang Li? That Li?

00:24:48.850 --> 00:24:50.050
Keep your voice down.

00:24:50.110 --> 00:24:50.970
Let me tell you,

00:24:51.730 --> 00:24:53.400
she's the worst of them all.

00:24:54.590 --> 00:24:56.070
She's two-faced,

00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:57.560
always trying to trip us up.

00:24:57.560 --> 00:24:58.360
Really?

00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:00.510
She's absolutely unforgivable,

00:25:00.510 --> 00:25:01.960
the most wicked person ever.

00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:03.090
In your department,

00:25:03.110 --> 00:25:03.770
there's her

00:25:04.020 --> 00:25:04.750
and Director Jin.

00:25:04.750 --> 00:25:05.830
These two are the absolute worst.

00:25:05.830 --> 00:25:06.760
I'm telling you.

00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:07.800
They make me so angry.

00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:09.000
Calm down, calm down.

00:25:09.990 --> 00:25:11.600
I didn't know it was this serious.

00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:13.880
So would you say
that by telling you this now,

00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:15.540
I'm avenging the bad person
on behalf of the people?

00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:16.350
Avenge her.

00:25:16.370 --> 00:25:16.770
Okay.

00:25:17.260 --> 00:25:18.120
It's like this.

00:25:18.270 --> 00:25:19.670
Our Textile Bureau

00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:22.720
has been in contact with an American

00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:24.380
jeans manufacturer's agent.

00:25:24.510 --> 00:25:26.470
We're finding them a contract factory.

00:25:26.470 --> 00:25:28.360
This time they've made

00:25:28.380 --> 00:25:29.530
a huge request.

00:25:30.170 --> 00:25:31.780
They want to produce in one go

00:25:32.410 --> 00:25:33.140
this many.

00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:34.320
500?

00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:37.070
5,000 pairs.

00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:40.350
Wow, 5,000 pairs!

00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:44.460
We're going to be rich!

00:25:44.770 --> 00:25:47.050
You're really our God of Wealth!

00:25:47.110 --> 00:25:47.880
Goddess of Wealth.

00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:48.480
Goddess.

00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:50.440
Goddess of Wealth, indeed!

00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:51.570
Only if it works out.

00:25:51.750 --> 00:25:52.900
You will be when it works out,

00:25:52.900 --> 00:25:54.120
and even if it doesn't, you still are.

00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:55.480
This big business of yours!

00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:56.960
Then I'll treat you
to coffee every day after that.

00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:57.550
No, no, no.

00:25:57.550 --> 00:25:58.640
When that happens,
I'll be the one treating.

00:25:58.640 --> 00:25:59.970
The coffee will be on me.

00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:02.350
Then I need to hurry
and secure this agent.

00:26:02.350 --> 00:26:03.020
Alright.

00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:04.310
Wait for my good news.

00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:05.070
Okay, okay.

00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:06.290
I'll go first.

00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:07.750
Miss Ye,

00:26:07.940 --> 00:26:10.200
you don't have a place to stay yet, right?

00:26:10.790 --> 00:26:11.440
Let's go to the company.

00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:12.750
The company has staff dormitories.

00:26:12.750 --> 00:26:13.550
Staff dormitories?

00:26:13.550 --> 00:26:14.240
Let's go.

00:26:14.350 --> 00:26:14.800
Let's go.

00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:15.200
Come on.

00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:15.790
Give it to me.

00:26:15.790 --> 00:26:16.740
No need. It's fine. I'll do it.

00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:17.500
You lead the way.

00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:17.960
Let's go.

00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:18.490
Let's go.

00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:24.280
Let me do it.

00:26:24.310 --> 00:26:25.570
My stuff is a bit heavy.

00:26:26.020 --> 00:26:26.830
Careful.

00:26:29.270 --> 00:26:29.800
Let's go.

00:26:30.610 --> 00:26:31.480
Let's go.

00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:35.400
Please.

00:26:37.690 --> 00:26:40.380
This used to be
Huang Yahui's marital home.

00:26:40.410 --> 00:26:42.370
I rented it a few days ago

00:26:42.630 --> 00:26:44.230
and turned it into an office.

00:26:44.290 --> 00:26:45.150
Please come in.

00:26:49.610 --> 00:26:51.370
Huang Yahui had poor fortune.

00:26:51.750 --> 00:26:52.770
She couldn't handle it.

00:26:52.770 --> 00:26:53.830
You're different.

00:26:54.310 --> 00:26:55.750
I feel that you and this apartment

00:26:55.750 --> 00:26:57.150
have compatible energy.

00:26:58.170 --> 00:26:59.200
I've also heard

00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:00.990
that the women who lived here before

00:27:00.990 --> 00:27:02.190
were all remarkable.

00:27:03.310 --> 00:27:04.440
Except Huang Yahui.

00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:05.270
Actually,

00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:07.240
she never really lived here.

00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:10.270
I know all the women

00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:11.260
who lived here.

00:27:12.060 --> 00:27:12.910
That's why

00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:16.770
I think you and this place
truly have compatible energy.

00:27:17.370 --> 00:27:17.930
Please.

00:27:18.270 --> 00:27:18.790
You can

00:27:19.350 --> 00:27:20.240
work outside

00:27:22.030 --> 00:27:22.960
and live inside.

00:27:23.540 --> 00:27:25.870
This is a suite
with inner and outer rooms.

00:27:27.170 --> 00:27:28.430
Why are there two beds?

00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:31.160
Our company

00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:32.530
is still quite small

00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:33.830
and we can't afford

00:27:33.830 --> 00:27:35.430
private rooms for everyone.

00:27:36.170 --> 00:27:37.130
To be honest,

00:27:37.310 --> 00:27:39.370
it's only because Huang Yahui ran off

00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:41.310
that the landlord offered a discount

00:27:41.310 --> 00:27:42.770
and thus I could afford it.

00:27:43.830 --> 00:27:44.720
Mr. Lu,

00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:47.030
but I haven't secured the order yet.

00:27:47.150 --> 00:27:47.830
Yet I...

00:27:48.230 --> 00:27:48.720
Yet I...

00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:49.720
It's fine.

00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:51.970
Just make yourself at home.

00:27:52.270 --> 00:27:52.750
Come on.

00:27:53.510 --> 00:27:54.830
Get yourself settled in.

00:27:54.830 --> 00:27:55.350
Okay.

00:27:56.420 --> 00:27:57.050
Goodbye.

00:27:57.480 --> 00:27:58.280
Take care.

00:27:58.530 --> 00:27:59.200
Goodbye.

00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:08.000
Grandma.

00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:11.440
I'm now in the room where you once lived.

00:28:38.350 --> 00:28:39.280
Xiang Beichuan?

00:28:40.550 --> 00:28:41.800
What are you doing here?

00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:42.600
Miss Ye.

00:28:44.070 --> 00:28:45.830
Yan Jun's company is right next door.

00:28:45.830 --> 00:28:47.360
I live in the room opposite.

00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:49.360
So you went to work for Yan Jun?

00:28:50.250 --> 00:28:51.910
I finally accepted his offer.

00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:53.500
What about you?

00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:54.590
I found a job too.

00:28:54.590 --> 00:28:55.510
I work here

00:28:55.530 --> 00:28:56.530
and live inside.

00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:00.160
So we're neighbors now,

00:29:00.180 --> 00:29:01.310
living quite close.

00:29:01.370 --> 00:29:03.100
We can see each other every day.

00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:04.110
Indeed.

00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:12.560
Are you feeling awkward?

00:29:12.780 --> 00:29:13.690
Or a bit

00:29:13.790 --> 00:29:14.590
embarrassed?

00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:15.960
No.

00:29:16.270 --> 00:29:17.870
Why did you come to this room?

00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:21.300
I just had a sudden urge to come see it.

00:29:21.830 --> 00:29:23.110
Mainly to...

00:29:24.350 --> 00:29:25.350
Pay my respects to

00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:27.250
the place that changed my fate.

00:29:27.310 --> 00:29:29.200
You Chinese literature majors
are so dramatic.

00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:30.270
"Pay respects"?

00:29:30.690 --> 00:29:31.920
Did you bring a wreath?

00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:32.730
No.

00:29:33.550 --> 00:29:35.110
This place is unlucky enough as it is.

00:29:35.110 --> 00:29:36.310
I'm a materialist.

00:29:36.310 --> 00:29:37.840
I'm living here. So what?

00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:39.720
I don't believe in that nonsense.

00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:41.290
Let's go in and take a look.

00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:43.410
You live here now.
Is it okay if I come in?

00:29:43.410 --> 00:29:44.610
It's broad daylight.

00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:45.850
What can you do to me?

00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:46.340
Come on.

00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:01.980
Do you think your friend Shang Yunfei

00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:03.840
deliberately wanted to harm you?

00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:06.270
Well...

00:30:08.140 --> 00:30:10.200
If I judge his motives by the results,

00:30:10.750 --> 00:30:12.350
then I think he probably did.

00:30:13.060 --> 00:30:14.860
But this also indirectly proves

00:30:15.550 --> 00:30:17.550
that I'm truly a complete idiot.

00:30:18.590 --> 00:30:19.450
What about you?

00:30:19.530 --> 00:30:20.760
Do you think Huang Yahui

00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:22.090
deliberately hurt you?

00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:24.040
I definitely don't think so.

00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:26.440
I've always felt Yahui was a victim.

00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:28.110
She just loved that man too much

00:30:28.110 --> 00:30:29.510
and got lost in love.

00:30:30.390 --> 00:30:31.500
That's why

00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:33.160
a woman should never

00:30:33.270 --> 00:30:34.550
entrust her fate

00:30:34.550 --> 00:30:35.680
to love.

00:30:37.620 --> 00:30:38.210
True.

00:30:39.420 --> 00:30:41.030
Men shouldn't entrust their fate

00:30:41.030 --> 00:30:42.000
to love either.

00:30:43.250 --> 00:30:43.850
By the way,

00:30:44.150 --> 00:30:46.880
do you know which bed
Huang Yahui used to sleep in?

00:30:47.170 --> 00:30:47.760
This one.

00:30:48.310 --> 00:30:48.920
Why?

00:30:56.100 --> 00:30:57.160
What are you doing?

You...

Didn't you just say

00:30:59.030 --> 00:31:00.550
I should pay my respects?

00:31:01.030 --> 00:31:03.480
Isn't this part of the necessary ritual?

00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:04.630
I'm still alive!

00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:06.550
This is so creepy,

00:31:06.550 --> 00:31:07.680
bowing like that.

Just get out of here.

Bowing like that in broad daylight

00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:16.220
is really terrifying.

00:31:16.310 --> 00:31:18.480

producing 5,000 pairs of high-end jeans.

00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:23.300
And the craftsmanship requirements
are also very high.

00:36:23.300 --> 00:36:24.780
I happen to know a factory

that I believe
can fully meet your requirements.

How did you find out about it?

Mr. Li.

00:36:36.140 --> 00:36:37.750
Our industry is quite small.

Mr. Li.

00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:48.860
I completely understand your concerns.

00:36:48.860 --> 00:36:49.420
Although I've

00:36:49.420 --> 00:36:51.070
left the factory,

00:36:51.170 --> 00:36:52.360
I don't think that affects

00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:54.890
the quality of work
this factory can produce.

00:36:56.010 --> 00:36:56.820
Ye,

00:36:58.280 --> 00:36:59.150
to be honest,

00:36:59.510 --> 00:37:01.840
we already have manufacturing partners.

00:37:01.910 --> 00:37:02.440
And actually,

00:37:02.440 --> 00:37:04.400
we've almost finalized an agreement

00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:05.660
with another factory.

00:37:06.170 --> 00:37:08.500
We've worked with them many times before.

00:37:08.750 --> 00:37:10.190
The key is that their price

00:37:10.190 --> 00:37:11.320
is very reasonable.

00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:12.280
I understand.

00:37:12.290 --> 00:37:13.420
I completely get it.

00:37:13.550 --> 00:37:14.440
If I were in your position,

00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:15.590
for stability,

00:37:15.590 --> 00:37:18.450
I'd also choose suppliers
I've worked with before.

00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:19.630
However,

00:37:19.650 --> 00:37:21.780
our advantage lies in our technology.

00:37:22.030 --> 00:37:22.960
Our technology

00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:24.880
ensures the pre-shrinkage rate of jeans

00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:27.280
remains consistently within 2.5%.

00:37:27.630 --> 00:37:30.150
This means higher pass rate
for finished garments

00:37:30.150 --> 00:37:32.070
and lower return rates later on.

00:37:33.060 --> 00:37:33.860
Go on.

00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:35.440
Moreover, our factory

00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:37.960
has imported many German rapier looms

00:37:37.980 --> 00:37:39.510
and Japanese sewing machines.

00:37:39.510 --> 00:37:40.710
With this equipment,

00:37:40.780 --> 00:37:42.700
we can complete orders on time

00:37:42.730 --> 00:37:44.860
while ensuring quality and quantity.

00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:52.070

00:37:53.890 --> 00:37:56.100

00:37:56.630 --> 00:37:58.280
is quite appealing to me.

00:37:59.790 --> 00:38:00.920
Here's what I'll do.

00:38:01.010 --> 00:38:03.010
I'll discuss this with my team

00:38:03.550 --> 00:38:04.550
and we'll see

00:38:04.630 --> 00:38:05.480
if we need

00:38:05.480 --> 00:38:07.150
to switch to a new supplier.

00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:08.810
Sure, no problem.

00:38:09.460 --> 00:38:10.270
Mr. Li,

00:38:10.290 --> 00:38:11.730
if you'd like to know more

00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:14.230
or visit our factory
to see the production equipment,

00:38:14.230 --> 00:38:15.340
please contact me anytime.

00:38:15.340 --> 00:38:16.670
We welcome you at any time.

00:38:16.670 --> 00:38:17.150
Okay.

00:38:17.530 --> 00:38:19.010
I'll be in touch.

00:38:19.630 --> 00:38:20.030
Okay.

00:38:20.070 --> 00:38:20.600
Alright.

00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:25.420
While we're fighting, you throw stones.

00:38:25.420 --> 00:38:27.680
While we're fighting, you throw stones.

00:38:27.690 --> 00:38:29.730
How mean can you be?

00:38:30.510 --> 00:38:33.150
You're not sleeping
in the middle of the night,

00:38:33.150 --> 00:38:34.940
burning the midnight oil,

00:38:34.970 --> 00:38:36.810
just to torment people.

00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:42.160
You old swordsman.

00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:44.880
You know quite a lot.

00:38:45.630 --> 00:38:47.470
Let me make myself clear.

00:38:48.990 --> 00:38:50.720
I won't fight over it.

00:38:52.710 --> 00:38:54.310
It's the middle of the night!

00:38:55.220 --> 00:38:55.900
You...

00:38:57.250 --> 00:38:58.040
Jiuling.

00:38:58.910 --> 00:39:00.510
Could you please keep it down?

00:39:00.510 --> 00:39:02.510
I'm still organizing my materials.

00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:14.550
♪ New Year ♪

00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:17.970
♪ The first day ♪

00:39:19.550 --> 00:39:21.070
♪ Reunite ♪

00:39:21.100 --> 00:39:24.220
♪ The young pay
New Year's greetings to the elders ♪

00:39:24.690 --> 00:39:25.430
I switched to another one.

00:39:25.430 --> 00:39:26.560
Do you like this one?

00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:33.770
♪ Wear the new clothes ♪

00:39:36.050 --> 00:39:38.740
♪ Wear the new clothes ♪

00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:06.840
Professor Xiang.

00:40:07.070 --> 00:40:08.000
Still awake?

00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:09.150
Miss Ye.

00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:10.850
May I come in and take a look?

00:40:11.270 --> 00:40:12.800
Miss Ye, it's so late. Uh...

00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:15.190
Your room is really small.

00:40:15.790 --> 00:40:17.230
And so many books.

00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:20.880
Why is there a dog cage?

00:40:21.240 --> 00:40:21.830
Don't tell me

00:40:21.830 --> 00:40:23.630
Mr. Yan makes you live with a dog.

00:40:25.550 --> 00:40:26.400
No.

00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:28.030
Not yet, anyway.

00:40:29.590 --> 00:40:31.360
A grown man like you
sleeping in such a narrow bed.

00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:32.820
It's really unfair to you.

00:40:33.880 --> 00:40:34.670
It's fine.

00:40:34.670 --> 00:40:35.360
Well,

00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:36.670
as long as it's long enough.

00:40:36.670 --> 00:40:37.440
I couldn't handle it.

00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:39.190
I toss and turn a lot when I sleep.

00:40:39.190 --> 00:40:40.230
And when I dream,

00:40:40.230 --> 00:40:41.960
especially when it's a nightmare,
I'd definitely fall off

00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:43.760
and crash right onto this table.

00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:46.590
What are you cooking?

00:40:47.660 --> 00:40:49.080
I got hungry while reading.

00:40:49.080 --> 00:40:50.260
Just cooking some instant noodles...

00:40:50.260 --> 00:40:51.660
I'm actually hungry too.

00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:52.800
I only bought one pack.

00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:54.390
Probably not enough for both of us.

00:40:54.390 --> 00:40:55.350
It's okay.

00:40:55.890 --> 00:40:56.630
I don't eat much.

00:40:56.630 --> 00:40:58.290
Can't I just have half of this?

00:40:58.430 --> 00:40:59.230
Alright.

00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:03.880
Don't sit on that chair.

00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:05.070
You scared me!

00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:06.560
What's wrong with it?

00:41:06.830 --> 00:41:07.920
The screws underneath are loose.

00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:09.180
I haven't fixed it yet.

00:41:10.390 --> 00:41:11.990
If I break it, I'll pay for it.

00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:13.120
That's not it.

00:41:13.590 --> 00:41:15.120
I'm worried if you sit on it,

00:41:15.230 --> 00:41:15.920
you might fall and hurt yourself,

00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:17.710
then I'd have to compensate you.

00:41:17.710 --> 00:41:18.810
You wouldn't need to compensate me.

00:41:18.810 --> 00:41:20.610
I'm already up to my neck in debt.

00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:22.550
Aren't you in debt too?

00:41:24.970 --> 00:41:26.030
Speaking of which,

00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:28.080
we have quite a lot in common.

00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:30.280
Both of us down on our luck.

00:41:31.850 --> 00:41:33.570
But at least that's all behind us now.

00:41:33.570 --> 00:41:35.010
We both found jobs

00:41:35.110 --> 00:41:37.070
and even became neighbors
in this building.

00:41:37.070 --> 00:41:38.950
Shouldn't we celebrate this?

00:41:40.370 --> 00:41:41.210
Celebrate?

00:41:41.300 --> 00:41:42.900
We should toast to this!

00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:45.070
Toast?

00:41:45.180 --> 00:41:46.270
Get a bowl.

00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:54.850
Well, the noodles...

00:41:54.850 --> 00:41:55.730
Serve some.

00:41:57.360 --> 00:41:58.190
Thank you.

00:41:59.550 --> 00:42:00.400
Professor Xiang.

00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:02.230
You're so cultured
with your Chinese literature background.

00:42:02.230 --> 00:42:03.760
Shouldn't you say something profound?

00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:05.360
In Gorky's
"The Song of the Stormy Petrel,"

00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:06.960
there's a line that goes...

00:42:10.030 --> 00:42:10.840
It says,

00:42:12.230 --> 00:42:14.550
when people face life's difficulties,

00:42:15.110 --> 00:42:17.030
they should be like the stormy petrel,

00:42:17.030 --> 00:42:18.430
flying toward the storm,

00:42:18.540 --> 00:42:20.070
and soaring with outstretched wings.

00:42:20.070 --> 00:42:20.800
That's it!

00:42:21.310 --> 00:42:22.690
To us, two stormy petrels!

00:42:22.690 --> 00:42:24.620
Soaring with outstretched wings.

00:42:32.570 --> 00:42:33.300
Delicious.

00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:39.360
Professor Xiang.

00:42:39.860 --> 00:42:41.590
I must say, you're quite brave.

00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:44.400
This kind of stove

00:42:44.610 --> 00:42:45.870
can easily catch fire.

00:42:46.090 --> 00:42:47.560
This room could go up in flames,

00:42:47.560 --> 00:42:49.280
and you could burn down
the whole building.

00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:50.480
That's a bit extreme.

00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:51.960
How is it extreme?

00:42:53.100 --> 00:42:54.430
At our school before,

00:42:55.480 --> 00:42:56.690
because of this type of stove,

00:42:56.690 --> 00:42:57.640
two people died.

00:42:59.190 --> 00:43:01.360
And they were also eating noodles.

00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:04.280
Instant noodles, too.

00:43:05.220 --> 00:43:05.900
One guy

00:43:06.190 --> 00:43:06.920
and one girl.

00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:09.360
The guy was also

00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:11.090
sitting on a bed just like this.

00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:13.480
And the girl had hair
the same length as mine...

00:43:13.480 --> 00:43:14.080
Fine.

00:43:14.100 --> 00:43:14.970
Stop talking. Please stop.

00:43:14.970 --> 00:43:16.300
I'll unplug it right now.
