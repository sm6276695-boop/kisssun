YOU AND EVERYTHING ELSE

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.343
Please join Cheerleading Club!

00:00:52.427 --> 00:00:54.888
One, two, let's go! One, two…

00:00:54.971 --> 00:00:56.931
You just might be the lucky one!

00:00:57.515 --> 00:00:59.642
We're Game Club!

00:01:04.272 --> 00:01:07.150
We're Photography Club!

00:01:07.233 --> 00:01:08.610
MAGIC HOUR PHOTOGRAPHY CLUB

00:01:09.569 --> 00:01:12.864
First, you can sign up for our registry…

00:01:14.324 --> 00:01:18.620
If I learn photography here,
would I be able to develop this roll?

00:01:18.703 --> 00:01:20.580
Absolutely!

00:01:21.081 --> 00:01:23.500
You're a freshman. Class of 2001, right?

00:01:23.583 --> 00:01:24.417
Yes.

00:01:28.088 --> 00:01:29.631
Isn't that Sang-hak?

00:01:29.714 --> 00:01:31.633
You're right. It is.

00:01:31.716 --> 00:01:33.051
Hey, Sang-hak!

00:02:01.204 --> 00:02:03.665
You sure took your damn time.

00:02:04.165 --> 00:02:05.667
-Hey, man.
-Hey.

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.294
-How's the turnout?
-This freshman brought a Tri-X roll.

00:02:08.378 --> 00:02:11.131
She couldn't develop the film.
Why don't you take a look?

00:02:11.214 --> 00:02:12.048
Sure.

00:02:14.092 --> 00:02:15.844
Can I have a look at the Tri-X roll?

00:02:20.598 --> 00:02:23.309
I hear you brought film
and asked if we could develop it.

00:02:27.605 --> 00:02:28.565
It's this.

00:02:32.443 --> 00:02:33.778
Did you study photography?

00:02:34.696 --> 00:02:35.530
No.

00:02:35.613 --> 00:02:37.490
Then where did you get this from?

00:02:43.454 --> 00:02:44.414
I've just

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.167
had it for a long time.

00:02:49.961 --> 00:02:52.881
Sorry for bombarding you with questions
before an introduction.

00:02:52.964 --> 00:02:55.341
I'm Kim Sang-hak.
Business management. Class of 2000.

00:03:01.347 --> 00:03:02.182
Never mind.

00:03:24.871 --> 00:03:27.248
I'm Kim Sang-hak.
Business management. Class of 2000.

00:03:30.084 --> 00:03:34.464
What significance does language have
in the way we think?

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.467
It allows us to distinguish concepts,

00:03:37.967 --> 00:03:40.428
conceptualize habitual actions,

00:03:41.679 --> 00:03:43.640
and generate new ideas.

00:03:43.723 --> 00:03:45.725
If we simplify the history of mankind…

00:03:47.352 --> 00:03:49.187
Room 207.

00:03:50.146 --> 00:03:51.397
"Understanding Language…"

00:03:53.816 --> 00:03:55.235
Room 207…

00:03:58.988 --> 00:03:59.864
Hurry up!

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:07.789
Hey, wait up!

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.141
Is everything all right?

00:04:27.225 --> 00:04:29.644
Did you see a film roll here?
A black-and-white one.

00:04:29.727 --> 00:04:32.188
Did you lose that Tri-X roll
you had earlier?

00:04:32.272 --> 00:04:33.106
Yes.

00:04:33.856 --> 00:04:35.650
There's no other place it could be.

00:04:41.823 --> 00:04:43.658
Sure seems like it's super important.

00:04:43.741 --> 00:04:45.868
You ran off so quickly
you didn't hear me call you.

00:04:48.162 --> 00:04:49.122
Thank you.

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:51.791
Take a seat if you're grateful.

00:04:55.628 --> 00:04:56.462
Please.

00:05:00.842 --> 00:05:01.718
Come on.

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:05.555
The least you can do
is finish what you started writing.

00:05:08.933 --> 00:05:13.062
I had to go to the humanities office
and your lecture hall because of this.

00:05:15.148 --> 00:05:16.232
I'm sorry.

00:05:16.733 --> 00:05:20.236
You'll understand better next year,
but freshmen are rare in our club.

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:23.698
Everyone kept harping on at me
about how I scared you off.

00:05:25.074 --> 00:05:27.368
-You didn't.
-Right?

00:05:28.036 --> 00:05:29.537
Did you guys hear that?

00:05:30.121 --> 00:05:32.415
-Yeah, congrats.
-Why else would she run away?

00:05:32.915 --> 00:05:35.043
REGISTRATION FORM
RYU EUN-JUNG

00:05:35.626 --> 00:05:37.879
Once you're done,
I'll drop the formalities.

00:05:41.341 --> 00:05:42.175
I haven't

00:05:43.134 --> 00:05:45.094
finished filling out the form just yet.

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:51.517
I apologize.
Please go ahead and fill it out.

00:05:58.441 --> 00:06:00.777
DATE OF BIRTH: 1982…

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:02.612
ADDRESS: GYEONGGI-DO, ILYEONG

00:06:02.695 --> 00:06:04.697
TO LEARN HOW TO DEVELOP
BLACK-AND-WHITE FILM…

00:06:04.781 --> 00:06:07.367
It's Magic Hour. Welcome.

00:06:16.084 --> 00:06:17.960
We're Magic Hour, the photography club.

00:06:21.422 --> 00:06:22.423
A long time ago,

00:06:23.216 --> 00:06:25.343
someone once told me this.

00:06:25.843 --> 00:06:28.137
This was shot with a shutter speed of 60,

00:06:28.221 --> 00:06:31.557
which means this photo captured
1/60 of a second.

00:06:32.058 --> 00:06:35.436
They said that although
time may appear frozen in a photograph,

00:06:36.354 --> 00:06:39.315
1/60th of a second lives on
in the photo forever.

00:06:40.942 --> 00:06:43.194
And so to take a photograph

00:06:43.861 --> 00:06:45.905
is to collect time.

00:07:58.811 --> 00:07:59.729
Hey, it's me.

00:08:02.106 --> 00:08:02.940
What?

00:08:03.691 --> 00:08:06.444
Sang-yeon. I'm outside,
so I can't hear you well.

00:08:07.445 --> 00:08:09.363
Say that again. What happened to Sang-hak?

00:08:11.699 --> 00:08:12.867
He's dead.

00:08:17.038 --> 00:08:18.748
Sang-hak's dead.

00:08:28.216 --> 00:08:32.678
CHUNGMURO

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:40.353
Could you lend this to me for one week?

00:08:40.436 --> 00:08:42.522
I promise to return it after that.

00:08:46.567 --> 00:08:49.820
That day, Sang-hak left home
early in the morning.

00:08:50.446 --> 00:08:52.990
Three days later,
they found him in the mountains.

00:09:16.597 --> 00:09:17.682
Eun-jung.

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:27.525
The first person to answer the call
from the police…

00:09:29.569 --> 00:09:30.903
was Sang-yeon.

00:09:48.629 --> 00:09:49.964
What's on your mind?

00:09:51.132 --> 00:09:52.800
-Hello.
-Hey.

00:09:53.301 --> 00:09:54.427
Is that a camera?

00:09:55.344 --> 00:09:58.180
-Yes. I just bought it today.
-Today?

00:09:58.681 --> 00:10:00.808
It's secondhand. I got it today.

00:10:01.475 --> 00:10:03.185
Can I have a look? What model is it?

00:10:04.186 --> 00:10:06.230
-FM2.
-I see.

00:10:06.731 --> 00:10:07.732
Shall we take a look?

00:10:11.527 --> 00:10:12.361
Sit here.

00:10:16.365 --> 00:10:17.658
How much did you pay for it?

00:10:18.284 --> 00:10:20.161
It was originally 370,000 won,

00:10:20.244 --> 00:10:23.831
but since I had to go pick it up,
the seller gave it to me for 350,000.

00:10:25.583 --> 00:10:26.751
350,000 won?

00:10:29.545 --> 00:10:32.089
And how far did you have to go
to pick it up?

00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:33.674
Uijeongbu.

00:10:33.758 --> 00:10:36.052
Uijeongbu? Yikes.

00:10:37.887 --> 00:10:38.929
Are you free right now?

00:10:39.972 --> 00:10:40.806
Yes.

00:11:04.789 --> 00:11:07.750
It seems to be in decent shape.
And the lens is clean.

00:11:08.751 --> 00:11:11.504
But this camera is fully manual.
Do you know how to use it?

00:11:13.673 --> 00:11:15.299
I learned how a long time ago.

00:11:16.717 --> 00:11:19.011
I learned everything
except how to change the film.

00:11:20.513 --> 00:11:21.681
Except changing the film?

00:11:23.891 --> 00:11:26.227
But you can adjust exposure
and shutter speed?

00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:27.144
Yes.

00:11:27.937 --> 00:11:28.771
Who was it?

00:11:29.355 --> 00:11:33.484
Who taught you how to use a camera
but skipped the part about changing rolls?

00:11:35.695 --> 00:11:36.570
Is it difficult?

00:11:37.071 --> 00:11:38.030
Do you have a roll?

00:11:42.952 --> 00:11:44.120
It's a Tri-X roll.

00:11:46.664 --> 00:11:49.625
So Tri-X carries around a Tri-X roll.

00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:55.005
The seller gave it to me as a freebie.

00:11:56.632 --> 00:11:59.510
To put the film in,
you just need to open the back cover.

00:11:59.593 --> 00:12:03.931
Look here.
You turn this lever counterclockwise,

00:12:04.014 --> 00:12:06.058
then lift this rewind knob.

00:12:07.309 --> 00:12:08.144
That's it.

00:12:10.563 --> 00:12:11.397
You got that?

00:12:20.072 --> 00:12:20.906
You're good.

00:12:23.492 --> 00:12:25.494
You then insert the film here

00:12:26.078 --> 00:12:28.789
and align these holes in the film…

00:12:30.875 --> 00:12:32.293
with these things here.

00:12:33.002 --> 00:12:34.754
Now turn the film advance lever

00:12:35.671 --> 00:12:36.881
to wind the film.

00:12:36.964 --> 00:12:37.798
Right.

00:12:38.758 --> 00:12:42.803
Lastly, make sure the film is
tightly loaded before you close the cover.

00:13:03.741 --> 00:13:05.075
From that moment on…

00:13:08.162 --> 00:13:09.705
I couldn't help myself.

00:13:13.918 --> 00:13:15.419
Whenever I would see him…

00:13:17.379 --> 00:13:18.881
I couldn't help but freeze.

00:13:22.635 --> 00:13:23.469
So,

00:13:24.804 --> 00:13:26.180
is it like a dragonfly net?

00:13:32.061 --> 00:13:34.230
To take a photograph
is to collect time, right?

00:13:37.858 --> 00:13:40.861
To take a photograph is to collect time.

00:13:44.865 --> 00:13:46.242
Collect lots of good moments.

00:13:46.951 --> 00:13:47.785
See you.

00:14:03.467 --> 00:14:06.262
Yes, well, the paper's stuck.

00:14:06.971 --> 00:14:09.098
The machine's not returning
my copier card.

00:14:16.605 --> 00:14:17.439
Hey!

00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:22.695
-Hello.
-Hi.

00:14:27.449 --> 00:14:29.201
That machine is broken, actually.

00:14:29.285 --> 00:14:30.327
Is it really?

00:14:30.828 --> 00:14:31.662
Yes.

00:14:53.976 --> 00:14:56.645
Do you need three copies
of each of these pages?

00:14:59.315 --> 00:15:00.149
Yes.

00:15:03.152 --> 00:15:05.696
Pretty impressive, huh? This is my turf.

00:15:10.326 --> 00:15:12.411
I mean,
I'm a work-study student this semester.

00:15:14.872 --> 00:15:15.998
Coming through.

00:15:27.301 --> 00:15:30.137
-I can do it.
-I'm just so helpful.

00:15:35.309 --> 00:15:36.143
Here you go.

00:15:38.771 --> 00:15:39.772
Thank you.

00:15:40.564 --> 00:15:42.483
Join the research team if you're grateful.

00:15:48.739 --> 00:15:52.034
The nicer he was to me,
the more timid I became.

00:15:55.079 --> 00:15:56.080
Please catch it!

00:15:59.917 --> 00:16:00.751
Thank you.

00:16:14.139 --> 00:16:15.641
-I'm so sorry!
-It's okay!

00:16:15.724 --> 00:16:18.394
I couldn't have made
a bigger fool of myself if I'd tried.

00:16:19.186 --> 00:16:20.270
How embarrassing!

00:16:20.771 --> 00:16:22.606
Let me be direct with you.

00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:26.443
You're right to be embarrassed,
but the people who saw won't care.

00:16:26.527 --> 00:16:29.697
-They probably thought it was funny.
-Yeah. I think it's cute.

00:16:30.864 --> 00:16:34.159
I know. The people watching
must have found it hilarious.

00:16:34.994 --> 00:16:36.078
That's not the problem.

00:16:36.996 --> 00:16:39.289
-Then what is?
-I just feel so awkward.

00:16:39.999 --> 00:16:41.792
I keep stumbling over my words.

00:16:42.292 --> 00:16:46.213
And when he said he'd take me out
to eat that day, I just ran away.

00:16:46.296 --> 00:16:49.008
So do you not like him?

00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:53.804
No.

00:16:53.887 --> 00:16:55.305
Then what's the issue?

00:16:55.389 --> 00:16:57.808
He offers to buy you food
and copies your papers for free.

00:16:57.891 --> 00:16:59.768
And he asked you to join his team.

00:16:59.852 --> 00:17:02.980
Exactly! Why am I like this
when he's being nice?

00:17:03.063 --> 00:17:05.983
So are you going to miss
the welcome party?

00:17:08.318 --> 00:17:09.862
Of course I want to go.

00:17:10.446 --> 00:17:12.573
-I want to go, but…
-Why are you so nervous?

00:17:13.157 --> 00:17:15.659
Just go. Go get wasted and ask him,

00:17:15.743 --> 00:17:18.412
"What's your deal?
Why do you make me feel this way?"

00:17:22.833 --> 00:17:24.418
Bottoms up!

00:17:31.216 --> 00:17:33.635
Ryu Eun-jung. Humanities.
Straight out of high school.

00:17:34.803 --> 00:17:36.513
Kim Nam-ju, you study engineering.

00:17:36.597 --> 00:17:40.142
Kwon Hyeon-guk. Class of 2000.
And you study German literature, right?

00:17:40.225 --> 00:17:42.936
Not Nam-ju. "Soo." It's Kim Nam-soo.

00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:44.229
-Kim Nam-soo.
-Right, soo.

00:17:44.313 --> 00:17:47.858
Now, let me introduce our club executives.

00:17:47.941 --> 00:17:49.610
Let's start with our treasurer.

00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:53.697
MAGIC HOUR NEWBIE WELCOME PARTY

00:17:53.781 --> 00:17:56.950
Hi, everyone.
I'm Park Kyu-ho, the treasurer.

00:17:57.576 --> 00:18:00.996
Do you see that guy over there?
The one wearing the hoodie.

00:18:01.538 --> 00:18:02.998
Finance sounds like a drag, huh?

00:18:03.082 --> 00:18:06.001
He also studies management.
He's in the same department as me.

00:18:06.502 --> 00:18:08.962
I've had my eye on him
since freshman orientation.

00:18:09.046 --> 00:18:12.049
Everyone says he's secretly
a photography major though.

00:18:12.132 --> 00:18:13.133
Next!

00:18:17.513 --> 00:18:19.765
-They're dating.
-What?

00:18:20.349 --> 00:18:22.935
The treasurer
and head of planning are dating.

00:18:24.144 --> 00:18:25.104
How do you know?

00:18:25.604 --> 00:18:28.690
He wiped dust off her hair
and even brushed it.

00:18:28.774 --> 00:18:30.484
It was totally smooth.

00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:33.821
It's a hidden talent of mine. Listen.

00:18:33.904 --> 00:18:37.491
It might look like
everyone's paying attention,

00:18:37.574 --> 00:18:40.077
but really, there's constant
back and forth. Of what?

00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:41.203
Of vibes.

00:18:48.877 --> 00:18:51.130
Hello. I'm Kim Sang-hak
from the research team.

00:18:54.424 --> 00:18:56.301
You can think of our research team

00:18:56.385 --> 00:18:59.304
as the embodiment of photography
in every aspect.

00:18:59.847 --> 00:19:01.974
From the technical aspects
of taking photos

00:19:02.057 --> 00:19:04.518
to development, printing, and history.

00:19:04.601 --> 00:19:08.188
Anyone with a genuine interest
in photography is welcome.

00:19:08.272 --> 00:19:10.899
That's me! I'll join the research team!

00:19:10.983 --> 00:19:12.776
-Who is that?
-We'd love to have you.

00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:15.863
And if any of you
are carrying around an old film roll

00:19:15.946 --> 00:19:19.658
in the hopes of getting it developed,
you should join us immediately.

00:19:19.741 --> 00:19:23.704
Come on, just go ahead and say
you want Tri-X to join you.

00:19:23.787 --> 00:19:24.746
Thanks for listening!

00:19:26.999 --> 00:19:28.333
What's Tri-X?

00:19:28.834 --> 00:19:30.210
You don't even know Tri-X?

00:19:31.128 --> 00:19:33.046
Tell me. What is it?

00:19:33.130 --> 00:19:35.340
-It's just--
-Oh my! Hey.

00:19:35.966 --> 00:19:39.428
Wow, you seem to be quite the drinker.

00:19:39.511 --> 00:19:42.222
I look forward to our time together.
Thank you!

00:19:50.772 --> 00:19:53.692
Hello. My name's Ryu Eun-jung--

00:19:53.775 --> 00:19:54.610
Tri-X!

00:19:59.615 --> 00:20:02.201
I'm a humanities major,
hoping to study Korean literature.

00:20:02.284 --> 00:20:05.120
-And you use Tri-X.
-Yes, she does!

00:20:05.621 --> 00:20:07.289
Nice to meet you!

00:20:07.372 --> 00:20:08.415
Welcome!

00:20:10.459 --> 00:20:14.004
Fold a finger
if your current GPA falls below 3.7.

00:20:15.005 --> 00:20:18.217
Why aren't you targeting the newbies?
Make them fold first.

00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:19.551
Those who are dating, fold.

00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:24.264
-How's that targeting the newbies?
-Exactly!

00:20:25.098 --> 00:20:27.517
Fold if you've kissed
within the past 24 hours.

00:20:30.062 --> 00:20:31.146
Seriously?

00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:32.689
Fold if you're handsome!

00:20:34.399 --> 00:20:35.817
That doesn't include you guys.

00:20:35.901 --> 00:20:37.778
Here I go. I'm folding!

00:20:39.154 --> 00:20:40.697
Now drink up!

00:20:45.702 --> 00:20:46.954
Keep going.

00:20:47.037 --> 00:20:48.455
Humanities, fold.

00:20:51.041 --> 00:20:52.584
We finally got Eun-jung.

00:20:52.668 --> 00:20:54.127
-Bottoms up!
-I'll drink for her.

00:20:58.548 --> 00:21:01.843
-Man, that's embarrassing!
-She doesn't like you!

00:21:04.221 --> 00:21:07.599
It's Eun-jung's turn now. Everyone hush.

00:21:07.683 --> 00:21:08.934
Non-freshmen, fold.

00:21:09.434 --> 00:21:10.811
Nice one, Ryu Eun-jung!

00:21:12.771 --> 00:21:14.523
-Bottoms up!
-Will you be okay?

00:21:14.606 --> 00:21:16.858
-Eun-jung's drinking!
-Drink up!

00:21:39.631 --> 00:21:40.716
Mom.

00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:43.260
How did I get home last night?

00:21:44.052 --> 00:21:47.097
You need to ask how you got home?
Way to go, Eun-jung.

00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:48.598
Nice going!

00:21:48.682 --> 00:21:50.142
It won't happen again.

00:21:50.642 --> 00:21:52.144
What time did I get in?

00:21:52.227 --> 00:21:54.771
I don't know! Maybe 2:00 a.m.

00:21:54.855 --> 00:21:57.024
The seniors from your club
brought you home.

00:21:57.524 --> 00:21:58.775
Seniors? Who?

00:21:59.276 --> 00:22:02.154
There was a girl called Cho something,

00:22:02.237 --> 00:22:03.697
and the other one was

00:22:04.197 --> 00:22:06.199
Sang-hyeok? Right, Sang-hyeok.

00:22:06.783 --> 00:22:08.410
And what did you say to them?

00:22:08.493 --> 00:22:09.953
What do you think I said?

00:22:10.037 --> 00:22:13.248
I gave them a piece of my mind
for getting you so drunk!

00:22:15.876 --> 00:22:19.046
There's rice porridge in the pot.
If that ever happens again, I swear…

00:22:43.653 --> 00:22:45.989
-Hello?
-Excuse me!

00:22:47.616 --> 00:22:48.533
Hello?

00:22:51.870 --> 00:22:53.663
How's the hangover?

00:22:55.290 --> 00:22:58.460
Fine. I heard that you brought me home.

00:22:58.543 --> 00:23:00.087
Did you totally black out?

00:23:01.505 --> 00:23:02.964
I think so…

00:23:03.673 --> 00:23:05.384
Don't you remember, "Excuse me"?

00:23:06.843 --> 00:23:08.220
"Excuse me"?

00:23:08.303 --> 00:23:10.806
You kept saying, "Excuse me!"
and scolding Sang-hak.

00:23:13.141 --> 00:23:13.975
I did?

00:23:14.059 --> 00:23:17.479
Sang-hak's probably feeling super dejected
right about now.

00:23:19.523 --> 00:23:21.983
I can't remember a thing. Could you…

00:23:23.985 --> 00:23:27.072
Excuse me!

00:23:27.656 --> 00:23:29.449
Never ever!

00:23:29.533 --> 00:23:30.575
…look like a fool?

00:23:30.659 --> 00:23:33.412
That guy? I'd never date him!

00:23:33.495 --> 00:23:34.996
Never ever!

00:23:39.251 --> 00:23:40.460
Oh my God.

00:23:43.755 --> 00:23:44.881
What have I done?

00:23:45.382 --> 00:23:47.926
Everyone I meet keeps saying, "Excuse me!"

00:23:48.009 --> 00:23:50.303
You would have done the same.

00:23:50.971 --> 00:23:53.515
When you first said, "Excuse me,"
everyone went silent.

00:23:53.598 --> 00:23:55.016
Then we all burst out laughing.

00:23:56.143 --> 00:23:58.895
You're such a hoot when you're drunk!

00:24:00.063 --> 00:24:04.526
I remember saying, "Excuse me,"
but I don't remember why.

00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:07.529
Why I said that to Sang-hak
in the first place.

00:24:08.029 --> 00:24:08.989
Said what?

00:24:10.866 --> 00:24:12.159
That I wouldn't date him.

00:24:14.536 --> 00:24:16.246
That's because I was on a roll.

00:24:17.372 --> 00:24:18.206
On a roll?

00:24:18.290 --> 00:24:21.084
The treasurer and head of planning.

00:24:25.005 --> 00:24:27.299
Hyeon-jin and beanie guy!

00:24:27.382 --> 00:24:29.468
-Damn, how did you know?
-She's spot on.

00:24:29.551 --> 00:24:31.928
Polka dot and that guy!

00:24:32.012 --> 00:24:33.013
Yeah, we're dating!

00:24:34.598 --> 00:24:37.851
Everyone was in awe that night
because I sniffed out every couple.

00:24:37.934 --> 00:24:39.519
And lastly,

00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:42.606
let me make a prediction.

00:24:42.689 --> 00:24:44.399
Kim Sang-hak

00:24:44.483 --> 00:24:45.817
and Eun-jung!

00:24:46.651 --> 00:24:48.570
They'll be dating within a month!

00:24:54.868 --> 00:24:58.246
Come on. Sang-hak just wanted her
to join the research team.

00:24:58.330 --> 00:24:59.539
Want to bet 10,000 won?

00:25:00.123 --> 00:25:03.210
Whether Eun-jung and Sang-hak
will be dating within a month?

00:25:03.293 --> 00:25:04.377
Be honest with me, bro.

00:25:04.878 --> 00:25:09.508
Do you think you'll date Tri-X or not?

00:25:20.810 --> 00:25:22.646
Excuse me!

00:25:22.729 --> 00:25:23.688
And excuse you!

00:25:23.772 --> 00:25:26.733
Why are you all making me

00:25:26.816 --> 00:25:29.277
look like a fool?

00:25:29.361 --> 00:25:31.488
I'm telling you now.

00:25:32.197 --> 00:25:33.073
That guy?

00:25:33.156 --> 00:25:36.701
I'd never ever date that guy!

00:25:38.662 --> 00:25:41.039
I'm never dating him!

00:25:43.708 --> 00:25:46.086
Why would I say that?

00:25:47.128 --> 00:25:48.630
Oh, poor you.

00:25:56.429 --> 00:26:00.850
SEOUL CAMERA SUPPLY
CAMERAS AND FILM PHOTOGRAPHY

00:26:04.396 --> 00:26:05.480
Hello.

00:26:09.609 --> 00:26:10.735
Looking for something?

00:26:13.697 --> 00:26:15.365
I wanted to buy some film…

00:26:18.702 --> 00:26:22.455
Could I please get three,
no, four rolls of Tri-X

00:26:22.539 --> 00:26:25.458
and a 52 mm UV filter?

00:26:40.599 --> 00:26:41.474
Need a bag?

00:26:42.267 --> 00:26:43.852
No. I can carry it all in this.

00:26:46.563 --> 00:26:49.649
It's 2,200 won for each roll
and 12,300 won for the UV filter,

00:26:49.733 --> 00:26:51.359
so your total is 21,100 won.

00:27:05.874 --> 00:27:07.208
I see we have a customer.

00:27:09.502 --> 00:27:10.629
One second.

00:27:13.548 --> 00:27:15.008
Here. 8,900 won change.

00:27:16.217 --> 00:27:17.510
Thank you.

00:27:19.137 --> 00:27:20.138
Bye.

00:27:20.889 --> 00:27:21.765
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

00:27:22.807 --> 00:27:24.643
-Do you know her?
-She's just a freshman.

00:27:35.862 --> 00:27:37.155
"Just a freshman."

00:27:38.698 --> 00:27:39.783
That meant

00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:43.536
that I no longer meant anything to him.

00:27:44.746 --> 00:27:46.331
That I was a nobody.

00:28:21.282 --> 00:28:23.159
Despite my efforts to stop…

00:28:25.036 --> 00:28:26.955
my eyes kept drifting to him.

00:28:47.350 --> 00:28:49.102
Everything about him…

00:28:52.564 --> 00:28:54.190
seemed to hold so much meaning.

00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:16.671
-Eun-jung, I must ask.
-Yes?

00:29:16.755 --> 00:29:18.131
Are you dating Sang-hak?

00:29:20.049 --> 00:29:20.884
No.

00:29:20.967 --> 00:29:25.054
Nice! Kim A-ra, give me 10,000 won.
It's been a month, and they're not dating.

00:29:28.391 --> 00:29:29.225
Pay up.

00:29:34.230 --> 00:29:36.065
-Give me the money.
-Seriously?

00:29:36.649 --> 00:29:38.401
Jeez, read the room.

00:30:06.846 --> 00:30:08.181
Yes, Su-mi.

00:30:10.892 --> 00:30:13.269
I don't think I'll be able to make it.

00:30:14.062 --> 00:30:16.314
Something's come up at home.

00:30:16.981 --> 00:30:18.399
I'll join you next time.

00:30:21.569 --> 00:30:24.447
I won't miss the next one. All right, bye.

00:30:26.699 --> 00:30:30.537
Why use family matters as an excuse?
You even bought sneakers for the trip.

00:30:30.620 --> 00:30:33.122
We have 40 kilograms' worth
of injeolmi orders.

00:30:33.832 --> 00:30:36.209
Having Eun-jung help out
makes things easier.

00:30:36.292 --> 00:30:38.670
Eun-jung's faster
at making these than you.

00:30:42.257 --> 00:30:43.925
-Is my order ready?
-Yes, hey.

00:30:44.008 --> 00:30:45.718
-Hello.
-Hello.

00:30:45.802 --> 00:30:47.512
Eun-jung, you're here too.

00:30:49.055 --> 00:30:51.724
You're even prettier
now that you're in university.

00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:55.103
Eun-jung, do you like being in university?

00:30:55.186 --> 00:30:58.648
It's better than being in high school.
No more late night classes.

00:30:59.941 --> 00:31:03.278
You're so lucky.
It must be so nice to be 20!

00:31:04.904 --> 00:31:08.032
It's such a wonderful age.
You're like a flower blooming.

00:31:12.954 --> 00:31:14.205
I could have cried.

00:31:17.458 --> 00:31:19.544
Because this isn't how I'd imagined

00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:21.838
being 20 would be.

00:31:25.133 --> 00:31:26.968
I imagined it to be

00:31:28.219 --> 00:31:29.512
more exhilarating.

00:31:31.139 --> 00:31:33.057
Super exciting.

00:31:38.354 --> 00:31:39.814
Just as she had said…

00:31:41.733 --> 00:31:43.192
blooming like a flower.

00:31:51.618 --> 00:31:54.537
Sang-hak's not coming to Pohang either
because of you.

00:31:59.167 --> 00:32:00.001
Why?

00:32:00.501 --> 00:32:04.088
How would I know?
Why can't you guys just get over it?

00:32:04.172 --> 00:32:07.175
If you're not dating, you're not.
Why miss the photography trip?

00:32:22.106 --> 00:32:24.609
-Hello.
-Here to work on your photos?

00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:27.528
Go on. No one's inside.

00:32:29.197 --> 00:32:30.323
Sang-hak seonbae.

00:32:36.204 --> 00:32:39.290
Are you really not going
on the photography trip because of me?

00:32:39.916 --> 00:32:41.793
Because I'll find it uncomfortable?

00:32:45.129 --> 00:32:49.092
If we'd both feel awkward…
it's only right that I don't go.

00:32:51.886 --> 00:32:53.596
How would that be right?

00:32:54.389 --> 00:32:57.517
I've already been there twice.
And I'm older than you.

00:32:59.686 --> 00:33:00.770
But still…

00:33:00.853 --> 00:33:01.896
If I'd known…

00:33:03.690 --> 00:33:07.443
that I made you so uncomfortable,
I wouldn't have acted that way.

00:33:09.821 --> 00:33:11.781
I've been meaning to tell you this.

00:33:12.949 --> 00:33:14.575
I'm sorry for overstepping.

00:33:15.326 --> 00:33:17.829
That won't happen again,

00:33:18.329 --> 00:33:19.914
so just enjoy being in the club.

00:33:20.915 --> 00:33:23.167
It would be a shame
to give up something you enjoy

00:33:24.460 --> 00:33:25.628
over someone you dislike.

00:33:28.256 --> 00:33:30.633
I don't dislike you.

00:33:31.592 --> 00:33:34.429
You didn't do anything
for me to dislike you.

00:33:37.724 --> 00:33:41.519
It's my fault, really.
I'm the one who feels uncomfortable.

00:33:50.111 --> 00:33:51.571
All right, then. Let's hear it.

00:33:52.655 --> 00:33:54.407
Why do I make you so uncomfortable?

00:33:57.493 --> 00:33:58.786
It's just…

00:33:58.870 --> 00:34:02.123
You said you disliked me
from the very start.

00:34:03.416 --> 00:34:04.250
I said that?

00:34:04.834 --> 00:34:05.668
Yes.

00:34:09.464 --> 00:34:10.798
So tell me,

00:34:11.799 --> 00:34:14.427
why do you hate Sang-hak so much?

00:34:15.303 --> 00:34:18.347
Because he's Sang-hak.

00:34:18.431 --> 00:34:21.059
Yeah, he's Sang-hak.

00:34:21.559 --> 00:34:24.604
It may not seem like it, but he is
the most popular guy in our club.

00:34:25.104 --> 00:34:26.397
Do you really not like him?

00:34:28.232 --> 00:34:32.070
From the very first moment I saw him,

00:34:33.112 --> 00:34:34.697
he's been Sang-hak.

00:34:36.365 --> 00:34:38.326
Makes me so uncomfortable…

00:34:42.914 --> 00:34:43.998
That…

00:34:46.042 --> 00:34:47.627
was about your name.

00:34:48.503 --> 00:34:52.757
That was about how you have the same name
as someone I used to know.

00:34:54.425 --> 00:34:55.259
The same name?

00:35:01.307 --> 00:35:02.433
Hold up.

00:35:05.978 --> 00:35:08.356
How much of a jerk was he for you to…

00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:11.526
What kind of person is he?
That Kim Sang-hak.

00:35:14.862 --> 00:35:16.239
Just Sang-hak.

00:35:17.865 --> 00:35:19.492
Not Kim Sang-hak.

00:35:23.579 --> 00:35:25.915
Just Sang-hak oppa.

00:35:29.252 --> 00:35:30.878
I had a crush on him,

00:35:31.879 --> 00:35:34.507
and seeing you reminds me of him.

00:35:39.303 --> 00:35:40.596
1/60th of a second.

00:35:42.265 --> 00:35:45.268
It's him, isn't it? The one you mentioned
on your registration form.

00:35:51.607 --> 00:35:52.859
Collecting time.

00:35:53.609 --> 00:35:57.029
Did you bring up the dragonfly net
because you read that?

00:35:57.113 --> 00:35:58.281
Of course.

00:36:01.033 --> 00:36:03.786
I didn't know that and thought…

00:36:05.121 --> 00:36:09.458
I was shocked you had the same name,
but you kept saying the same things.

00:36:09.542 --> 00:36:12.128
He's actually the reason
I joined the club, but--

00:36:12.211 --> 00:36:14.338
So I don't share a name with someone

00:36:14.922 --> 00:36:16.299
who was a jerk to you, right?

00:36:17.592 --> 00:36:18.634
I share it

00:36:19.427 --> 00:36:21.012
with someone you like?

00:36:27.101 --> 00:36:29.061
Then why do I make you so uncomfortable?

00:36:33.649 --> 00:36:35.151
Because you're so nice to me.

00:36:36.777 --> 00:36:38.946
You were nice to me for no reason.

00:36:39.530 --> 00:36:41.949
-Seriously?
-And asked me to join the research team.

00:36:42.450 --> 00:36:45.286
It's strange because I haven't done
anything to deserve it.

00:36:45.369 --> 00:36:47.580
Why wouldn't you deserve it?

00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:51.334
On the first day we met,
you made me laugh and run around campus.

00:36:53.169 --> 00:36:56.380
And it's not like I was the only one
who wanted you on my team.

00:36:56.964 --> 00:37:00.092
Jeong-seon wanted you to join planning,
and the others, they…

00:37:01.177 --> 00:37:03.596
Man, I'm really telling you everything.

00:37:04.931 --> 00:37:09.310
I played so much rock, paper, scissors
to bring you to the research team…

00:37:12.605 --> 00:37:13.731
Anyways…

00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:28.746
Come tomorrow. That place is great.

00:37:35.753 --> 00:37:36.837
Is that a promise?

00:37:38.881 --> 00:37:39.840
Okay.

00:37:39.924 --> 00:37:43.135
If you come early,
I'll buy you a popsicle.

00:37:46.222 --> 00:37:47.223
A popsicle?

00:37:47.306 --> 00:37:49.058
Yes. A popsicle.

00:37:59.944 --> 00:38:02.905
SANGBONG TERMINAL

00:38:04.490 --> 00:38:05.825
A popsicle, huh?

00:38:09.412 --> 00:38:10.329
A popsicle?

00:38:25.011 --> 00:38:25.845
Eun-jung.

00:38:27.263 --> 00:38:28.306
Hello.

00:38:28.389 --> 00:38:31.058
You're here so early.
You do know it's the 6:50 bus, right?

00:38:31.642 --> 00:38:32.476
Yes.

00:38:33.227 --> 00:38:34.145
That reminds me.

00:38:35.646 --> 00:38:37.606
-I'll pay you the club fee.
-Sure.

00:38:45.531 --> 00:38:46.532
Chips, anyone?

00:38:47.074 --> 00:38:48.367
Hi, guys!

00:38:48.451 --> 00:38:51.287
-Hello.
-Stay seated, guys.

00:38:52.496 --> 00:38:54.957
I need to pee. Don't you need to go?

00:38:55.041 --> 00:38:56.125
Yeah, I'll go.

00:39:05.176 --> 00:39:07.178
Everyone, the bus is here.

00:39:07.261 --> 00:39:09.638
Please board by 6:45.

00:39:09.722 --> 00:39:10.681
Okay.

00:39:13.642 --> 00:39:16.395
You take the window seat.
I always pass out on buses.

00:39:16.479 --> 00:39:18.814
-Sure. Why don't you get on first?
-Okay.

00:39:18.898 --> 00:39:21.317
KIM SANG-HAK SEONBAE

00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:24.236
Lee Ki-yeong, please come
to the lost and found center

00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:25.237
on the second floor…

00:39:25.988 --> 00:39:27.156
Stop it.

00:39:27.239 --> 00:39:29.158
-I'm feeling sick.
-Can you get on the bus?

00:39:29.241 --> 00:39:30.201
No.

00:39:33.079 --> 00:39:34.872
Sang-hak said he'd come too.

00:39:34.955 --> 00:39:36.248
He did, didn't he?

00:39:36.332 --> 00:39:37.917
-Sang-hak's coming?
-Yes.

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:40.002
-I thought he couldn't?
-He said he would.

00:39:40.086 --> 00:39:42.296
Get on the bus. I'll try calling him.

00:39:43.130 --> 00:39:43.964
Let's go.

00:39:58.437 --> 00:39:59.688
Hold on.

00:39:59.772 --> 00:40:01.899
Didn't our head of research say
he'd come too?

00:40:02.483 --> 00:40:05.194
He's not picking up,
so I guess he's sleeping in.

00:40:05.694 --> 00:40:07.947
Don't worry about him.
He'll find his way there.

00:40:08.447 --> 00:40:10.783
He's never been late for anything.

00:40:20.918 --> 00:40:23.963
Hey. Is everything okay?

00:40:35.099 --> 00:40:37.476
Everything was most definitely not okay.

00:40:38.561 --> 00:40:41.021
Otherwise, he would be here.

00:40:42.898 --> 00:40:46.152
For no reason,
my mind turned to Cheon Sang-hak…

00:40:48.154 --> 00:40:49.530
and that smile of his.

00:40:53.659 --> 00:40:55.453
That had been the last of him.

00:41:14.597 --> 00:41:17.808
MUNGYEONG REST STOP

00:41:20.603 --> 00:41:23.147
Sang-hak seonbae is just sleeping in.

00:41:24.732 --> 00:41:26.734
He's not Sang-hak oppa.

00:41:28.277 --> 00:41:30.321
He's asleep. That's all.

00:41:34.116 --> 00:41:35.868
The view's gorgeous!

00:41:43.876 --> 00:41:45.586
Dang, you scared me. Where were you?

00:41:45.669 --> 00:41:46.962
Hey, Kim Sang-hak!

00:41:47.922 --> 00:41:51.217
We thought you were still asleep at home.
How did you get here before us?

00:41:51.300 --> 00:41:52.343
I flew here, okay?

00:41:52.426 --> 00:41:54.220
And how exactly did you fly here?

00:41:55.179 --> 00:41:57.056
How do you think? By plane, of course.

00:41:57.139 --> 00:41:59.266
You rode a plane here?

00:42:00.476 --> 00:42:02.394
Don't eat all the popsicles
in the freezer!

00:42:02.478 --> 00:42:05.147
-Popsicles? There are popsicles!
-Where are they?

00:42:05.231 --> 00:42:07.233
Guys, get inside. There are popsicles!

00:42:07.316 --> 00:42:09.777
-Come inside.
-Where are they?

00:42:15.783 --> 00:42:16.992
Ryu Eun-jung!

00:42:18.244 --> 00:42:19.912
Eun-jung, take me with you!

00:42:23.290 --> 00:42:24.124
Eun-jung.

00:42:30.297 --> 00:42:31.423
Are you crying?

00:42:33.259 --> 00:42:34.134
No.

00:42:34.635 --> 00:42:36.512
Hey, come on. Were you worried?

00:42:37.012 --> 00:42:39.974
That's why I took a plane here.

00:42:41.058 --> 00:42:42.977
Do you know how much it cost me?

00:42:44.603 --> 00:42:47.439
Honestly, I flew here
because I didn't want you to worry.

00:42:47.940 --> 00:42:49.567
You'll laugh if I tell you.

00:42:49.650 --> 00:42:51.944
I swear I left early this morning,

00:42:52.027 --> 00:42:56.073
but my phone fell between the platforms
when I was transferring--

00:42:56.156 --> 00:42:57.700
I thought you'd died.

00:43:01.245 --> 00:43:02.079
Died?

00:43:04.456 --> 00:43:05.791
Hey, come on, now…

00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:26.895
I don't know why I cried so hard.

00:43:28.272 --> 00:43:30.691
I thought it strange
even as the tears fell.

00:43:33.319 --> 00:43:37.573
I had never cried so hard,
not even when Sang-hak died.

00:43:45.581 --> 00:43:49.335
Sang-hak seonbae later told me
that seeing me cry explained a lot.

00:43:52.046 --> 00:43:56.717
Including why I acted so strange
after hearing his name…

00:43:59.094 --> 00:44:02.973
who owned the film roll I brought,
and what had happened to them.

00:44:32.044 --> 00:44:33.379
Will you be my girlfriend?

00:44:38.258 --> 00:44:40.511
I like you.

00:44:49.436 --> 00:44:50.521
I like you too.

00:45:03.409 --> 00:45:04.368
Guys!

00:45:04.910 --> 00:45:06.370
What are you doing over there?

00:45:08.789 --> 00:45:09.873
Hyeon-guk.

00:45:11.166 --> 00:45:12.251
Give A-ra 10,000 won.

00:45:12.334 --> 00:45:13.502
-What?
-Why?

00:45:14.586 --> 00:45:15.713
We're dating!

00:45:26.306 --> 00:45:27.516
Let's go eat popsicles.

00:45:30.728 --> 00:45:33.313
Oh my God, they're actually dating!

00:45:33.397 --> 00:45:35.107
Ryu Eun-jung!

00:45:41.613 --> 00:45:43.407
I didn't even know you had taken these.

00:45:44.241 --> 00:45:46.910
-Not one photo, but three.
-It's actually five.

00:45:47.619 --> 00:45:49.079
-Five?
-Yeah.

00:45:49.163 --> 00:45:49.997
SPRING OF 2002

00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:52.249
Here. Look.

00:45:55.544 --> 00:45:57.421
You made this contact print?

00:45:58.046 --> 00:45:59.715
It's so pretty.

00:46:00.466 --> 00:46:02.760
Are you calling yourself pretty?

00:46:04.511 --> 00:46:05.429
Yeah.

00:46:08.307 --> 00:46:10.434
So you liked me since then.

00:46:11.018 --> 00:46:12.352
Why didn't you say so?

00:46:13.353 --> 00:46:17.608
Back then, I just couldn't read your mind.

00:46:17.691 --> 00:46:19.443
You had this mysterious charm.

00:46:20.527 --> 00:46:21.528
Now you're…

00:46:22.237 --> 00:46:23.572
An open book, aren't I?

00:46:25.908 --> 00:46:27.618
I tell all before you get curious.

00:46:28.994 --> 00:46:30.329
You know yourself well.

00:46:32.748 --> 00:46:36.168
It seems like you've done
so many exhibitions.

00:46:36.251 --> 00:46:38.337
I did start photography in middle school.

00:46:39.296 --> 00:46:40.172
I'll go.

00:46:41.882 --> 00:46:42.841
Welcome.

00:46:55.145 --> 00:46:57.523
Thank you, ma'am. Have a good day!

00:46:59.983 --> 00:47:00.818
What's that?

00:47:02.110 --> 00:47:04.071
What exhibition was this?

00:47:04.154 --> 00:47:07.574
It was with a club I was in
during my gap year.

00:47:07.658 --> 00:47:08.492
Why?

00:47:09.493 --> 00:47:11.036
Oh, it's nothing.

00:47:12.162 --> 00:47:14.498
I thought it might be someone I know,

00:47:15.749 --> 00:47:17.000
but I don't think it is.

00:47:17.709 --> 00:47:20.045
Yeah, it's definitely not.

00:47:22.422 --> 00:47:23.674
My uncle's here.

00:47:25.717 --> 00:47:27.678
-I see Sang-hak's here.
-Hello, sir.

00:47:29.596 --> 00:47:30.430
-You good?
-Yes.

00:47:31.014 --> 00:47:32.474
How was the turnout?

00:47:33.267 --> 00:47:35.352
A handful of freshmen took our leaflets,

00:47:35.435 --> 00:47:38.856
but I only saw one person
fill out a registration form.

00:47:40.899 --> 00:47:42.651
I see why freshmen are so rare.

00:47:43.235 --> 00:47:45.362
That reminds me
of something funny from earlier.

00:47:45.445 --> 00:47:47.364
-The one who filled out a form.
-Yeah?

00:47:47.447 --> 00:47:51.243
They just showed up to our booth and asked
if broke people can take up photography.

00:47:51.326 --> 00:47:52.911
MAGIC HOUR
29TH RECRUITMENT

00:47:53.996 --> 00:47:54.830
Can I

00:47:56.290 --> 00:47:59.418
learn photography even if I'm broke?

00:48:02.129 --> 00:48:02.963
You can.

00:48:03.463 --> 00:48:06.633
But you'd need a camera,
even if it's not an expensive one.

00:48:07.134 --> 00:48:08.135
Do you have one?

00:48:09.678 --> 00:48:12.931
That person then took a camera
out of a bag and showed it to me.

00:48:13.015 --> 00:48:13.974
Guess what it was.

00:48:17.519 --> 00:48:19.146
A Leica M3.

00:48:20.981 --> 00:48:22.149
A Leica?

00:48:23.525 --> 00:48:26.403
M3… Isn't that the model you want?

00:48:26.486 --> 00:48:28.864
Yeah. It's the camera of my dreams.

00:48:28.947 --> 00:48:30.657
Broke but has a Leica?

00:48:30.741 --> 00:48:31.950
That's hilarious.

00:48:32.034 --> 00:48:34.161
Right? The reason for joining
is even funnier.

00:48:35.412 --> 00:48:37.623
We all cracked up after reading the form.

00:48:43.003 --> 00:48:44.129
What is this?

00:48:45.964 --> 00:48:48.050
"Can't say…"

00:48:48.133 --> 00:48:50.802
-Huh?
-What the…

00:48:50.886 --> 00:48:53.096
-What is…
-Is this really…

00:48:53.180 --> 00:48:54.181
What is this?

00:48:57.851 --> 00:49:02.731
REASON FOR JOINING:
CAN'T SAY

00:49:04.399 --> 00:49:06.777
That's what was written? "Can't say"?

00:49:06.860 --> 00:49:08.070
Yeah. Funny, isn't it?

00:49:08.153 --> 00:49:09.738
How funny.

00:49:10.656 --> 00:49:12.407
When is your mother being discharged?

00:49:12.491 --> 00:49:13.659
The day after tomorrow.

00:49:13.742 --> 00:49:16.912
That's good. So you can make it
to the newbie welcome party, right?

00:49:16.995 --> 00:49:17.829
I guess so.

00:49:21.833 --> 00:49:24.628
Hello. I broke up with my girlfriend
three months ago.

00:49:24.711 --> 00:49:25.963
-Oh dear!
-Poor you.

00:49:26.672 --> 00:49:29.549
I'm Kim Dae-kyu, a social science student.
Class of 2002.

00:49:29.633 --> 00:49:33.679
I dream of walking this university campus
with a newfound love!

00:49:34.554 --> 00:49:35.889
Blue jumper across from you.

00:49:48.360 --> 00:49:52.572
Hello. I'm Cheon Sang-yeon.
Class of 2002. School of Engineering.

00:49:57.869 --> 00:50:01.915
I should technically be a grade higher.
I didn't intend to take a gap year…

00:50:05.794 --> 00:50:07.212
It was Sang-yeon.

00:50:08.088 --> 00:50:10.340
I didn't really go to school.

00:50:10.424 --> 00:50:12.259
I much preferred going out.

00:50:14.302 --> 00:50:18.265
The "yeon" in my name means swallow,
so I'm quite the carefree bird.

00:50:20.642 --> 00:50:24.896
I've never taken photos before,
but I figured it could be fun.

00:50:24.980 --> 00:50:26.648
Do you have an older sister?

00:50:27.607 --> 00:50:29.568
No, I don't have an older sister,

00:50:30.235 --> 00:50:32.571
but I do have
a good-for-nothing older brother.

00:50:34.281 --> 00:50:35.574
Thanks for the warm welcome!

00:54:43.571 --> 00:54:48.576
