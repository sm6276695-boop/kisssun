Seok Su.

00:00:42.435 --> 00:00:43.369
Seok Su.

00:00:44.304 --> 00:00:45.405
- Are you okay?
- Seok Su.

00:00:46.272 --> 00:00:47.273
Seok Su.

00:00:47.273 --> 00:00:49.309
How did you know to come here?

00:00:55.215 --> 00:00:57.183
- Don't be like that.
- Say something.

00:00:58.885 --> 00:00:59.919
Seok Su.

00:00:59.919 --> 00:01:01.020
What do we do? Seok Su.

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.821
Seok Su.

00:01:02.255 --> 00:01:03.456
- Seok Su.
- Why is Seok Su...

00:01:03.456 --> 00:01:05.291
What do we do?

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:12.098
What should we do with the kids?

00:01:12.665 --> 00:01:13.700
Wait.

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:14.801
We'll kill them all at once.

00:01:35.521 --> 00:01:36.956
Seok Su.

00:01:38.524 --> 00:01:39.893
Seok Su.

00:01:41.528 --> 00:01:42.462
Let me go.

Ah Hyun.

00:01:44.898 --> 00:01:46.032
I'm not going, Uncle.

00:01:46.566 --> 00:01:48.535
If you do this, you'll die.

00:01:49.335 --> 00:01:50.737
If Mom no longer needs me,

00:01:51.638 --> 00:01:53.306
then I'll die anyway. Isn't that right?

00:01:54.107 --> 00:01:55.708
Before Mom abandons me,

00:01:56.175 --> 00:01:57.710
I'm going to abandon her first.

00:01:59.812 --> 00:02:00.880
Uncle, you should stop this too.

00:02:02.382 --> 00:02:03.383
Mom...

00:02:04.284 --> 00:02:05.485
is not a mother.

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.887
Let's go back.

00:02:10.623 --> 00:02:11.491
I'm not going.

00:02:14.194 --> 00:02:15.228
If you go in there,

00:02:17.397 --> 00:02:18.498
you'll regret it.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.436
I might kill you.

00:02:24.137 --> 00:02:25.305
Then do it now.

Seok Su.

00:02:37.951 --> 00:02:39.319
Why aren't you saying anything?

00:02:39.986 --> 00:02:40.954
Ah Hyun.

00:02:42.488 --> 00:02:43.823
Seok Su.

00:02:43.823 --> 00:02:46.192
What's wrong with him?

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:49.262
Seok Su, look at me.

00:02:49.662 --> 00:02:51.598
- What do we do?
- Ah Hyun.

00:02:51.598 --> 00:02:52.599
Seok Su.

00:02:53.233 --> 00:02:54.467
I'm okay.

00:02:54.467 --> 00:02:56.736
Don't talk!

00:02:56.736 --> 00:03:00.039
Seok Su, don't say anything.
You're not going to die.

00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:01.074
Even so,

00:03:02.342 --> 00:03:03.309
it's okay.

00:03:05.044 --> 00:03:06.613
We're all together in the end.

00:03:08.314 --> 00:03:10.950
Seok Su, don't die.

00:03:11.451 --> 00:03:13.319
- Wake up, Seok Su.
- I like it.

00:03:14.587 --> 00:03:15.588
Seok Su.

00:03:15.588 --> 00:03:16.956
My real name.

00:03:16.956 --> 00:03:18.391
Seok Su.

00:03:18.391 --> 00:03:20.527

00:03:29.402 --> 00:03:31.504
Seok Su, no.

00:03:33.373 --> 00:03:35.174
Wake up.

Seok Su.

00:03:41.681 --> 00:03:43.416
Wake up, Seok Su.

Seok Su.

00:03:50.023 --> 00:03:52.725
I'm sorry.

00:03:53.593 --> 00:03:56.029
I'm sorry, Seok Su.

00:04:05.972 --> 00:04:06.873
Ah Hyun.

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.376
Why are you doing this to us?

00:04:13.746 --> 00:04:15.648
What do we do now?

I don't want to die.

00:06:17.837 --> 00:06:19.906
Please save me, mister.

00:06:19.906 --> 00:06:22.242
I don't want to die.

Breaking news just in.

and identified some suspects...

00:06:34.487 --> 00:06:38.391
in the murder case of the pastor couple
from the church in Buchon-dong.

00:06:38.391 --> 00:06:40.793
Among them is Mr. Yoon,
the son of the pastor couple.

00:06:40.793 --> 00:06:42.161
They are three in total.

He's being strange, Tae Sik.

00:06:52.605 --> 00:06:54.707
Seok Su.

00:06:56.576 --> 00:06:58.177
Someone call an ambulance.

00:06:59.579 --> 00:07:00.780
He's not breathing.

00:07:02.615 --> 00:07:03.616
What do we do?

00:07:04.183 --> 00:07:06.786
What do we do? Please call an ambulance.

00:07:08.421 --> 00:07:09.455
Let's go.

00:07:09.455 --> 00:07:10.723
Hurry. So Mi, guide the kids.

00:07:10.723 --> 00:07:12.392
Ju An, get a hold of yourself. Hurry.

00:07:34.013 --> 00:07:34.847
You.

00:07:35.582 --> 00:07:37.050
Did you lose them, or let them go?

00:07:37.517 --> 00:07:39.452
I was especially fond of her.

00:07:39.452 --> 00:07:41.154
She was the most useful among them.

00:07:41.154 --> 00:07:42.655
But you shouldn't have.

00:07:43.289 --> 00:07:45.291
Did I bring you here
to play uncle to them?

00:07:48.328 --> 00:07:49.963
(Madam)

Jung Hyun.

00:07:57.070 --> 00:07:57.937
Yes.

00:08:05.278 --> 00:08:06.779
Next time,

00:08:07.714 --> 00:08:08.982
you must kill Ah Hyun.

00:08:10.149 --> 00:08:12.051
Cleaning up the useless ones.

00:08:12.986 --> 00:08:15.421
That's your job, right?

00:08:16.322 --> 00:08:17.323
Do you understand?

00:08:22.161 --> 00:08:24.631
Seok Su, wake up.

00:08:25.265 --> 00:08:27.333
Seok Su, why are you lying down like this?

00:08:27.634 --> 00:08:28.868
Wake up, Seok Su.

00:08:30.570 --> 00:08:33.306
We said we'd live happily together.

00:08:33.306 --> 00:08:36.309
Why do you have to die?

00:08:36.309 --> 00:08:37.477
Don't die.

00:08:38.678 --> 00:08:39.679
What do we do?

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:41.247
Tae Sik.

00:08:41.915 --> 00:08:43.616
Tae Sik, this isn't right.

00:08:44.717 --> 00:08:45.618
Ah Hyun.

00:08:46.052 --> 00:08:49.522
Ah Hyun, this isn't right.

00:08:49.522 --> 00:08:50.890
What do we do now?

00:08:50.890 --> 00:08:53.326
What do we do? Seok Su.

00:08:57.564 --> 00:08:59.365
We said we'd live happily together.

00:09:00.934 --> 00:09:04.003
Why break the promise we made?

00:09:04.504 --> 00:09:07.240
Seok Su, you can't die like this.

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:08.474
Seok Su.

00:09:08.474 --> 00:09:11.077
Seok Su, please don't die.

00:09:11.778 --> 00:09:14.614
- Seok Su, please.
- Open your eyes.

00:09:14.614 --> 00:09:15.982
- Seok Su.
- Seok Su.

00:09:19.652 --> 00:09:21.120
Seok Su, wake up.

00:09:22.889 --> 00:09:24.357
- No.
- Seok Su.

00:09:46.412 --> 00:09:47.480
I'm sorry.

00:09:49.382 --> 00:09:50.650
I was too late.

00:09:53.653 --> 00:09:54.687
It's my fault.

00:09:55.822 --> 00:09:57.490
I couldn't protect him.

00:10:00.226 --> 00:10:01.494
I said I'd let him live...

00:10:03.863 --> 00:10:06.866
a normal and free life.

00:10:09.969 --> 00:10:10.837
But now,

00:10:13.339 --> 00:10:15.441
Seok Su is gone.

00:10:20.346 --> 00:10:21.948
What do we do, Tae Sik?

00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:26.019
What now?

Assemblyman Kwon Kang Man of
the New Gyeore Party has been found dead.

00:10:42.468 --> 00:10:44.671
A total of five bodies,
including that of Assemblyman Kwon,

00:10:44.671 --> 00:10:47.307
were found at the scene.

00:10:47.707 --> 00:10:51.811
The suspects are the children involved
in the murder of Pastor Yoon and his wifeâ€¦

00:10:56.616 --> 00:10:57.584
Actually,

00:10:59.118 --> 00:11:00.920
I heard something a bit troubling.

00:11:02.021 --> 00:11:02.956
What is it?

00:11:04.090 --> 00:11:06.326
Rumors are spreading
in the National Assembly.

00:11:08.895 --> 00:11:10.230
That Assemblyman Kwon Kang Man was...

00:11:12.432 --> 00:11:14.567
a member
of the adoption-for-sale membership.

00:11:17.537 --> 00:11:19.939
Seeing how poorly the secrecy was kept,

00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:22.609
I'm starting to get nervous too.

00:11:23.643 --> 00:11:26.546
I hate when people gossip
about private matters.

00:11:28.314 --> 00:11:29.749
Maybe I'm too sensitive.

00:11:32.318 --> 00:11:34.287
With the pastor couple dead,

00:11:36.155 --> 00:11:38.191
and even Kwon Kang Man ending up
like that...

00:11:38.825 --> 00:11:39.759
Madam.

00:11:41.628 --> 00:11:43.263
If you think about it,

00:11:44.264 --> 00:11:45.832
this may actually be a good thing.

00:11:57.577 --> 00:12:00.079
No one left in this world knows...

00:12:01.047 --> 00:12:02.782
about our meeting anymore.

00:12:05.184 --> 00:12:06.119
Sister.

00:12:08.054 --> 00:12:08.922
I know well...

00:12:09.889 --> 00:12:13.560
that you can't open the future
without closing the past.

00:12:14.661 --> 00:12:17.197
What do you mean?

00:12:18.198 --> 00:12:20.967
Back when there were no laws
or proper technology,

00:12:20.967 --> 00:12:22.902
mistakes were inevitable.

00:12:23.236 --> 00:12:25.538
So yes, there were noisy incidents.

00:12:25.538 --> 00:12:29.442
But now we have laws,
and perfect technology.

00:12:29.442 --> 00:12:30.877
There are no more errors.

00:12:31.377 --> 00:12:32.979
All we have to do is...

00:12:32.979 --> 00:12:35.448
filter out the errors of the past.

00:12:35.748 --> 00:12:38.218
Cleanly, without a trace.

00:12:39.986 --> 00:12:41.721
You'll be held accountable
for those words.

00:12:42.555 --> 00:12:43.456
You know that, right?

00:12:48.394 --> 00:12:50.129
There won't be any trace left.

00:12:50.997 --> 00:12:52.031
None at all.

00:13:09.315 --> 00:13:11.084
When will it be perfect?

00:13:12.886 --> 00:13:13.820
Soon.

00:13:16.222 --> 00:13:17.223
It'll be done soon.

00:13:20.793 --> 00:13:22.095
Let's stop now.

00:13:23.897 --> 00:13:26.232
I won't let you do
anything dangerous anymore.

00:13:27.534 --> 00:13:29.202
I can't lose anyone else.

00:13:31.671 --> 00:13:32.705
I can't go.

00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:34.807
What?

00:13:35.842 --> 00:13:37.477
She's the woman who tried to kill us.

00:13:38.778 --> 00:13:40.480
And now Seok Su is dead too.

00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:41.981
What's next?

00:13:42.749 --> 00:13:44.384
More children will be sacrificed.

00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:49.222
I can't allow this anymore.

00:13:49.222 --> 00:13:50.123
Ah Hyun.

00:13:50.623 --> 00:13:52.258
I promised the kids...

00:13:52.258 --> 00:13:54.160
that I'd let them go anywhere they want...

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:55.528
and live freely.

00:13:59.199 --> 00:14:00.567
I couldn't keep that promise to Seok Su,

00:14:01.768 --> 00:14:03.636
but I want the remaining kids
to live like that no matter what.

00:14:05.405 --> 00:14:06.906
I can't let it end like this.

00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:21.621
You're still alive.

00:14:23.523 --> 00:14:25.391
Kids, have you been well?

00:14:28.394 --> 00:14:30.029
A new child has arrived,

00:14:31.197 --> 00:14:32.498
and one is gone.

00:14:36.302 --> 00:14:37.704
- Shall we take a look?
- Yes.

00:14:44.077 --> 00:14:45.044
Don't.

00:14:55.021 --> 00:14:57.423
This one was really hard to get.

00:14:57.991 --> 00:14:59.325
It must be tough on you.

00:15:15.708 --> 00:15:17.510
(D-7)

00:15:17.510 --> 00:15:18.478
Who is it?

00:15:28.388 --> 00:15:29.756
(Would you like to refund your child?)

00:15:29.923 --> 00:15:30.857
A refund?

00:15:35.228 --> 00:15:37.130
(Would you like to refund your child?)

00:15:40.667 --> 00:15:42.569
This is your last chance.

00:15:42.569 --> 00:15:45.004
You're saying I can apply
until this weekend?

00:15:45.004 --> 00:15:46.539
What kind of compensation is offered?

00:15:46.539 --> 00:15:48.942
I'd like a refund in cash.

00:15:49.542 --> 00:15:51.945
Is that possible?

00:15:53.246 --> 00:15:54.314
Of course.

00:15:54.914 --> 00:15:58.051
Since this is the last chance,
everyone's applying for a refund.

00:15:59.619 --> 00:16:02.655
I'm so sick of kids now
I can't even look at them.

00:16:02.655 --> 00:16:07.160
Please note that refunds are
no longer available after this period.

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:09.329
Don't miss this valuable opportunity.

00:16:09.896 --> 00:16:12.098
But still,
you grow attached after raising them.

00:16:12.498 --> 00:16:13.600
How could they just...

00:16:14.801 --> 00:16:15.735
Madam.

00:16:17.103 --> 00:16:20.540
People capable
of such sentimental thoughts...

00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:22.208
do not buy children in the first place.

00:16:23.776 --> 00:16:25.345
However,

00:16:25.845 --> 00:16:27.881
if they did grow attached
while raising them,

00:16:28.648 --> 00:16:30.717
and now can't abandon them
because of that...

00:16:33.119 --> 00:16:34.020
Well,

00:16:35.455 --> 00:16:37.257
foolish and inferior people like that...

00:16:37.257 --> 00:16:39.025
couldn't possibly be my clients.

00:16:41.895 --> 00:16:44.864
I'll take care of it cleanly.

00:16:50.036 --> 00:16:51.070
And you know...

00:16:52.305 --> 00:16:55.608
your husband's DNA is
in my daughter, right?

00:16:57.577 --> 00:16:58.845
She's a healthy child.

00:16:59.379 --> 00:17:02.582
We'll probably get good results next week.

00:17:06.953 --> 00:17:07.820
Yes?

00:17:09.455 --> 00:17:10.823
(D-5)

00:17:20.533 --> 00:17:22.235
(Would you like to refund your child?)

00:17:49.696 --> 00:17:50.763
(Your child is defective.)

00:17:50.763 --> 00:17:51.831
(We'll compensate you
with a perfect child.)

00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:01.474
Yes, ma'am?

00:18:01.975 --> 00:18:04.444
What is this? I received a letter.

00:18:05.612 --> 00:18:09.249
It says my child is defective.
What does that mean?

00:18:09.249 --> 00:18:10.316
Yes, ma'am.

00:18:10.316 --> 00:18:12.852
You wanted to raise Do Hyun
into a baseball player, right?

00:18:13.353 --> 00:18:14.387
Yes, that's right.

00:18:14.387 --> 00:18:16.022
Unfortunately,

00:18:16.022 --> 00:18:19.025
after a comprehensive analysis
of Do Hyun's genetic data,

00:18:19.025 --> 00:18:22.629
physical development,
and athletic performance...

00:18:22.629 --> 00:18:24.330
Why would you analyze that?

00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:27.000
Ma'am, we see records of treatment...

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.369
for a shoulder injury recently.

00:18:29.369 --> 00:18:30.303
Is that right?

00:18:30.303 --> 00:18:33.439
No. That was just a minor sprain.

00:18:33.439 --> 00:18:35.642
It wasn't serious at all.

00:18:35.642 --> 00:18:37.310
He's going to Thailand
for training soon and...

00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:45.418
Just what exactly is so defective
about Do Hyun?

00:18:55.695 --> 00:18:56.663
Is that it?

00:19:18.851 --> 00:19:20.687
I can't see anything.

00:19:20.687 --> 00:19:21.554
Let me see.

00:19:22.121 --> 00:19:23.189
How's it going there?

00:19:23.389 --> 00:19:24.591
Same here.

00:19:26.125 --> 00:19:28.027
What's the refund request rate?

00:19:28.728 --> 00:19:29.863
It's 96 percent.

00:19:30.163 --> 00:19:31.531
What's with the other four percent?

00:19:32.665 --> 00:19:33.933
They've given no response yet.

00:19:34.834 --> 00:19:35.768
Push them.

00:19:36.803 --> 00:19:39.272
Share the non-refund list with me.

00:19:39.272 --> 00:19:41.608
Let's wrap this up fast.
We need to move to the next stage.

00:19:42.075 --> 00:19:43.042
Understood.

00:19:43.042 --> 00:19:44.811
It's been less than a week,

00:19:44.811 --> 00:19:46.846
so 96 percent isn't bad.

00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:49.849
See? I told you.

00:19:51.584 --> 00:19:53.453
Too attached to abandon the kid?

00:19:53.453 --> 00:19:54.554
What a joke.

00:19:57.257 --> 00:19:58.191
Jung Hyun.

00:20:01.427 --> 00:20:02.795
When are you going to kill Ah Hyun?

00:20:05.498 --> 00:20:06.666
You can't do it?

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:08.034
No, I can.

00:20:08.301 --> 00:20:09.435
There's no time.

00:20:09.836 --> 00:20:10.737
Yes.

00:20:35.728 --> 00:20:36.429
What the...

00:21:31.818 --> 00:21:33.219
That woman must die.

00:21:33.219 --> 00:21:34.053
Shut up.

00:21:57.977 --> 00:21:58.912
Tae Sik.

00:22:01.781 --> 00:22:02.749
This is a team member's phone.

00:22:03.883 --> 00:22:04.984
Are you hurt?

00:22:05.251 --> 00:22:06.219
I'm okay.

00:22:15.295 --> 00:22:17.263
(Refund Schedule)

00:22:18.932 --> 00:22:19.832
D-Day?

00:22:22.135 --> 00:22:23.770
It looks like the refund D-day.

00:22:25.705 --> 00:22:29.175
But do refunds ever get initiated
by the organization first?

00:22:30.210 --> 00:22:31.177
No way.

00:22:31.678 --> 00:22:34.681
Refund requests always come from
the parents first, never the organization.

00:22:35.481 --> 00:22:36.849
All of that costs money too, that's why.

00:22:37.850 --> 00:22:40.453
But this isn't a refund request.

00:22:40.954 --> 00:22:42.555
It says "Eligible for Refund."

00:22:48.561 --> 00:22:50.530
(On Hold)

00:22:51.064 --> 00:22:51.965
Lee Do Hyun.

00:22:53.032 --> 00:22:53.933
Seo Eun Jo.

00:22:55.435 --> 00:22:58.504
They're top-priority refund targets.

00:22:59.639 --> 00:23:02.041
Then why are these two
still marked as "on hold?"

00:23:02.675 --> 00:23:05.979
The parents were offered a refund,
but haven't made a decision yet.

00:23:07.413 --> 00:23:08.314
Maybe...

00:23:09.082 --> 00:23:10.884
some parents are a little different.

00:23:14.187 --> 00:23:15.154
Like So Mi's mom.

00:23:26.566 --> 00:23:27.534
(Unknown Sender)

00:23:27.534 --> 00:23:29.669
(Your child is 98.5 percent defective.)

00:23:31.404 --> 00:23:32.372
(Delete All)

00:23:39.779 --> 00:23:42.382
People don't usually doubt delivery texts.

00:23:43.116 --> 00:23:45.018
So I installed malware in the link.

00:23:45.485 --> 00:23:46.619
The moment they click it,

00:23:51.524 --> 00:23:52.959
their phone becomes mine.

00:23:55.595 --> 00:23:56.496
Look.

00:23:56.696 --> 00:23:59.232
Where they are now, where they're going,

00:24:00.099 --> 00:24:01.801
who they're texting with,

00:24:01.801 --> 00:24:03.203
who their family is,

00:24:04.170 --> 00:24:06.773
what's happening to them.
I can see everything.

00:24:09.375 --> 00:24:10.843
Well, the good news is...

00:24:11.377 --> 00:24:14.080
Eun Jo's condition hasn't worsened
since the last time.

00:24:15.648 --> 00:24:16.916
Thank you, Doctor.

00:24:17.784 --> 00:24:20.553
About the treatment
I mentioned last time...

00:24:20.553 --> 00:24:21.955
Well...

00:24:21.955 --> 00:24:25.692
It's a newly developed drug...

00:24:25.692 --> 00:24:27.694
and not covered by insurance in Korea.

00:24:27.694 --> 00:24:29.963
I know the cost is high,

00:24:30.196 --> 00:24:32.799
but it's the best option right now.

00:24:33.399 --> 00:24:35.134
And in Eun Jo's case,

00:24:35.134 --> 00:24:37.971
the disease is progressing faster
than expected.

00:24:40.607 --> 00:24:41.908
There's not much time.

00:24:41.908 --> 00:24:44.577
Is there really no other way?

00:24:45.678 --> 00:24:49.148
Occasionally, institutions
or individuals make donations,

00:24:49.148 --> 00:24:53.152
but those are assigned in order of need
starting with low-income patients.

00:24:53.653 --> 00:24:54.921
But how...

00:24:56.456 --> 00:24:59.425
How can one injection cost
over one million dollars?

00:25:03.062 --> 00:25:03.897
Sir.

00:25:04.597 --> 00:25:06.599
Still, for Eun Jo's sake,

00:25:06.833 --> 00:25:08.735
please think it over one more time.

00:25:18.411 --> 00:25:22.148
Today, we have a special mother
and child guest.

00:25:22.448 --> 00:25:26.219
Baseball fans might recognize him.

00:25:26.219 --> 00:25:28.187
He's already been featured in the media...

00:25:28.187 --> 00:25:30.423
for his pro-level skills.

00:25:30.423 --> 00:25:32.325
This is Lee Do Hyun.

00:25:36.663 --> 00:25:40.466
Sadly, we now have to call him
a former player.

00:25:40.466 --> 00:25:42.702
Due to a serious injury,

00:25:42.702 --> 00:25:44.103
he gave up his dream
of becoming a pitcher...

00:25:44.103 --> 00:25:46.639
and is now seeking a new dream.

00:25:46.639 --> 00:25:48.341
Please tell us what happened.

00:25:55.014 --> 00:25:56.316
Do Hyun.

00:25:56.316 --> 00:25:57.684
Are you okay?

00:25:57.684 --> 00:25:59.085
Do Hyun, are you okay?

00:25:59.085 --> 00:26:00.653
I told you not to push yourself.
Stay still.

00:26:00.653 --> 00:26:02.021
Do Hyun.

00:26:02.255 --> 00:26:05.458
I told you not to overdo it.

00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:10.730
I don't know what to say, ma'am.

00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:16.536
You've been through a lot, Coach.

00:26:16.536 --> 00:26:18.838
Yes, and so have you, ma'am.

00:26:44.464 --> 00:26:46.866
Right now,

00:26:46.866 --> 00:26:49.969
more than regret over giving up his dream,

00:26:49.969 --> 00:26:52.772
I think Do Hyun feels more guilt
and sorrow for his mother.

00:26:52.772 --> 00:26:55.208
That's the kind of loving kid he is.

00:26:55.842 --> 00:26:57.277
Yes, that's true.

00:26:58.678 --> 00:27:00.413
And this is all you have to do
as a mother.

00:27:00.413 --> 00:27:04.484
Show him enough love so he feels it.

00:27:04.484 --> 00:27:06.185
Express it.

00:27:06.185 --> 00:27:08.221
And support his new dream.

00:27:08.688 --> 00:27:11.324
You love him very much, right?

00:27:11.324 --> 00:27:12.158
Yes.

00:27:12.792 --> 00:27:14.227
Do you want to say it out loud?

00:27:14.761 --> 00:27:16.963
I love you, my son.

00:27:17.197 --> 00:27:18.198
Say it.

00:27:21.868 --> 00:27:22.902
My son,

00:27:24.938 --> 00:27:26.239
I love you.

00:27:28.474 --> 00:27:30.076
I sounded so awkward.

00:27:30.944 --> 00:27:32.378
- I did too.
- I know, right?

00:27:35.448 --> 00:27:36.950
You two did great.

00:27:36.950 --> 00:27:39.586
Thank you so much
for inviting us today, Doctor.

00:27:39.586 --> 00:27:41.487
I really feel like we were healed here.

00:27:41.487 --> 00:27:42.989
Thank you so much.

00:27:44.390 --> 00:27:47.393
Do Hyun, would you step outside
for a while? I want to talk to your mom.

00:27:47.393 --> 00:27:48.394
Okay.

00:27:48.862 --> 00:27:49.996
Wait outside.

00:27:57.804 --> 00:27:59.339
Ma'am, it's been tough, hasn't it?

00:28:00.874 --> 00:28:03.643
You struggled for a long time
trying to have a child.

00:28:04.444 --> 00:28:07.180
And you've raised him so wonderfully.

00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:09.582
It's not even your own blood,

00:28:09.582 --> 00:28:11.551
but you raised him so well.
You're amazing.

00:28:12.919 --> 00:28:15.188
I know how much you've struggled.

00:28:15.922 --> 00:28:17.590
You raised him so well.

00:28:17.924 --> 00:28:19.125
But the problem is the genetics.

00:28:20.827 --> 00:28:24.464
I ran a few more tests,

00:28:28.101 --> 00:28:29.969
and Do Hyun's genes weren't good.

00:28:30.837 --> 00:28:33.273
He was never meant to be an athlete.

00:28:34.507 --> 00:28:35.742
Doctor, what do you mean...

00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:43.583
If I raise my voice here,

00:28:43.583 --> 00:28:46.085
everyone outside,
including Do Hyun, will hear.

00:28:46.986 --> 00:28:49.088
If you don't want that, just listen.

00:28:52.158 --> 00:28:55.929
Honestly, isn't it such a waste?
All that money and time spent?

00:28:56.863 --> 00:28:59.699
And now you want
to support his new dream?

00:29:00.333 --> 00:29:01.668
That's nonsense.

00:29:02.835 --> 00:29:05.271
You invested a large amount of money,

00:29:05.271 --> 00:29:07.407
but the child didn't deliver.

00:29:07.407 --> 00:29:09.209
Why should you take the loss?

00:29:10.076 --> 00:29:13.146
You did your best.

00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:16.182
Now go ahead and request a refund.

00:29:36.569 --> 00:29:38.304
(Would you like to refund your child?)

00:29:38.304 --> 00:29:40.039
(3 days left until final refund deadline)

00:29:47.046 --> 00:29:48.147
Yes?

00:29:48.147 --> 00:29:49.649
Is there only one left now?

00:29:52.151 --> 00:29:53.152
(D-2)

00:29:58.825 --> 00:29:59.859
Stay here a moment.

00:30:06.466 --> 00:30:07.333
Hello.

00:30:07.901 --> 00:30:08.868
Hello.

00:30:10.136 --> 00:30:11.170
Please sit down.

00:30:13.172 --> 00:30:14.941
How are you here?

00:30:16.009 --> 00:30:17.243
You look surprised.

00:30:17.477 --> 00:30:18.678
I was asked...

00:30:18.678 --> 00:30:21.414
to speak with you, so I came.

00:30:21.814 --> 00:30:23.783
Then is the doctor in charge today...

00:30:23.783 --> 00:30:25.285
Yes, that's me.

00:30:25.485 --> 00:30:26.553
You must be struggling.

00:30:27.453 --> 00:30:29.656
It's so hard when a child is sick.

00:30:31.958 --> 00:30:33.826
You received the invitation, right, ma'am?

00:30:35.995 --> 00:30:37.964
I can only imagine
how hard it's been emotionally.

00:30:38.298 --> 00:30:40.266
Maybe not as hard as for a sick child.

00:30:40.833 --> 00:30:42.669
Eun Jo must be going through a lot too.

00:30:43.803 --> 00:30:46.005
What are you talking about?

00:30:47.273 --> 00:30:48.341
But ma'am,

00:30:50.143 --> 00:30:52.512
why haven't you given her the injection?

00:30:53.413 --> 00:30:55.515
If you really wanted to save her,

00:30:55.782 --> 00:30:58.418
you should've found a way to get
the money and given her the injection.

00:30:58.418 --> 00:31:00.220
It's not like you're that poor.

00:31:04.257 --> 00:31:05.725
That's the limit.

00:31:05.959 --> 00:31:07.360
Love that hesitates
at one million dollars.

00:31:10.630 --> 00:31:12.365
You should stop now
and request the refund.

00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:16.769
We'll give you a perfect child
until you're satisfied.

00:31:17.503 --> 00:31:19.839
A new Eun Jo. If not her, the next Eun Jo.

00:31:19.839 --> 00:31:21.875
If not, then the next.

00:31:22.542 --> 00:31:25.178
You just keep raising them...

00:31:25.178 --> 00:31:27.113
like you always have.

00:31:28.815 --> 00:31:31.050
To this woman, people are just products.

00:31:31.584 --> 00:31:33.586
Products that are replaceable
if they don't like them.

00:31:56.309 --> 00:31:57.176
Mom.

00:31:57.477 --> 00:31:58.378
Yes?

00:31:58.778 --> 00:32:00.246
You hate me, don't you?

00:32:01.114 --> 00:32:01.981
What?

00:32:02.882 --> 00:32:03.783
Well,

00:32:04.584 --> 00:32:07.186
other kids are good at studying...

00:32:08.021 --> 00:32:09.756
and do cute things.

00:32:10.857 --> 00:32:13.493
But I've never done anything for you, Mom.

00:32:14.227 --> 00:32:16.896
What are you saying?

00:32:23.203 --> 00:32:24.971
I never do anything cute,

00:32:25.638 --> 00:32:27.440
and I only make you suffer.

00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:29.209
Tell me if you need to go to the bathroom.

00:32:29.642 --> 00:32:31.077
You drank a lot of water earlier.

00:32:32.078 --> 00:32:33.046
Sorry.

00:32:34.113 --> 00:32:35.048
Mom.

00:32:39.586 --> 00:32:42.522
Stop talking nonsense and go to sleep.

00:33:05.245 --> 00:33:06.412
Are you okay?

00:33:07.914 --> 00:33:08.781
Yes.

00:33:12.952 --> 00:33:14.487
Honey.

00:33:15.889 --> 00:33:17.824
You got that text too, right?

00:33:19.692 --> 00:33:20.994
That invitation.

00:33:21.361 --> 00:33:22.729
Why do you care about stuff like that?

00:33:23.263 --> 00:33:25.565
No, I just...

00:33:25.565 --> 00:33:27.233
Don't mention that ever again.

00:33:27.967 --> 00:33:29.836
I deleted that text as soon as I got it.

00:33:30.136 --> 00:33:31.371
You delete it too. Right now.

00:33:34.541 --> 00:33:36.476
Okay, I will.

00:33:51.658 --> 00:33:53.159
(Unknown Sender)

00:33:54.994 --> 00:33:56.996

00:33:56.996 --> 00:33:58.932

That's the limit.

00:34:28.027 --> 00:34:29.429
Love that hesitates
at one million dollars.

00:34:35.602 --> 00:34:38.438
(D-1)

00:34:45.011 --> 00:34:46.346
You're Eun Jo's mother, right?

00:34:46.813 --> 00:34:47.714
Yes.

00:34:48.748 --> 00:34:50.516
Can we talk inside for a bit?

00:35:01.027 --> 00:35:04.030
You considered refunding Eun Jo,
didn't you?

00:35:08.334 --> 00:35:10.169
Did you really not know...

00:35:10.770 --> 00:35:11.905
that this is what happens
if Eun Jo is refunded?

00:35:13.473 --> 00:35:14.507
I didn't know...

00:35:16.743 --> 00:35:18.044
that they'd do something this cruel...

00:35:18.945 --> 00:35:19.846
to the children.

00:35:21.147 --> 00:35:22.315
If I had known,

00:35:22.982 --> 00:35:24.817
how could I do that to Eun Jo?

00:35:26.052 --> 00:35:27.387
If it weren't for him,

00:35:28.821 --> 00:35:30.356
I'd already be dead.

00:35:31.891 --> 00:35:33.459
I met a good adult,

00:35:33.860 --> 00:35:35.562
and that's why I'm alive now.

00:35:36.429 --> 00:35:38.698
So Eun Jo and the others...

00:35:39.332 --> 00:35:40.633
can keep on living too,

00:35:42.535 --> 00:35:43.469
please help us.

00:36:39.826 --> 00:36:40.894
(D-day)

00:36:43.196 --> 00:36:44.831
Are you ready to meet the kids?

00:36:45.198 --> 00:36:46.099
Yes.

00:36:46.533 --> 00:36:49.402
Good, let's wipe them all out.

00:37:14.761 --> 00:37:16.196
Do Hyun, give me your phone.

00:37:16.863 --> 00:37:17.864
My phone?

00:37:17.864 --> 00:37:21.100
They say it's the rule
in the camp. No phones.

00:37:21.100 --> 00:37:22.535
Okay. Here.

00:37:22.535 --> 00:37:23.536
Thanks.

00:37:35.515 --> 00:37:36.482
Listen carefully.

00:37:37.083 --> 00:37:38.751
What's more important
than revenge is you guys.

00:37:39.719 --> 00:37:41.354
Don't get hurt, no matter what.

00:37:42.288 --> 00:37:44.557
Don't worry. We can do this.

00:37:45.992 --> 00:37:47.227
Ah Hyun, I'm counting on you.

00:37:47.627 --> 00:37:48.528
Yes.

00:37:49.362 --> 00:37:50.697
Si Woo, you stay safe too.

00:37:51.764 --> 00:37:52.432
Okay.

00:37:54.234 --> 00:37:55.068
Let's go.

00:37:55.702 --> 00:37:56.536
Yes.

00:37:56.536 --> 00:37:57.370
Let's go.

00:38:16.656 --> 00:38:18.391
(Camping With Mom and Dad)

00:38:23.796 --> 00:38:26.432
Dr. Kim Se Hee is really
such a kind person.

00:38:26.966 --> 00:38:28.434
She even invited us to this event.

00:38:29.836 --> 00:38:33.039
Right? It looks really fun, doesn't it?

00:38:33.773 --> 00:38:34.607
Yes.

Do Hyun.

00:39:29.429 --> 00:39:30.263
Let's go.

00:39:35.435 --> 00:39:36.469
Okay.

00:39:38.504 --> 00:39:39.572
Are all the kids here?

00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:41.841
Except for one.

00:39:47.747 --> 00:39:48.681
Mom.

00:40:00.260 --> 00:40:02.462
- Mom.
- Yes?

00:40:02.462 --> 00:40:03.296
Wait for me.

00:40:09.936 --> 00:40:12.171
It would've been better
if Dad came with us.

00:40:13.139 --> 00:40:14.374
But I don't like him.

00:40:16.776 --> 00:40:18.344
I'm so happy I came with you, Mom.

00:40:19.612 --> 00:40:22.815
Se Hee, what are you going to make for me?

00:40:22.815 --> 00:40:24.350
Curry, your favorite.

00:40:25.585 --> 00:40:26.920
That sounds delicious.

00:40:28.354 --> 00:40:31.791
I'll go get something from the car.

00:40:32.392 --> 00:40:33.526
Make the curry while I do that.

00:40:33.927 --> 00:40:34.794
Okay.

00:40:37.197 --> 00:40:38.231
I'll be right back.

00:40:38.565 --> 00:40:39.399
Okay.

00:40:52.545 --> 00:40:53.546

Mom.

00:41:59.746 --> 00:42:02.115
I've arrived. Where is everyone?

00:42:08.454 --> 00:42:09.489
How did you get here?

00:43:17.790 --> 00:43:18.758
Everyone,

00:43:19.626 --> 00:43:21.127
thank you for waiting.

00:43:26.799 --> 00:43:29.569
We'll now begin the game.

00:43:35.141 --> 00:43:38.311
The survival game begins now.

00:43:39.279 --> 00:43:40.179
Mom.

00:43:45.285 --> 00:43:46.252
Mom.

00:43:48.121 --> 00:43:49.689
The rules are simple.

00:43:49.989 --> 00:43:52.792
Don't die. Just survive.

00:43:53.359 --> 00:43:54.727
If you get shot, you die.

00:43:55.028 --> 00:43:55.962

00:43:55.962 --> 00:43:58.298
- As you run and hide from the guns,
- Lift your gun.

00:43:58.298 --> 00:43:59.566
- you'll come to realize...
- Mom.

00:43:59.566 --> 00:44:01.301
- Mom.
- that surviving isn't...

00:44:01.301 --> 00:44:02.936
easy at all.

00:44:03.970 --> 00:44:06.839
Right, and one more rule.

00:44:07.774 --> 00:44:11.644
No matter what,
you must never call "Mom" or "Dad."

00:44:12.312 --> 00:44:15.515
If you do, you die immediately.

00:44:15.515 --> 00:44:18.318
Now, let the game begin.

00:44:18.585 --> 00:44:19.786
- No.
- Ready.

00:44:20.587 --> 00:44:22.622
Set. Go.

00:44:26.526 --> 00:44:28.094

Congratulations.
I heard you got another scholarship.

Genius kids are different.
Are you born gifted?

00:44:58.825 --> 00:45:01.461
So what? Trash blood is still trash.

Don't say that.

00:45:03.630 --> 00:45:05.265
It's good blood if it wins scholarships.

Let's go.

00:45:08.268 --> 00:45:09.802
We should celebrate...

00:45:10.336 --> 00:45:12.338
since she's getting another scholarship.

00:45:12.338 --> 00:45:13.506

00:45:13.506 --> 00:45:14.474
Move.

00:45:15.875 --> 00:45:18.545
- Hurry up.
- Keep walking.

00:45:18.811 --> 00:45:20.046
Guys, kick her.

00:45:20.780 --> 00:45:21.814
Damn it.

00:45:21.814 --> 00:45:22.715
She stinks.

00:45:23.516 --> 00:45:24.784
How gross.

00:45:25.752 --> 00:45:26.753
Enough.

00:45:27.520 --> 00:45:29.022
We should still give her a gift.

00:46:02.889 --> 00:46:04.257
Let's just end this.

00:46:19.038 --> 00:46:21.374
(I love you, Mom.)

00:47:04.083 --> 00:47:06.586
(Special thanks
to Hwang Seog Jeong for her appearance)

00:47:06.986 --> 00:47:09.622
(The Defects)

00:47:09.622 --> 00:47:12.659
Now we're all on the same boat.

00:47:13.059 --> 00:47:15.762
I'm going to kill...

00:47:15.762 --> 00:47:16.963
my own child today too.

00:47:16.963 --> 00:47:18.531
We have to find Kim Se Hee.

00:47:18.531 --> 00:47:20.266
We must stop this
before the refunds begin.

00:47:20.266 --> 00:47:22.936
How dare she deceive me and my husband!

00:47:22.936 --> 00:47:24.437
She's a total lunatic.

00:47:24.437 --> 00:47:25.538
Woo Tae Sik.

00:47:26.973 --> 00:47:27.907
Tae Sik!

00:47:27.907 --> 00:47:30.009
Uncle, that's enough now.

00:47:30.510 --> 00:47:33.713
Director, you can abandon me now.

00:47:34.447 --> 00:47:35.548
Get Kim Ah Hyun.

00:47:35.949 --> 00:47:37.817
You said all a child needs is love.

00:47:37.817 --> 00:47:39.652
Then why didn't you give that to me?

00:47:39.652 --> 00:47:42.155
There are mothers like me in this world...

00:47:42.155 --> 00:47:43.823
and daughters like you...

00:47:43.823 --> 00:47:45.425
who get killed by mothers like me.

00:47:47.599 --> 00:47:49.599
